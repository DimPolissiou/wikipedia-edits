Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \"gearheads\"<ref>Band bio at www.btorocks.com.</ref> (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\", \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", and \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of [[Randy Bachman]] (lead guitar, lead vocals), [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] (bass guitar, lead vocals), [[Tim Bachman]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Robbie Bachman]] (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured [[Blair Thornton]] (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success.\n\nAfter the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a [[Bachman & Turner|new album]]. In 2010, they played the halftime show at the [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]]. The two stopped touring following Turner's amicable retirement in March 2018.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/randy-bachman-says-bto-bandmate-fred-turner-will-retire-from-touring-1.3838468 |title=Randy Bachman says BTO bandmate Fred Turner will retire from touring |date=March 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2014, the classic ''[[Not Fragile]]'' line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in performing in a tribute version of \"Takin' Care of Business\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history 1971\u20131973===\nAfter leaving [[The Guess Who]] at the height of that band's success, Randy Bachman recalled being labelled \"a lunatic and a loser\" and that \"nobody wanted to work with me\". The exception was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], former Guess Who lead singer who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family.<ref name=Heatley>{{cite web|url= http://www.teamrock.com/features/2014-05-02/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive |title=The Turbulent History of Bachman-Turner Overdrive |last=Heatley|first=Michael |publisher=teamrock.com |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The result was the band [[Brave Belt]], formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy's brother [[Robbie Bachman|Robin \"Robbie\" Bachman]] on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt's self-titled first album, which saw Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, did not sell particularly well. The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of [[Neil Young]]) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist [[Fred Turner (musician)|C. F. (\"Fred\") Turner]] to perform in the band's scheduled gigs.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions\", 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nTurner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of ''Brave Belt II'' in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two ''Brave Belt II'' songs, but left the band shortly after the album's recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, [[Tim Bachman]], was added as a second guitarist because the band had felt their three-piece arrangement was too restrictive.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> ''Brave Belt II'' also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner's influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the ''Brave Belt II'' album. ''Brave Belt II'' had a harder, more guitar-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner's throaty, powerful voice.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\", article at [http://www.allpar.com allpar.com]</ref>\n\nAccording to Randy Bachman's autobiography, the seeds of the BTO sound were sown at a university gig in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], shortly after Allan's departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan's country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from [[Toronto]]. When that didn't materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like \"Proud Mary\", \"Brown Sugar\" and \"All Right Now\", the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, \"We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nAfter [[Reprise Records]] dropped Brave Belt from their label, Randy Bachman emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the ''Brave Belt II'' lineup, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, \"I went to A&M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum \u2013 you name it. A week later, I\u2019d get letters saying \u2018Dear Randy, We pass.\u2019 We\u2019re thinking of calling our greatest hits album ''We Pass'' and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I\u2019ve got all 22 of them.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74>{{cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs178-bachman-turner-overdrive/ |title=Rolling Stone #178: Bachman-Turner Overdrive |website=theuncool.com |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band eventually landed a deal with [[Mercury Records]], one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973, Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of unplayed demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman's name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rod Stewart]] to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them.<ref name=Heatley/> Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:\n\n{{quote|I could hear \"Gimme Your Money Please\" playing in the background, and that was the first song on the tape. Back then, you sent out two  {{Sfrac|7|1|2}}-inch reels of your album, an A-side and a B-side, and that was side one, cut one. He said, \"Randy, this is fabulous. Is the rest of the album like this?\" And I said, \"Yeah, it's all just good ol', dancing rock-and-roll.\" So he said, \"Well, I have a meeting with my A&R people, but as far as I'm concerned, this is great and I want to sign it.\"<ref>Interview track on ''King Biscuit: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive'', King Biscuit Flower Hour Records</ref>}}\n\nAt this point the band's demo tape was still called ''Brave Belt III''. Fach convinced the band that a brand new name was needed; one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (\u00e0 la [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]). While on their way back from a gig in [[Toronto]], the group had spotted a copy of a trucker's magazine called ''Overdrive'' while dining at the Colonial Steak House in [[Windsor, Ontario]], run by Colonial Jim Lambros. After this, Turner wrote \"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\" and the initials \"B.T.O.\" on a [[napkin]]. The rest of the band decided the addition of \"[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\" was the perfect way to describe their music.<ref>\"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Biography\" at [http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ SongResource.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051317/http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBTO released their eponymous [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|first album]] in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as [[Detroit]]<ref name=\"enotesBTO\">Contemporary Musicians/Bachman-Turner Overdrive bio at [http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bachman-turner-overdrive-biography enotes.com]</ref> and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single.  The Turner-penned \"Blue Collar\" reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album's eventual success was very much the result of the band's relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive immediately travelled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.\n\nOne such opportunity occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Recalled Fred Turner, \"We got a call from radio station [[KSHE]] that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren't coming. We had the ''BTO I'' album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states&nbsp;\u2013 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, 'What the hell's happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!' We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn't know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO>Einarson, John. Booklet insert for the ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive 40th Anniversary'' CD.</ref>\n\nBacked by manager Bruce Allen, the band logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. ''BTO I'' would later be certified gold in 1974 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n===Breakthrough and success 1973\u20131976===\nBTO's second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]'', was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the ''RPM'' albums chart). It was originally to be titled \"Adrenaline Rush\". It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\" and \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".  While \"Let It Ride\" was BTO's first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at #23), \"Takin' Care of Business\" would become one of the band's most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of \"Takin' Care of Business\" several years earlier as \"White Collar Worker\" while in [[The Guess Who]], but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO's repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, \"To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.\" Randy had heard DJ Darryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, \"We're takin' care of business on C-Fox radio\", and he decided to insert the lyrics \"takin' care of business\" into the chorus where \"white collar worker\" previously existed.<ref name=\"RBinterview\">Gary James interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com classicbands.com]</ref>\n\nTim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II''. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 ''Rolling Stone'' interview: \"I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74/> Some other accounts state that Tim left because he was getting married and wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> But in a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, \"He was basically asked to leave. He wasn't BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.\"<ref name=\"Markafterdark\">\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive\". Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at [http://www.newyorkwaste.com newyorkwaste.com]</ref>\n\nBTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for ''BTO II'', Tim was replaced by [[Blair Thornton]]. Thornton had been in the [[Vancouver]]-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, ''[[Not Fragile]]'' (a play on the hit album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\"<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Hits |isbn=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref> and [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] favourite \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\". ''Not Fragile'' remains BTO's top-selling non-compilation album, selling eight million copies to date.\n\n1975 found the band engaged in highly successful tours of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by [[Thin Lizzy]], an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy, \"Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with [[Phil Lynott|Phil]] and the boys for seven or eight months.\"<ref name=Heatley/> With management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded ''[[Four Wheel Drive (album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' in May 1975, which included the single \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\". Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, \"Hey You\" would become BTO's second No. 1 single on the Canadian ''RPM'' charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada. \n\nThe band went on to record and release ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]'' in late 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", which featured a guest appearance by [[Little Richard]] who wailed away on his piano. ''Head On'' also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out for #1]]\", which reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single \"[[Down to the Line (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Down to the Line]]\". This song would appear on some of the later compilation CD's, as well as on re-issues of the ''Head On'' album in CD format. ''Head On'' would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976.\n\nThe first BTO compilation album, ''[[Best of B.T.O. (So Far)]]'', was released in 1976 and featured songs from each of the band's first five studio albums. A single\u2014a re-release of \"Gimme Your Money Please\"\u2014was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM & FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.<ref name=\"riaa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org |title=RIAA - Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=riaa.org |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Randy's departure and the new \"BTO\" 1977\u20131979===\n[[File:Bto-1991.jpg|thumb|right|BTO in [[\u00d6rebro]], Sweden, April 1991 <br /> L-R: Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton, Robbie Bachman]]\n''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', BTO's sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signalled the end of BTO's most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the \"sameness\" of the band's songs on the two follow-up albums to ''Not Fragile'', Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO's sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:\n\n{{quote|Since he (Randy) was funding the whole thing, everything went on his and Mercury's timetable. It finally came to a head for ''Freeways'' when Blair, Rob and myself told Randy we were burnt out, didn't like the songs we were writing, didn't like the songs he was writing, and that we wanted to take some time to regroup {{ndash}} especially since all the other bands were taking a year or two between albums, not doing two a year like we were. Randy told us his songs were fine and forced the album. It ended that version of the band.<ref name=Heatley/>}}\n\nYears later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, \"Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that's what a lot of great bands do. And we didn't.\"<ref name=Heatley/> ''Freeways'' only reached #70 on the US pop albums chart and had no charting singles.\n\nRandy Bachman left the group following ''Freeways''. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, \"But it was decided by management it wouldn't work.\" He conceded, \"We also ran out of common interests.\"<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/>\n\nRandy was replaced by bassist [[Jim Clench]], formerly of [[April Wine]]. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as \"BTO\" because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career.<ref name=\"RBinterview\"/> While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to \"BTO\" and the gear logo.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> The re-structured BTO released ''[[Street Action]]'' in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, spawning no hit singles.\n\nThe band also released ''[[Rock n' Roll Nights]]'' in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly [[Prism (band)|Prism]]'s [[Jim Vallance]], who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with [[Bryan Adams]]. But like its predecessor, ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called \"Heartaches\". Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US.<ref>The song was later a hit for [[Anne Murray]], from her ''[[Something to Talk About (album)|Something to Talk About]]'' album (1986).</ref> BTO played this song on [[American Bandstand]] in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called \"[[Jamaica (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Jamaica]]\". Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on ''[[Bryan Adams (album)|Bryan Adams]]''' debut album in 1980 as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} (Adams had likewise contributed one song, \"Wastin' Time\", for BTO for the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' album).\n\nOn November 3, 2010, [[Jim Clench]] died in a [[Montreal]] hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.<ref name=\"thestar\">{{cite news|title=April Wine and BTO former bassist Jim Clench dies|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/886479--jim-clench-bassist-with-april-wine-and-bto-dies-at-61|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=TheStar.com|location=Toronto|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|title=CBC News \u2013 Music \u2013 April Wine, BTO musician Jim Clench dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/11/05/jim-clench-obit.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=CBC.ca|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lives Remembered \u2013 Telegraph \u2013 Jim Clench|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8124442/Lives-Remembered.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|title=The Gazette (Montreal) \u2013 Obituaries|url=http://www.legacy.com/can-montreal/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=146420804|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Legacy.com via MontrealGazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979\u20131991===\n\nBTO completed the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' tour in late 1979, and officially disbanded in early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]'' in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived [[Ironhorse]] in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, ''Ironhorse'' and ''Everything Is Grey'', before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as \"Union\", released one album in 1981 entitled ''On Strike''. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy Bachman.\n\nBTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner, joined by former [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] drummer [[Garry Peterson]] and [[Billy Chapman (musician)|Billy Chapman]], their drum tech, on piano & keyboards. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and [[trademark]] disagreements with Randy and the others:\n\n{{quote|When Randy wanted to get back together again, I said, \"Okay, let's have a publishing company with the band. Let's all write the tunes. We'll all share equally and there won't be any more animosity.\" He said no, so I got up and left. Blair wasn't asked to rejoin because Randy knew that Blair wouldn't take any crap like Timmy would. They went out and started to use the name BTO within a year and the same trademark that Randy sold to us! So Blair and I sued him and we won. They had to pay us royalties.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/>}}\n\nIn Randy's 2000 autobiography, ''Takin' Care of Business'', he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.\n\nThe new album, simply (and confusingly) titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|BTO]]'', was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach's new Compleat label. \"For the Weekend\", a song from this album, was released as a single and had a companion music video. It dented the US charts at No. 83, making it the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and also the last.\n\nIn 1986, they released a live album culled from their 1985 tour called ''[[Live Live Live|Live! Live! Live!]]'' which featured two new tracks, \"Bad News Travels Fast\" and \"Fragile Man\". The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of \"Bad News Travels Fast\" was released on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]''. They were the opening band for the new [[Sammy Hagar]]-fronted [[Van Halen]] on their ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred's voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen's management.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing [[softball]] during the group's downtime on the road.\n\nAfter the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see line-ups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman later became the drummer for Randy Bachman's band and drummed on Randy's 1993 solo album Any Road.\n\nIn 1988, the 1974\u201377 ''Not Fragile'' line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song \"[[Wooly Bully]]\", which is only available on the ''[[American Boyfriends]]'' movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on another project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.\n\n===''Trial by Fire'' era (1991\u20132005)===\nRandy Bachman was replaced by [[Randy Murray]] after his last departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman's 1987\u201388 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. ''[[Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest]]'' was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.\n\nThe sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, \"They said, 'We'll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you're not there.' The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It's like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I'm there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they've got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there's this inference that I'm there and I'm not there, which is a disservice to the fans.\"<ref>Interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com/RandyBachmanInterview.html classicbands.com]</ref> Replied brother Robbie, \"Randy Murray doesn't fill anyone's shoes. He brings his own.\"<ref>BTO bio at [http://www.canadianbands.com/BTO.html canadianbands.com].</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] voted to induct Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the ''Not Fragile'' line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as \"BTO\" without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted (the \"classic\" lineup of Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman would eventually be inducted - by astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]] - in 2014).<ref>http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/bachman-turner-overdrive/</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs.<ref>A clip of one song from those recordings, \"Can't Take It with You\", is available along with the interview at [http://www.btorocks.com btorocks.com]</ref> It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the ''Trial by Fire'' CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.\n\n===Hiatus 2005\u20132009===\nSince the last disbandment of the band in 2005, several of their albums have been reissued. The first one to be made available again since the disbandment was ''Freeways'' in 2005, followed by ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II'' in 2006 and ''Four Wheel Drive'' in 2008. ''Brave Belt I'' and ''Brave Belt II'' were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?r=1&EAN=664140644724&ourl=Brave%2DBelt%2DI%2DBrave%2DBelt%2DII%2FBrave%2DBelt |title=Brave Belt I/Brave Belt II, Brave Belt, Music CD - Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rob and Blair have remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob has been rumoured to state he no longer wishes to play in the band and has hung up his drum sticks.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman's shows, the first time they had played on stage together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show \"Randy's Vinyl Tap\", was slated to be the host of a new television show called \"Road to Guitar\", which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.\n\nRandy Murray still plays occasional shows around the Vancouver area. He is the only ''Trial by Fire''\u2013era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.\n\n===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009\u20132018===\n{{further|Bachman & Turner}}\nDue to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009 in their hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nInformation on the 2010 Bachman & Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website ''bachmanandturner.com''. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, \"Rock 'n Roll Is the Only Way Out\". But after hearing the track with Turner's vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.<ref>Bios at [http://www.bachmanandturner.com bachmanandturner.com].</ref><ref>Randy Bachman interview at [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/randy-bachman-0611/ gibson.com]</ref>\n\nOn September 12, 2009, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F. Turner would reunite to play concert dates in Europe, Canada and the US in 2010 backed by Randy's current band of Marc LaFrance, Mick Dalla-Vee and Brent Howard, billed simply as Bachman & Turner. Some early confirmed tour dates announced were June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival and the High Voltage Festival in July 2010 at London UK; the story added that there was also interest from agents as far away as South America and Australia.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Rob |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/bachman-turner-takin-care-of-business-59119202.html |title=Bachman, Turner takin' care of business |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe tour and album plans of 'Bachman & Turner' resulted in a lawsuit by Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton regarding ownership of the band name and related trademarks.<ref>Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] have encountered similar difficulties in relation to the [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] name, which is owned by original bassist [[Jim Kale]], which has resulted in Bachman & Cummings touring since 2005 as simply Bachman-Cummings rather than The Guess Who; see [[The Guess Who]].</ref> Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton claim that US and Canadian rights in the BTO name and trademark were transferred to Rob Bachman, Blair Thornton and Fred Turner when Randy Bachman commenced a solo career in 1977.<ref>Ownership of rights in relation to the name(s) outside of the United States and Canada are uncertain.</ref><ref>It is unclear whether this claim relates to both \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", or solely the latter.</ref> Randy Bachman is said to have registered the names \"Bachman-Turner\", \"BTU\", \"Bachman-Turner United\" and \"Bachman-Turner Union\" in both the United States and Canada.<ref>The current status of European or global ownership of the band name(s) and trademarks is uncertain.</ref> These names are said to cause confusion with the names \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", resulting in potential damages to Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton.<ref>Dan Ferguson, [http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html Battle Over Bachman-Turner Overdrive Name] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109204730/http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html |date=November 9, 2009 }}; Surrey North Delta Leader, November 3, 2009.</ref> There appeared to be general legal agreement that one could perform under one's own legal names such as \"Bachman & Turner\", so the newly reunited pair were billed as such for the 2010 tour and album.  The band played the halftime show at the 2010 [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe rock duo's self-titled album, ''[[Bachman & Turner]]'', was released September 7, 2010 in North America and on September 20, 2010 in Europe.  In November 2010, they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour. A double live album ([[Live at the Roseland Ballroom, NYC]]) was recorded at that show, which was also filmed and will be released on DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. / Line-up:\nRandy Bachman (guitars, vocals); C.F. Turner (bass, vocals); Marc LaFrance (drums, percussion, vocals); Brent Howard Knudsen (guitars, vocals); Mick Dalla-Vee (guitars, vocals).\n\nCapitalizing on the recent Bachman & Turner album and supporting shows, BTO released another compilation set in 2013: ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary]]''.  It has 26 songs on two CDs. Much of the collection had been released before, but there were four previously unreleased songs, including \"Rough Ride\" from the 1984 ''BTO'' reunion album sessions and \"West Coast Turnaround\" from the 1975 ''Head On'' sessions.<ref name=BTO40th>[https://www.discogs.com/Bachman-Turner-Overdrive-40th-Anniversary-Deluxe-Edition/release/10218353 BachmanTurner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary (Deluxe Edition)] Track listing at discogs.com, retrieved January 3, 2019.</ref> The CD set also features one Brave Belt song (\"Never Comin' Home\"), and eight songs on disc two are from the long out-of-print ''[[B.T.O. Live \u2013 Japan Tour]]'' album from 1976. Disc two also adds live versions of \"Blue Collar\" and \"Give It Time\", recorded at the same Japan concerts but not released on the vinyl edition.<ref name=BTO40th/> On March 10, 2018, Randy Bachman announced that Fred Turner would be retiring from touring.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\"/>\n\n==Impact and influence==\nBTO has been recognized in many music circles for carrying on the torch of guitar-heavy rock and roll at a time when soft rock was dominating the Top 40 charts, and progressive and glam acts were getting an increasing share of FM radio play. As drummer Rob Bachman put it: \"We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and the funky kinds of rock bands like [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]]. Luckily for us, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|Creedence]] had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner's gruff voice. So it was basically this working man's kind of rock-and-roll.\"\n\nA reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO's legacy:\n\n{{quote|Dave Marsh noted that the band peaked with ''Not Fragile'', an album that \"seemed to exhaust Bachman's imagination; everything before and since is simply sluggish.\" The band's entry in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' acknowledges BTO's limitations, while properly assessing their assets: \"However much it might be open to derision as formula cash-register boogie, BTO's rock is at least dexterously played and arranged, with dynamics reminiscent of mid-period [[Led Zeppelin]].\" For a period during the mid-1970s, BTO enjoyed high sales, steady radio play, and sold out arena shows.<ref name=\"enotesBTO\"/>}}\n\nStated John Einarson, author of the biography ''Randy Bachman: Still Takin' Care of Business'', \"If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] derived his [[Richard Bachman]] pen name from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive when he was listening to the band's song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#1.6\n|title=Stephen King FAQ: 'Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?'\n|author=King, Stephen\n|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Saddlesore Galactica]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRandy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'', making a cameo performing the song \"Taking Care of Business\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-campaign-set-visit/|title=20 Things to Know from THE CAMPAIGN Set Visit|last=Wampler|first=Scott|date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" was also the title of a 1990 [[Taking Care of Business (film)|movie]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[World Series]] and finds the [[Filofax]] of businessman [[Charles Grodin]].

However, the pronunciation of {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u0251\u02d0|k|m|\u0259n}} has become widespread, especially on American radio.</ref> often abbreviated as '''BTO''', was a [[Canadian rock]] group from [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], who had a series of hit albums and singles in the 1970s, selling over 7 million albums in that decade alone. Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \"gearheads\"<ref>Band bio at www.btorocks.com.</ref> (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\", \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", and \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of [[Randy Bachman]] (lead guitar, lead vocals), [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] (bass guitar, lead vocals), [[Tim Bachman]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Robbie Bachman]] (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured [[Blair Thornton]] (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success.\n\nAfter the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a [[Bachman & Turner|new album]]. In 2010, they played the halftime show at the [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]]. The two stopped touring following Turner's amicable retirement in March 2018.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/randy-bachman-says-bto-bandmate-fred-turner-will-retire-from-touring-1.3838468 |title=Randy Bachman says BTO bandmate Fred Turner will retire from touring |date=March 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2014, the classic ''[[Not Fragile]]'' line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in performing in a tribute version of \"Takin' Care of Business\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history 1971\u20131973===\nAfter leaving [[The Guess Who]] at the height of that band's success, Randy Bachman recalled being labelled \"a lunatic and a loser\" and that \"nobody wanted to work with me\". The exception was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], former Guess Who lead singer who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family.<ref name=Heatley>{{cite web|url= http://www.teamrock.com/features/2014-05-02/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive |title=The Turbulent History of Bachman-Turner Overdrive |last=Heatley|first=Michael |publisher=teamrock.com |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The result was the band [[Brave Belt]], formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy's brother [[Robbie Bachman|Robin \"Robbie\" Bachman]] on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt's self-titled first album, which saw Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, did not sell particularly well. The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of [[Neil Young]]) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist [[Fred Turner (musician)|C. F. (\"Fred\") Turner]] to perform in the band's scheduled gigs.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions\", 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nTurner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of ''Brave Belt II'' in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two ''Brave Belt II'' songs, but left the band shortly after the album's recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, [[Tim Bachman]], was added as a second guitarist because the band had felt their three-piece arrangement was too restrictive.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> ''Brave Belt II'' also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner's influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the ''Brave Belt II'' album. ''Brave Belt II'' had a harder, more guitar-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner's throaty, powerful voice.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\", article at [http://www.allpar.com allpar.com]</ref>\n\nAccording to Randy Bachman's autobiography, the seeds of the BTO sound were sown at a university gig in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], shortly after Allan's departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan's country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from [[Toronto]]. When that didn't materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like \"Proud Mary\", \"Brown Sugar\" and \"All Right Now\", the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, \"We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nAfter [[Reprise Records]] dropped Brave Belt from their label, Randy Bachman emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the ''Brave Belt II'' lineup, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, \"I went to A&M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum \u2013 you name it. A week later, I\u2019d get letters saying \u2018Dear Randy, We pass.\u2019 We\u2019re thinking of calling our greatest hits album ''We Pass'' and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I\u2019ve got all 22 of them.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74>{{cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs178-bachman-turner-overdrive/ |title=Rolling Stone #178: Bachman-Turner Overdrive |website=theuncool.com |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band eventually landed a deal with [[Mercury Records]], one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973, Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of unplayed demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman's name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rod Stewart]] to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them.<ref name=Heatley/> Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:\n\n{{quote|I could hear \"Gimme Your Money Please\" playing in the background, and that was the first song on the tape. Back then, you sent out two  {{Sfrac|7|1|2}}-inch reels of your album, an A-side and a B-side, and that was side one, cut one. He said, \"Randy, this is fabulous. Is the rest of the album like this?\" And I said, \"Yeah, it's all just good ol', dancing rock-and-roll.\" So he said, \"Well, I have a meeting with my A&R people, but as far as I'm concerned, this is great and I want to sign it.\"<ref>Interview track on ''King Biscuit: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive'', King Biscuit Flower Hour Records</ref>}}\n\nAt this point the band's demo tape was still called ''Brave Belt III''. Fach convinced the band that a brand new name was needed; one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (\u00e0 la [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]). While on their way back from a gig in [[Toronto]], the group had spotted a copy of a trucker's magazine called ''Overdrive'' while dining at the Colonial Steak House in [[Windsor, Ontario]], run by Colonial Jim Lambros. After this, Turner wrote \"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\" and the initials \"B.T.O.\" on a [[napkin]]. The rest of the band decided the addition of \"[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\" was the perfect way to describe their music.<ref>\"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Biography\" at [http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ SongResource.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051317/http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBTO released their eponymous [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|first album]] in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as [[Detroit]]<ref name=\"enotesBTO\">Contemporary Musicians/Bachman-Turner Overdrive bio at [http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bachman-turner-overdrive-biography enotes.com]</ref> and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single.  The Turner-penned \"Blue Collar\" reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album's eventual success was very much the result of the band's relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive immediately travelled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.\n\nOne such opportunity occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Recalled Fred Turner, \"We got a call from radio station [[KSHE]] that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren't coming. We had the ''BTO I'' album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states&nbsp;\u2013 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, 'What the hell's happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!' We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn't know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO>Einarson, John. Booklet insert for the ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive 40th Anniversary'' CD.</ref>\n\nBacked by manager Bruce Allen, the band logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. ''BTO I'' would later be certified gold in 1974 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n===Breakthrough and success 1973\u20131976===\nBTO's second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]'', was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the ''RPM'' albums chart). It was originally to be titled \"Adrenaline Rush\". It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\" and \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".  While \"Let It Ride\" was BTO's first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at #23), \"Takin' Care of Business\" would become one of the band's most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of \"Takin' Care of Business\" several years earlier as \"White Collar Worker\" while in [[The Guess Who]], but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO's repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, \"To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.\" Randy had heard DJ Darryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, \"We're takin' care of business on C-Fox radio\", and he decided to insert the lyrics \"takin' care of business\" into the chorus where \"white collar worker\" previously existed.<ref name=\"RBinterview\">Gary James interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com classicbands.com]</ref>\n\nTim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II''. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 ''Rolling Stone'' interview: \"I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74/> Some other accounts state that Tim left because he was getting married and wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> But in a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, \"He was basically asked to leave. He wasn't BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.\"<ref name=\"Markafterdark\">\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive\". Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at [http://www.newyorkwaste.com newyorkwaste.com]</ref>\n\nBTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for ''BTO II'', Tim was replaced by [[Blair Thornton]]. Thornton had been in the [[Vancouver]]-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, ''[[Not Fragile]]'' (a play on the hit album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\"<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Hits |isbn=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref> and [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] favourite \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\". ''Not Fragile'' remains BTO's top-selling non-compilation album, selling eight million copies to date.\n\n1975 found the band engaged in highly successful tours of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by [[Thin Lizzy]], an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy, \"Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with [[Phil Lynott|Phil]] and the boys for seven or eight months.\"<ref name=Heatley/> With management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded ''[[Four Wheel Drive (album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' in May 1975, which included the single \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\". Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, \"Hey You\" would become BTO's second No. 1 single on the Canadian ''RPM'' charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada. \n\nThe band went on to record and release ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]'' in late 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", which featured a guest appearance by [[Little Richard]] who wailed away on his piano. ''Head On'' also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out for #1]]\", which reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single \"[[Down to the Line (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Down to the Line]]\". This song would appear on some of the later compilation CD's, as well as on re-issues of the ''Head On'' album in CD format. ''Head On'' would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976.\n\nThe first BTO compilation album, ''[[Best of B.T.O. (So Far)]]'', was released in 1976 and featured songs from each of the band's first five studio albums. A single\u2014a re-release of \"Gimme Your Money Please\"\u2014was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM & FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.<ref name=\"riaa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org |title=RIAA - Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=riaa.org |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Randy's departure and the new \"BTO\" 1977\u20131979===\n[[File:Bto-1991.jpg|thumb|right|BTO in [[\u00d6rebro]], Sweden, April 1991 <br /> L-R: Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton, Robbie Bachman]]\n''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', BTO's sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signalled the end of BTO's most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the \"sameness\" of the band's songs on the two follow-up albums to ''Not Fragile'', Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO's sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:\n\n{{quote|Since he (Randy) was funding the whole thing, everything went on his and Mercury's timetable. It finally came to a head for ''Freeways'' when Blair, Rob and myself told Randy we were burnt out, didn't like the songs we were writing, didn't like the songs he was writing, and that we wanted to take some time to regroup {{ndash}} especially since all the other bands were taking a year or two between albums, not doing two a year like we were. Randy told us his songs were fine and forced the album. It ended that version of the band.<ref name=Heatley/>}}\n\nYears later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, \"Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that's what a lot of great bands do. And we didn't.\"<ref name=Heatley/> ''Freeways'' only reached #70 on the US pop albums chart and had no charting singles.\n\nRandy Bachman left the group following ''Freeways''. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, \"But it was decided by management it wouldn't work.\" He conceded, \"We also ran out of common interests.\"<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/>\n\nRandy was replaced by bassist [[Jim Clench]], formerly of [[April Wine]]. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as \"BTO\" because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career.<ref name=\"RBinterview\"/> While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to \"BTO\" and the gear logo.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> The re-structured BTO released ''[[Street Action]]'' in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, spawning no hit singles.\n\nThe band also released ''[[Rock n' Roll Nights]]'' in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly [[Prism (band)|Prism]]'s [[Jim Vallance]], who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with [[Bryan Adams]]. But like its predecessor, ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called \"Heartaches\". Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US.<ref>The song was later a hit for [[Anne Murray]], from her ''[[Something to Talk About (album)|Something to Talk About]]'' album (1986).</ref> BTO played this song on [[American Bandstand]] in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called \"[[Jamaica (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Jamaica]]\". Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on ''[[Bryan Adams (album)|Bryan Adams]]''' debut album in 1980 as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} (Adams had likewise contributed one song, \"Wastin' Time\", for BTO for the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' album).\n\nOn November 3, 2010, [[Jim Clench]] died in a [[Montreal]] hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.<ref name=\"thestar\">{{cite news|title=April Wine and BTO former bassist Jim Clench dies|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/886479--jim-clench-bassist-with-april-wine-and-bto-dies-at-61|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=TheStar.com|location=Toronto|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|title=CBC News \u2013 Music \u2013 April Wine, BTO musician Jim Clench dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/11/05/jim-clench-obit.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=CBC.ca|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lives Remembered \u2013 Telegraph \u2013 Jim Clench|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8124442/Lives-Remembered.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|title=The Gazette (Montreal) \u2013 Obituaries|url=http://www.legacy.com/can-montreal/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=146420804|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Legacy.com via MontrealGazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979\u20131991===\n\nBTO completed the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' tour in late 1979, and officially disbanded in early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]'' in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived [[Ironhorse]] in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, ''Ironhorse'' and ''Everything Is Grey'', before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as \"Union\", released one album in 1981 entitled ''On Strike''. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy Bachman.\n\nBTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner, joined by former [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] drummer [[Garry Peterson]] and [[Billy Chapman (musician)|Billy Chapman]], their drum tech, on piano & keyboards. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and [[trademark]] disagreements with Randy and the others:\n\n{{quote|When Randy wanted to get back together again, I said, \"Okay, let's have a publishing company with the band. Let's all write the tunes. We'll all share equally and there won't be any more animosity.\" He said no, so I got up and left. Blair wasn't asked to rejoin because Randy knew that Blair wouldn't take any crap like Timmy would. They went out and started to use the name BTO within a year and the same trademark that Randy sold to us! So Blair and I sued him and we won. They had to pay us royalties.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/>}}\n\nIn Randy's 2000 autobiography, ''Takin' Care of Business'', he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.\n\nThe new album, simply (and confusingly) titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|BTO]]'', was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach's new Compleat label. \"For the Weekend\", a song from this album, was released as a single, along with a companion music video, and dented the US charts at No. 83. It was the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and would also be the last.\n\nIn 1986, they released a live album culled from their 1985 tour called ''[[Live Live Live|Live! Live! Live!]]'' which featured two new tracks, \"Bad News Travels Fast\" and \"Fragile Man\". The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of \"Bad News Travels Fast\" was released on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]''. They were the opening band for the new [[Sammy Hagar]]-fronted [[Van Halen]] on their ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred's voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen's management.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing [[softball]] during the group's downtime on the road.\n\nAfter the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see line-ups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman later became the drummer for Randy Bachman's band and drummed on Randy's 1993 solo album Any Road.\n\nIn 1988, the 1974\u201377 ''Not Fragile'' line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song \"[[Wooly Bully]]\", which is only available on the ''[[American Boyfriends]]'' movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on another project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.\n\n===''Trial by Fire'' era (1991\u20132005)===\nRandy Bachman was replaced by [[Randy Murray]] after his last departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman's 1987\u201388 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. ''[[Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest]]'' was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.\n\nThe sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, \"They said, 'We'll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you're not there.' The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It's like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I'm there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they've got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there's this inference that I'm there and I'm not there, which is a disservice to the fans.\"<ref>Interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com/RandyBachmanInterview.html classicbands.com]</ref> Replied brother Robbie, \"Randy Murray doesn't fill anyone's shoes. He brings his own.\"<ref>BTO bio at [http://www.canadianbands.com/BTO.html canadianbands.com].</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] voted to induct Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the ''Not Fragile'' line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as \"BTO\" without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted (the \"classic\" lineup of Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman would eventually be inducted - by astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]] - in 2014).<ref>http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/bachman-turner-overdrive/</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs.<ref>A clip of one song from those recordings, \"Can't Take It with You\", is available along with the interview at [http://www.btorocks.com btorocks.com]</ref> It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the ''Trial by Fire'' CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.\n\n===Hiatus 2005\u20132009===\nSince the last disbandment of the band in 2005, several of their albums have been reissued. The first one to be made available again since the disbandment was ''Freeways'' in 2005, followed by ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II'' in 2006 and ''Four Wheel Drive'' in 2008. ''Brave Belt I'' and ''Brave Belt II'' were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?r=1&EAN=664140644724&ourl=Brave%2DBelt%2DI%2DBrave%2DBelt%2DII%2FBrave%2DBelt |title=Brave Belt I/Brave Belt II, Brave Belt, Music CD - Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rob and Blair have remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob has been rumoured to state he no longer wishes to play in the band and has hung up his drum sticks.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman's shows, the first time they had played on stage together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show \"Randy's Vinyl Tap\", was slated to be the host of a new television show called \"Road to Guitar\", which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.\n\nRandy Murray still plays occasional shows around the Vancouver area. He is the only ''Trial by Fire''\u2013era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.\n\n===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009\u20132018===\n{{further|Bachman & Turner}}\nDue to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009 in their hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nInformation on the 2010 Bachman & Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website ''bachmanandturner.com''. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, \"Rock 'n Roll Is the Only Way Out\". But after hearing the track with Turner's vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.<ref>Bios at [http://www.bachmanandturner.com bachmanandturner.com].</ref><ref>Randy Bachman interview at [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/randy-bachman-0611/ gibson.com]</ref>\n\nOn September 12, 2009, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F. Turner would reunite to play concert dates in Europe, Canada and the US in 2010 backed by Randy's current band of Marc LaFrance, Mick Dalla-Vee and Brent Howard, billed simply as Bachman & Turner. Some early confirmed tour dates announced were June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival and the High Voltage Festival in July 2010 at London UK; the story added that there was also interest from agents as far away as South America and Australia.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Rob |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/bachman-turner-takin-care-of-business-59119202.html |title=Bachman, Turner takin' care of business |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe tour and album plans of 'Bachman & Turner' resulted in a lawsuit by Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton regarding ownership of the band name and related trademarks.<ref>Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] have encountered similar difficulties in relation to the [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] name, which is owned by original bassist [[Jim Kale]], which has resulted in Bachman & Cummings touring since 2005 as simply Bachman-Cummings rather than The Guess Who; see [[The Guess Who]].</ref> Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton claim that US and Canadian rights in the BTO name and trademark were transferred to Rob Bachman, Blair Thornton and Fred Turner when Randy Bachman commenced a solo career in 1977.<ref>Ownership of rights in relation to the name(s) outside of the United States and Canada are uncertain.</ref><ref>It is unclear whether this claim relates to both \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", or solely the latter.</ref> Randy Bachman is said to have registered the names \"Bachman-Turner\", \"BTU\", \"Bachman-Turner United\" and \"Bachman-Turner Union\" in both the United States and Canada.<ref>The current status of European or global ownership of the band name(s) and trademarks is uncertain.</ref> These names are said to cause confusion with the names \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", resulting in potential damages to Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton.<ref>Dan Ferguson, [http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html Battle Over Bachman-Turner Overdrive Name] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109204730/http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html |date=November 9, 2009 }}; Surrey North Delta Leader, November 3, 2009.</ref> There appeared to be general legal agreement that one could perform under one's own legal names such as \"Bachman & Turner\", so the newly reunited pair were billed as such for the 2010 tour and album.  The band played the halftime show at the 2010 [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe rock duo's self-titled album, ''[[Bachman & Turner]]'', was released September 7, 2010 in North America and on September 20, 2010 in Europe.  In November 2010, they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour. A double live album ([[Live at the Roseland Ballroom, NYC]]) was recorded at that show, which was also filmed and will be released on DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. / Line-up:\nRandy Bachman (guitars, vocals); C.F. Turner (bass, vocals); Marc LaFrance (drums, percussion, vocals); Brent Howard Knudsen (guitars, vocals); Mick Dalla-Vee (guitars, vocals).\n\nCapitalizing on the recent Bachman & Turner album and supporting shows, BTO released another compilation set in 2013: ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary]]''.  It has 26 songs on two CDs. Much of the collection had been released before, but there were four previously unreleased songs, including \"Rough Ride\" from the 1984 ''BTO'' reunion album sessions and \"West Coast Turnaround\" from the 1975 ''Head On'' sessions.<ref name=BTO40th>[https://www.discogs.com/Bachman-Turner-Overdrive-40th-Anniversary-Deluxe-Edition/release/10218353 BachmanTurner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary (Deluxe Edition)] Track listing at discogs.com, retrieved January 3, 2019.</ref> The CD set also features one Brave Belt song (\"Never Comin' Home\"), and eight songs on disc two are from the long out-of-print ''[[B.T.O.

Disc two also adds live versions of \"Blue Collar\" and \"Give It Time\", recorded at the same Japan concerts but not released on the vinyl edition.<ref name=BTO40th/> On March 10, 2018, Randy Bachman announced that Fred Turner would be retiring from touring.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\"/>\n\n==Impact and influence==\nBTO has been recognized in many music circles for carrying on the torch of guitar-heavy rock and roll at a time when soft rock was dominating the Top 40 charts, and progressive and glam acts were getting an increasing share of FM radio play. As drummer Rob Bachman put it: \"We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and the funky kinds of rock bands like [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]]. Luckily for us, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|Creedence]] had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner's gruff voice. So it was basically this working man's kind of rock-and-roll.\"\n\nA reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO's legacy:\n\n{{quote|Dave Marsh noted that the band peaked with ''Not Fragile'', an album that \"seemed to exhaust Bachman's imagination; everything before and since is simply sluggish.\" The band's entry in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' acknowledges BTO's limitations, while properly assessing their assets: \"However much it might be open to derision as formula cash-register boogie, BTO's rock is at least dexterously played and arranged, with dynamics reminiscent of mid-period [[Led Zeppelin]].\" For a period during the mid-1970s, BTO enjoyed high sales, steady radio play, and sold out arena shows.<ref name=\"enotesBTO\"/>}}\n\nStated John Einarson, author of the biography ''Randy Bachman: Still Takin' Care of Business'', \"If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] derived his [[Richard Bachman]] pen name from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive when he was listening to the band's song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#1.6\n|title=Stephen King FAQ: 'Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?'\n|author=King, Stephen\n|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Saddlesore Galactica]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRandy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'', making a cameo performing the song \"Taking Care of Business\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-campaign-set-visit/|title=20 Things to Know from THE CAMPAIGN Set Visit|last=Wampler|first=Scott|date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" was also the title of a 1990 [[Taking Care of Business (film)|movie]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[World Series]] and finds the [[Filofax]] of businessman [[Charles Grodin]].

In some teams, the product manager (or [[product owner]] in [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]]), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a [[Product Backlog|product backlog]]. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on [[Persona (user experience)|personas]] or simply made up.\n\n===Common templates===\nUser stories may follow one of several formats or templates.\n\nThe most common is the ''Connextra template'', stated below.<ref>{{Citation|last=Lucassen|first=Garm|title=The Use and Effectiveness of User Stories in Practice|date=2016|work=Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality|volume=9619|pages=205\u2013222|editor-last=Daneva|editor-first=Maya|publisher=Springer International Publishing|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30282-9_14|isbn=978-3-319-30281-2|quote=The most prevalent user story template is the \u2018original\u2019 one proposed by Connextra|last2=Dalpiaz|first2=Fabiano|last3=Werf|first3=Jan Martijn E.

User stories are prioritized by the\ncustomer (or the product owner in [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]]) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken\ndown into tasks and estimated by the developers.  One way of estimating is via a [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|Fibonacci scale]].\n\nWhen user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have\nthe possibility to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be\ndifficult to interpret, may require some background knowledge or the\nrequirements may have changed since the story was written.\n\nUser stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. This can include notes, attachments and acceptance criteria.\n\n=== Acceptance criteria ===\n\nMike Cohn defines acceptance criteria as \"notes about what the story must do in order for the product owner to accept it as complete.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/preview/1691 |title=The Two Ways to Add Detail to User Stories |last=Cohn |first=Mike |website=Mountain Goat Software blog |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> They define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended.\n\nThe appropriate amount of information to be included in the acceptance criteria varies by team, program and project. Some may include 'predecessor criteria', \"The user has already logged in and has already edited his information once\".{{cite quote|date=February 2020}} Some may write the acceptance criteria in typical agile format, [[Given-When-Then]]. Others may simply use bullets points taken from original requirements gathered from customer or stakeholders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn order for a story to be considered done or complete, all acceptance criteria must be met.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nThere is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which is linked to success.<ref>{{Cite book |title=2015 IEEE/ACM 5th International Workshop on the Twin Peaks of Requirements and Architecture |last=Ralph |first=Paul |last2=Mohanani |first2=Rahul |publisher=IEEE |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4673-7100-1 |pages=20\u201323 |chapter=Is Requirements Engineering Inherently Counterproductive? |doi=10.1109/TwinPeaks.2015.12|chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73ea2916b817d44dc5ad95629797fbc7495daa94 }}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nLimitations of user stories include:\n\n* '''Scale-up problem''': User stories written on small physical cards are hard to maintain, difficult to scale to large projects and troublesome for geographically distributed teams.\n* '''Vague, informal and incomplete''': User story cards are regarded as conversation starters. Being informal, they are open to many interpretations. Being brief, they do not state all of the details necessary to implement a feature. Stories are therefore inappropriate for reaching formal agreements or writing legal contracts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ferolen.com/blog/limitations-of-user-stories/ |title=Limitations of user stories |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=Ferolen.com}}</ref>\n* '''Lack of non-functional requirements''': User stories rarely include performance or non-functional requirement details, so non-functional tests (e.g. response time) may be overlooked.\n*'''Don't necessarily represent how technology has to be built:''' Since user stories are often written from the business perspective, once a technical team begins to implement it may find that technical constraints require effort which may be broader than the scope of an individual story. Sometimes splitting stories into smaller ones can help resolve this. Other times, 'technical-only' stories are most appropriate. These 'technical-only' stories may be challenged by the business stakeholders as not delivering value which can be demonstrated to a customer/stakeholders.\n\n== Relationship to epics, themes and initiatives ==\n\nIn many contexts user stories are used and also summarized in groups for semantic and organizational reasons. The different usages depend on the point-of-view, e.g. either looking from a user perspective as product owner in relation to features or a company perspective in relation to task organization.[[File:User Story Map in Action.png|thumbnail|A story map in action, with epics on the top to structure stories |370x370px]]While some suggest to use 'epic' and 'theme' as labels for any thinkable kind of grouping of user stories, organization management tends to use it for strong structuring and uniting work loads. For instance, [[Jira (software)|Jira]] seems to use a [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] organized [[To-do list|to-do-list]], in which they named the first level of to-do-tasks 'user-story', the second level 'epics' ( grouping of user stories ) and the third level 'initiatives' ( grouping of epics ). However, initiatives are not always present in product management development and just add another level of granularity. In Jira, 'themes' exist ( for tracking purposes ) that allow to cross-relate and group items of ''different parts of the fixed hierarchy''.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes |title=Epics, Stories, Themes, and Initiatives |website=Atlassian |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories |title=User Stories |website=Atlassian |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\nIn this usage, Jira, shifts the meaning of themes in an organization perspective: e.g how much time did we spent on developing theme \"xyz\". But another definition of themes is: a set of stories, epics, features etc for a user that forms a ''common semantic unit or goal''. There is probably not a common definition because different approaches exist for different styles of product design and development.

User stories are prioritized by the\ncustomer (or the product owner in [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]]) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken\ndown into tasks and estimated by the developers.  One way of estimating is via a [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|Fibonacci scale]].\n\nWhen user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have\nthe possibility to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be\ndifficult to interpret, may require some background knowledge or the\nrequirements may have changed since the story was written.\n\nUser stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. This can include notes, attachments and acceptance criteria.\n\n=== Acceptance criteria ===\n\nMike Cohn defines acceptance criteria as \"notes about what the story must do in order for the product owner to accept it as complete.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/preview/1691 |title=The Two Ways to Add Detail to User Stories |last=Cohn |first=Mike |website=Mountain Goat Software blog |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> They define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended.\n\nThe appropriate amount of information to be included in the acceptance criteria varies by team, program and project. Some may include 'predecessor criteria', \"The user has already logged in and has already edited his information once\".{{cite quote|date=February 2020}} Some may write the acceptance criteria in typical agile format, [[Given-When-Then]]. Others may simply use bullets points taken from original requirements gathered from customer or stakeholders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn order for a story to be considered done or complete, all acceptance criteria must be met.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nThere is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which is linked to success.<ref>{{Cite book |title=2015 IEEE/ACM 5th International Workshop on the Twin Peaks of Requirements and Architecture |last=Ralph |first=Paul |last2=Mohanani |first2=Rahul |publisher=IEEE |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4673-7100-1 |pages=20\u201323 |chapter=Is Requirements Engineering Inherently Counterproductive? |doi=10.1109/TwinPeaks.2015.12|chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73ea2916b817d44dc5ad95629797fbc7495daa94 }}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nLimitations of user stories include:\n\n* '''Scale-up problem''': User stories written on small physical cards are hard to maintain, difficult to scale to large projects and troublesome for geographically distributed teams.\n* '''Vague, informal and incomplete''': User story cards are regarded as conversation starters. Being informal, they are open to many interpretations. Being brief, they do not state all of the details necessary to implement a feature. Stories are therefore inappropriate for reaching formal agreements or writing legal contracts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ferolen.com/blog/limitations-of-user-stories/ |title=Limitations of user stories |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=Ferolen.com}}</ref>\n* '''Lack of non-functional requirements''': User stories rarely include performance or non-functional requirement details, so non-functional tests (e.g. response time) may be overlooked.\n*'''Don't necessarily represent how technology has to be built:''' Since user stories are often written from the business perspective, once a technical team begins to implement it may find that technical constraints require effort which may be broader than the scope of an individual story. Sometimes splitting stories into smaller ones can help resolve this. Other times, 'technical-only' stories are most appropriate. These 'technical-only' stories may be challenged by the business stakeholders as not delivering value which can be demonstrated to a customer/stakeholders.\n\n== Relationship to epics, themes and initiatives ==\n\nIn many contexts user stories are used and also summarized in groups for semantic and organizational reasons. The different usages depend on the point-of-view, e.g. either looking from a user perspective as product owner in relation to features or a company perspective in relation to task organization.[[File:User Story Map in Action.png|thumbnail|A story map in action, with epics on the top to structure stories |370x370px]]While some suggest to use 'epic' and 'theme' as labels for any thinkable kind of grouping of user stories, organization management tends to use it for strong structuring and uniting work loads. For instance, [[Jira (software)|Jira]] seems to use a [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] organized [[To-do list|to-do-list]], in which they named the first level of to-do-tasks 'user-story', the second level 'epics' ( grouping of user stories ) and the third level 'initiatives' ( grouping of epics ). However, initiatives are not always present in product management development and just add another level of granularity. In Jira, 'themes' exist ( for tracking purposes ) that allow to cross-relate and group items of ''different parts of the fixed hierarchy''.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes |title=Epics, Stories, Themes, and Initiatives |website=Atlassian |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories |title=User Stories |website=Atlassian |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\nIn this usage, Jira, shifts the meaning of themes in an organization perspective: e.g how much time did we spent on developing theme \"xyz\". But another definition of themes is: a set of stories, epics, features etc for a user that forms a ''common semantic unit or goal''. There is probably not a common definition because different approaches exist for different styles of product design and development. In this sense, some also suggest to not use any kind of hard groups and hierarchies.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thedigitalbusinessanalyst.co.uk/epics-stories-themes-and-features-4637712cff5c |title=The Basics: Epics, Stories, Themes & Features |last=Britsch |first=Marcel |date=5 September 2017 |website=The Digital Business Analyst |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/stories-epics-and-themes |title=User Stories, Epics and Themes |last=Cohn |first=Mike |website=Mountain Goat Software |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/march/stories-versus-themes-versus-epics |title=Scrum Alliance Member-Submitted Informational Articles}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://const.fr/blog/agile/scrum-differences-epics-stories-themes-features/ |title=Scrum tips: Differences between epics, stories, themes and features |last=Guay |first=Constantin |date=26 January 2018 |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scrum-academy.de/product-owner/wissen/user-stories-epics-themes/ |title=User Stories, Epics & Themes |date=10 May 2016 |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/you-dont-need-a-complicated-story-hierarchy |title=You Don't Need a Complicated Story Hierarchy |last=Cohn |first=Mike |website=Mountain Goat Software |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Epic'''\n\nLarge stories or multiple user stories that are very closely related are summarized as epics.

Based in [[Ballymena]], [[County Antrim]], the team competes in the [[NIFL Premiership]] and plays [[home]] matches at the [[Ballymena Showgrounds]]. The club is managed by [[David Jeffrey]].\n\nThe club was formed as '''[[Ballymena F.C.|Ballymena]]''' on 7 April 1928, when four local businessmen and football enthusiasts decided that the town of Ballymena needed a senior football team in the Irish League.\n\nNicknamed the 'Braidmen' or 'Sky Blues', latterly because of the colour of the home shirts, Ballymena have a rich history in [[Irish Cup]], having won the competition six times \u2013 the most for a provincial club outside of [[Belfast]] except for [[Glenavon]] and [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]]. The club has never won the league title in its history, but has finished [[runners-up]] on three occasions. The club has also won the [[County Antrim Shield]] on six occasions and the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup]].\n\nThe main club rivals of Ballymena United are local club [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]]. The extremely-hostile annual [[Boxing Day]] fixture between the two teams attracts large crowds and is one of the high-profile fixtures in the Northern Irish football league calendar.\n\n==Club history==\n===Foundation and the War (1934\u20131946)===\nFollowing the demise of [[Ballymena F.C.|Ballymena Football Club]] at the end of the 1933\u201334 season, three men, Simon McCrory, William McNeice and T. Moore, set about forming a new club in Ballymena with a view to seeking admission to the [[Northern Ireland Football League|Irish League]] as Ballymena's replacement. [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] were also applicants for the vacancy, but at the League's [[annual general meeting]] on 20 June 1934, the new club known as Ballymena United was chosen unanimously.<ref>Neil Coleman, ''Ballymena United Football Club: The Official History'' (Donaghadee: Ballyhay Books, 2015), pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\nBallymena United approached the new season with some confidence. The new club took an unprecedented step by appointing a manager which was a departure from the previous practice of team selection by committee. The man in charge was Joe Millar who arrived from Bournemouth & Boscombe and had previously been capped for Ireland, Millar used many of his contacts in Scotland to bring an influx of Scottish players to the Showgrounds. However, despite these new players and an Irish Cup semi-final appearance United suffered in their first season finishing a disappointing tenth in the League, their lowest finish to date. The 1934\u201335 also seen the introduction of the Reserve side at the Showgrounds.\n\nThe 1935\u201336 season was to be just as disheartening for United supporters as the club finished tenth again in the League table, and failed to progress in the majority of the cup competitions. If the previous season was one to forget, any hope that 1936\u201337 would bring any cheer where dashed during the close season with the departure of Jock McNinch to Sligo Rovers. McNinch was leaving the club after 315 games and with him the last remaining link to the 'old' Ballymena side. During the summer his contribution to the club was recognised when the club granted him a testimonial, the first such gesture by United.\n\nBallymena United finished bottom of the Irish League for the first time, after managing only four league wins over the course of the season. An Irish Cup run to the semi-final stage, before elimination to the mighty Belfast Celtic was the only cheer for the Light Blues. They carried this disastrous form into the following season when they suffered a record defeat to Derry City (1\u20139) and losing the next six games before the board appointed Steve Mitchell as player-manager \u2013 he instantly turned things around as Ballymena won 14 of their next 17 games. Unfortunately despite their Championship form they rose from bottom to fifth in the table, only 8 points behind eventual winners Belfast Celtic. The club also made their first appearance in the final of the County Antrim Shield though lost 3\u20132 to Linfield.\n\nThis run of confidence ran all the way through to the following season, as Ballymena United nearly completed an historic double of the Irish League and Irish Cup \u2013 eventually finishing runners-up in both competitions. Finishing an agonising five points behind Belfast Celtic in the league race and a fourth Irish Cup final saw a third defeat to Linfield in the showpiece event, this time a 2\u20130 defeat at Solitude. However, one year on Ballymena United went one better by lifting the 1940 Irish Cup after a 2\u20130 win over Glenavon in which Sclater and Moore. This was the last 'proper' Irish Cup before province wide football was suspended due to World War Two.\nUnited were not to kick a ball in anger again until the 1946\u201347 season. The club withdrew from the Irish League shortly after the end of the season when the Showgrounds was taken over to assist the war effort. One can only wonder this squad of players could have achieved if given another couple of seasons together.\n\n===Post-war United (1946\u20131957)===\nEven though WW2 ended in time for the commencement of the 1945\u201346 season it was not until the following term that Ballymena United made their comeback into the Irish League. Home friendlies early in 1946 were arranged against Belfast Celtic and Linfield but both were cancelled because the Showgrounds complex was not ready following the removal of the troops who were stationed there.\n\nA new manager, Billy Reid, was appointed on 1 May but only lasted until late October, resigning after citing he could not devote enough time to the job and control of team affairs went back to committee. United made their comeback on 17 August 1946 with a 2\u20131 home victory in the Gold Cup against Distillery. The Braidmen joined the Irish Regional League in its final season before the return of the Irish League the following season and finished a respectable sixth in what was a topsy-turvy season which included a semi-final appearance in the Irish Cup. The Sky Blues did suffer their heaviest ever defeat during the Regional League campaign, losing 10\u20131 to Belfast Celtic.\nBallymena United began the 1947\u201348 season with a new manager, Bob McKay, who was promoted from his role last season as chief scout and had previously had been in charge of Dundee United. McKay guided Ballymena United to an impressive third place in the Irish League. Despite a first round exit to Linfield in the Irish Cup, the game attracted a record crowd of 9,067 and was a real end-to-end affair which afterwards saw the transfer of Frankie Houghton to Newcastle United for \u00a36,000 \u2013 which was quite a considerable sum back then.\n\nApril 1948 saw United play their first competitive game outside Northern Ireland when they travelled to Dublin to play Shelbourne in the Inter-City Cup, a game which Ballymena lost 1\u20130 but progressed to the quarter-finals after winning the first leg 4\u20131 \u2013 this set up a clash with Shamrock Rovers who won the tie 8\u20133 on aggregate. The season did not end trophyless as a 2\u20131 victory over Linfield in May 1948 brought the County Antrim Shield to the Ballymena Showgrounds for the first time in the club's history \u2013 that game saw the competitive debut of Eric Trevorrow, a 20-year-old signing from Glasgow junior club, Parkhead Juniors.\n\nThe following season began with much optimism after the success of the previous campaign, this optimism did not last long as Ballymena finished a disappointing tenth in the Irish League and failed to make any headway in any of the cup competitions. This ultimately cost Bob McKay his job in May 1949 during a stormy AGM, as McKay berated the board for interference with his team selections. Norman Kernaghan took over as player-manager and after a moderate first season he finished his second campaign as Irish Cup finalists and County Antrim Shield winners in 1950\u201351 \u2013 beating Cliftonville in the final.\n\nFor the second successive season Ballymena lifted a piece of silverware \u2013 one of only two occasions this has occurred \u2013 as Ballymena United lifted the Festival of Britain Cup after beating Crusaders 3\u20130 in the final in May 1952. The competition took the place of the Ulster Cup for one year as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations to mark the end of the war and the revival of Britain. The Sky Blues finished sixth in the race for the Gibson Cup and defender Eric Trevorrow was given the prestigious honour of being named Ulster Footballer of the Year by the Castlereagh Glentoran Supporters Club.\n\nA third-place finish that season had many believing that United would pick up where they left off, becoming the biggest provincial side in the country; Having been the first team outside Belfast to win the County Antrim Shield. However, a series of poor seasons was stopped in 1951 with the club's second County Antrim Shield \u2013 beating Cliftonville 2\u20130.\n\nDespite the fact that the Irish League had not left Celtic Park between 1936 and 1948; Belfast Celtic were forced to leave the Irish League and Ballymena benefited by grabbing some of their talented players, including a new player-manager Billy McMillan. McMillan was replaced by the experienced Walter Rickett after two seasons. United reached the Irish Cup Final in 1951, only to be beaten by Glentoran 3\u20131 at Windsor Park, with their only goal coming from Currie.\n\nThe following season, Ballymena United won the Festival of Britain Cup, beating Crusaders 3\u20130 at Solitude. The one-off competition was played in 1952 to coincide with the Festival celebrations throughout Great Britain, and the trophy still resides at the Showgrounds.\n\nHowever, after this victory United went through another bleak period in the mid-1950s as United finished bottom of the league twice. In 1955 the club was forced to launch an appeal to clear its mounting debts \u2013 the Ballymena people responded \u2013 debts were paid and a small amount was left over to go into the club's coffers.\n\n===New beginning (1957\u20131969)===\nIn 1957, Scottish born Alex McCrae took over as player-manager of Ballymena United \u2013 he had been a successful inside-forward for Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough in his playing days. He brought instant success to the Braid, as Ballymena finished third and won the Irish Cup in 1957\u201358.\n\nThe 1958 Irish Cup winning team was deemed one of the best Ballymena United teams ever to grace the Showgrounds, as they deservedly beat Jackie Milburn's Linfield in the showpiece final \u2013 with McGhee and Russell scoring the goals in a 2\u20130 win at the Oval in front of 24,000 spectators.\n\nThe next year, with another impressive team marched onto another Irish Cup final (their eighth final); the Sky Blues were expected to beat Glenavon in a Windsor Park final. However United's bad luck struck again as they failed to beat Glenavon, only drawing 1\u20131 and were defeated 2\u20130 in the replay.\n\nFormer Liverpool legend, Geoff Twentyman, then came along as manager and brought the Ulster Cup to the Showgrounds in 1960 with a 3\u20131 win over Glenavon. Barr grabbed two final goals while McKinstry picked up the other. The following season, the Sky Blues were only two points away from winning the Irish League for the first time \u2013 finishing third in 1961\u201362.\n\nTwentyman's success did not continue and he was replaced in time by George Smyth, Dave Hickson, Alex Parker, and Dave Hickson again. Despite this hunt for success manager after manager failed, as the Braidmen constantly finished mid-table in the Irish League, with only one trophy in the 1960s. McCrae was then brought back to end another period of failure at the Warden Street Showgrounds\n\n===The rollercoaster seventies (1970\u20131978)===\nThe Sky Blues reached an Irish Cup Final in 1970 as a mere 12,000, just over half the average Irish Cup final attendance in those days, watched United fall 2\u20131 to Linfield at Solitude. Fleming grabbed an early goal which proved United's un-doing as they then mistakenly tried to sit back and defend out the remainder of the game. Incidentally this was Linfield's last game at Solitude for over a quarter of a century, due to civil unrest. The other interesting point is that it was the first Irish Cup Final with substitutes \u2013 Nicholl filled that role for United.\n\nNext came a colourful time in United's history as one of the most 'colourful' and arguably one of the most talented of United's players \u2013 Sammy Frickelton was appearing at the Showgrounds to the delight of many fans. Scottish born Frickelton was followed by controversy but was still an exciting part of the club's history.\n\nTeenage goalkeeper Jim Platt was transferred to Middlesbrough (where he won 21 caps for Northern Ireland) for \u00a37,000 and Ballymena Council purchased the Showgrounds in two major off the field happenings.\nUnited was now under the charge of Arthur Stewart (as McCrae mysteriously resigned after a board member complained about his wages) as player/manager. United were involved in the incident which led to Derry City's expulsion from the Irish League as their bus was burnt on a visit to the Brandywell during the height of the troubles in the province.\n\nOn the field Jimmy Martin was the major sensation as his goals brought United's best performance in the ill-fated Texaco Cup \u2013 where the Sky Blues lost to Scottish side Airdieonians at the semi-final stage 1972, who went on to lose to Derby County in the final. United picked up the City Cup in 1971 for the only time in their history; Bobby Averill scored the goal as the Sky Blues picked up a long overdue trophy against Ards at the Oval.\n\nIn 1974 that same club beat United in the Irish Cup Final at Windsor Park. John Sloan scored but Ards ran out 2\u20131 winners. However, United won the Gold Cup \u2013 beating Glentoran 3\u20132 with Quentin McFall, Dessie Orr and Jimmy Brown scoring for the Sky Blues for the first and only time in the competition's prestigious history.\n\nUnited then lost the final of the Gold Cup to Coleraine the subsequent year and Arthur Stewart was dismissed after a good service to the club, particularly in the early seasons of his five years in the notoriously unstable Ballymena hotseat.\n\nFormer favourite from the 1958 side Eddie Russell became player-manager and scored as United won the County Antrim Shield for the first time in 25 years \u2013 beating Distillery 4\u20130 at Inver Park. After the burning of the stand and by social club members of the travelling community, the Showgrounds underwent major work and the side was unable to play at the main pitch until the next season. On the pitch too United experienced more problems \u2013 going 13 matches without victory at one stage. Russell was sacked as a result of the team's poor performances and in came Billy Johnston.\n\nUnited lost the 1978 Irish Cup Final 3\u20131 to Linfield at the Oval to complete a league and cup double. This meant though that Ballymena experienced a historic first in qualifying for the European Cup Winners Cup. United entertained top Belgian side SK Beveren, losing 3\u20130 and the score was repeated two weeks later in Antwerp, as the Braidmen fell 6\u20130 on aggregate.\n\n===The glory years (1979\u20131989)===\nDuring the 1978\u201379 season Johnston made way for the arrival of Alan Campbell and he moulded arguably one of the best United teams of recent years, who would constantly challenge for honours and even came second in the Irish League in 1979\u201380. This meant qualification for the UEFA Cup for the first time and a first (and only) win in Europe against East-German outfit FC Vorwaerts, only losing narrowly in the second leg.\n\nOn route to an early season cup game against Ards, manager Alan Campbell was involved in a car accident which meant that managerial duties had to be passed over to his assistant, Ivan Murray, on a caretaker basis as Campbell recovered from his horrific accident.\n\nThe following season seen a remarkable United side finish third and lift both the Irish Cup and the County Antrim Shield in the one campaign. The Irish Cup win over Glenavon was by a single Paul Malone strike at Windsor Park. Former Northern Ireland manager, Nigel Worthington was transferred to Notts County for a club record \u00a3125,000 fee after the Irish Cup win; United had also lost influential midfielder Gerry Mullan to Everton earlier in the season.\nThe reward for the Cup win was a Cup Winners' Cup tie against Italian giants AS Roma, the Sky Blues fought valiantly but succumbed to the relentless pressure of the multimillion-pound side and lost 6\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nIvan Murray took over from Alan Campbell who resigned in January 1982, but failed to reproduce the team's best form and was duly dismissed to be replaced by former Crusaders boss Ian Russell \u2013 who many thought would definitely bring success back to Warden Street.\n\nRussell failed to take the Sky Blues to the next level, despite bringing Northern Ireland goalkeeper Jim Platt back home and also seen the late George Best turn out for the Sky Blues in a Friendly against Scottish side Motherwell. Russell barely lasted six months at the Showgrounds before being sacked by the trigger happy board.\n\nAfter Ian Russell's departure, it was Jim Platt who took over as player-manager at the Showgrounds and United, inspired by Sion Mills teenager Johnny Speak, defeated Carrick Rangers in the Irish Cup Final in 1984. However, after becoming the first United player to win a full International cap since 1933 \u2013 he unceremoniously left to take up the managers role at bitter rivals Coleraine.\n\nAlan Campbell returned for his second spell in June 1984, but left after only one season due to a combination of poor results and the fans treatment of his son; Alan Campbell Jnr. However, in that season Ballymena suffered what the press described as \"One of the most embarrassing results in the club's history\" \u2013 losing in both legs to Maltese minnows \u0126amrun Spartans in the First Round of the Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nSoon after this, tragedy struck the Braid and the Irish League as Brian Crockard, United's outstanding young defender died tragically whilst on holiday, Crockard, a former United player of the year, is still remembered to this day having the player's lounge named after him at the Showgrounds.\n\nJimmy Brown took the reigned from the departed Campbell in May 1985, but despite two full seasons in charge at Warden Street he could not turn the team's fortunes with only a single County Antrim Shield Final appearance to show for his troubles, he resigned in September 1987 after a humiliating defeat to Larne.\n\nIn stepped former Reserve Team boss Alex McKee, with John Garrett as his assistant fired the Sky Blues to the Irish Cup the following season, defeating Larne in a lack-lustre showpiece final in which Paul Hardy proved to be the winner with a cheeky back-heel past Vince Magee in the Larne goal. The reward for the win was a plum tie against Belgian giants RSC Anderlecht \u2013 who proceeded to give United a footballing masterclass the following season, winning 10\u20130 on aggregate\n\n===Barren nineties (1990\u20131999)===\nThe Irish League came up with the idea of promotion and relegation, and decided that they would combine the places of the 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 seasons to form a total score, on which to base a league upon. After a shaky start from Hagan, he was replaced by former Glentoran-boss Tommy Jackson, who fared no better. After a dismal season, he lasted only a couple of months into the following campaign before the axe was wielded yet again by the United board in October 1994.\n\nThe managerial merry-go-round continued when local man Gary Erwin was appointed in October 1994 in a vain attempt to secure a place in the Premier League, despite a famous win against Linfield, he failed miserably and was shown the door in March 1995. Alan Fraser was brought in at the end of the 1994\u201395 season, in order to prepare for the forthcoming First Division campaign. Despite throwing the money about, United finished the following season well behind runaway leaders, Coleraine.\n\n1996\u201397's crop of players finally brought a League Championship to the Ballymena Showgrounds for the first time, albeit the First Division, which Alan Fraser's side impressively won at a canter. This also ensured promotion to the top-flight after two seasons in the First Division as 21 wins from 28 games meant an astounding 15 point gap between United's nearest challengers, Omagh Town, in second place. Fraser's talented side also were close to a 'double' when they cruelly lost the final of the County Antrim Shield to Cliftonville on penalties after being on top for most of the game. The season ended with Dessie Loughery's testimonial against Coleraine at the Showgrounds, which produced a stunning 5\u20131 victory to give the United fans a taste of what to expect the following season.\n\nBallymena United made a blistering start in their first season in the Premier League in 1997\u201398 and looked to be genuine title challengers by Christmas time as they topped the table after a stunning 4\u20133 victory over reigning Champions Crusaders \u2013 which also meant one of the biggest crowds in years at Warden Street for the Boxing Day derby against Coleraine; with an estimated 7,000 strong crowd packing into the Showgrounds. I typical fashion it all went off the rails for Alan Fraser's side as he splashed out a club record fee of \u00a320,000 for Crusaders striker Glenn Hunter but the goals never came and the in-form Barry Patton also saw his goals dry up as Ballymena finished sixth in the table \u2013 missing out on a top half finish on goal difference. The season almost ended in a trophy as they reached the final of the Irish News Cup, a cross-border cup competition for clubs in the North-West \u2013 but lost out to Omagh Town over two legs.\n\nFraser's aging side failed to push on the following season and the money was beginning to dry up restricting suitable replacements being brought in. Failure again to break into the top half of the Premier League table in 1999 was offset by a disappointing non-performance in the Irish Cup semi-final against Portadown, which ironically turned out to be 'final' as Portadown lifted the Irish Cup by default following Cliftonville's dismissal for fielding an ineligible player. Alan Fraser was relieved of his duties for failing to meet the ambitions of the United board just hours after the final League game of the season, which also proved to be long-serving Dessie Loughery's last game as he made a controversial move to Coleraine after 11 years at the Braid. Shay Hamill took charge for the final of the Irish News Cup, but for the second consecutive season Ballymena lost the final this time to Johnny Speak's Finn Harps. The search began for a new manager at Warden Street and a new era awaited.\n\n===The wait goes on (2000\u20132011)===\nFraser's replacement and the man set to lead Ballymena United into the new century was former Glenavon and Bangor manager, Nigel Best who was appointed in May 1999. However, with his predecessor's aging side starting to break up and with little money to finance quality replacements; it was little surprise when Best's team struggled badly during the 1999\u201300 campaign. Striker and talisman Glenn Hunter proved his worth by almost single-handedly keeping the Sky Blues in the division, as United avoided relegation on the final day of the season after defeating [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] at [[Shamrock Park]] to maintain top-flight status amidst wild scenes of jubilation.\n\nMore departures followed the following summer and despite an encouraging start to the 2000\u201301 season, United's frailties caught up with them and Nigel Best was sacked after an unacceptable run of results in December 2000, cumulating with a 5\u20132 defeat to Newry Town. Bizarrely the club appointed unqualified club physiotherapist George Magill was caretaker-manager until a suitable successor to Best could be found; Glenn Hunter, who had taken time out of the game to pursue a fire-fighting career would act as Magill's assistant. In January 2001, former Coleraine manager Kenny Shiels took the reins of the Showgrounds side with the sole aim of keeping the Braidmen in the Premier League. Despite a late flurry in the final weeks of the campaign Ballymena just were not good enough and suffered relegation to the First Division after failing to defeat Portadown at home, when a win would have at least guaranteed another shot at survival in the play-offs.\n\nIt proved a season of rebuilding in the second-tier of Irish League football as the erratic Shiels made a number of 'big-name' signings which all flopped before the eyes of the supporters; former [[Northern Ireland]] goalkeeper [[Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Tommy Wright]], former Leeds United defender Paul Beesley and Liberian striker Leon Browne all failed miserably to make an impact at the Braid. This left Shiels with a number of totally inexperienced teenagers fighting his cause, however despite their best efforts, slumped to a dismal fifth-place finish during the 2001\u201302 season \u2013 Ballymena United's lowest ever placing in their history.\n\nDespite the previous season's disappointment, Shiels' side bounced back with style the following season. Buoyed by the completion of an impressive new 2,000 seated stand at the Showgrounds, the free-scoring Sky Blues were playing an exciting and unstoppable brand of football, however finished the season with little to show for their season as they finished runners-up in the Ulster Cup, County Antrim Shield and First Division. The league campaign was particularly sickening, despite promotion, for Ballymena fans as they were leading the table for many weeks, only to capitulate to Dungannon Swifts during the final run-in. Media attention also circled around starlet striker Shea Campbell who bagged 38 goals and a Northern Ireland Under-21 cap as he was being hawked to moves across the water and also in the Irish League before committing himself to the Sky Blues.\n\nPromotion back to the restricted sixteen team Premier League proved difficult at first for Shiels and his untested side \u2013 however the influence from former Nottingham Forest forward Nigel Jemson proved key to Ballymena's success during the 2003\u201304 campaign as they equalled their best placed finish in the Premier League by finishing sixth and also gaining a return to European competition for the first time in 15 years through the Intertoto Cup. Ballymena travelled to Danish side Odense in June 2004 and produced a remarkable scoreless draw against the full-time side \u2013 only to lose the home second leg heavily with Spanish side Villarreal waiting in the next round.\n\nShiels was given the finance to attempt to bring the Gibson Cup to Mid-Antrim for the first time and signed a number of quality local players in Rory Hamill, Gary Smyth, Gordon Simms and Tim McCann but his team did not produce a return on his investment and eventually cost Shiels his job after four and half seasons at the helm. The final nail in the coffin was the Irish Cup semi-final defeat to minnows Larne at the Oval, as the Braidmen finished a disappointing eighth after a season that had promised so much.\n\nFormer Northern Ireland and Ballymena United goalkeeper Tommy Wright took over as manager on a full-time basis \u2013 a first for the club. Despite a slow start, he stamped his authority on the side bringing a number of new players in including a young Scottish striker Kevin Kelbie, whose goals in the second half of the season almost fired United to their first trophy in 17 years when they agonisingly lost the County Antrim Shield final to Linfield at Seaview. A credible seventh place was reward for Wright's work over the course of the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nThe following year proved disappointing as the club failed to make any progression to becoming a side capable of winning trophies after finishing ninth, the highlight of the season was the visit of English Premier League side Manchester City to Warden Street as part of the transfer deal that took goalkeeper Richard McKinney to England eight years earlier. The next season though saw Wright's side finally come of age as after an incredible 4\u20132 victory at the Oval on New Year's Day 2008 they looked like potential title challengers. This was to be the pinnacle of the success as teenage sensation Johnny Flynn was sold to Blackburn Rovers and Wright was linked with a move to Norwich City. Although the manager signed a new contract in January his team collapsed in their pursuit of success and Wright resigned in April 2008 only to re-emerge at Norwich a few months later. Jim Grattan was appointed caretaker manager briefly before [[Roy Walker (footballer)|Roy Walker]] took charge from 2008 to 2011 when he was sacked after little progress made during his time at the club.\n\n===Glenn Ferguson era (2011\u20132016)===\nFollowing Walker's sacking, United asked permission from [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Lisburn Distillery]] to speak to their first team coach [[Glenn Ferguson]] and they successfully appointed him in June 2011. During Ferguson's tenure they secured their first major trophy in quite a while by winning the [[County Antrim Shield]] and reaching the 2014 [[Irish Cup]] final before losing to [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] by 2\u20131 with the Mid-Ulster side winning their first [[Irish Cup]] in 17 years. The following year, United reached the semi-final of the [[Irish Cup]] before being defeated 3\u20131 by [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] at [[The Oval]]. United started the 2015\u201316 in horrible form. Losing to promoted side [[Carrick Rangers F.C.|Carrick Rangers]] losing 1\u20137 to [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] and being hammered by bitter rivals [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]]. The Sky Blues form picked up, with them beating champions [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] 2\u20130 before beating [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] in the [[County Antrim Shield]] final at [[Windsor Park]]. Ferguson was sacked in 2016 following a concerning slide in form that threatened the club's Premiership status.\n\n===David Jeffrey era (2016\u2013 )===\nFollowing the sacking, the club spoke to legendary former [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] manager and player [[David Jeffrey]] who, going into the interview, had little interest in the job. He found himself very impressed by what the board had to say, though, and decided to take the job, bringing former assistant Brian McLaughlin to the Showgrounds. His debut as manager was a 1\u20131 draw with champions [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] and his team won a series of games before going on a losing run, failing to enter the Europa League Play-Offs following a 0\u20132 defeat to relegation-threatened [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]].\nThe following season, The Sky Blues had a relatively good season, spending a lot of time in the top six and they reached the  [[League Cup]] final against [[Carrick Rangers F.C.|Carrick Rangers]] after beating rivals [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]] 3\u20130 after extra time. They won the league cup against carrick rangers following goals from Allan Jenkins and Conor McCloskey. The 2017/18 season was a relatively average season for the braid men as experienced players brought in to the team during the transfer window did not work out as planned for David Jeffrey and his staff, the club finished the season in 6th place and lost out on a Europa League spot to Cliftonilee in the NIFL play-off system. Following a squad revamp of 9 players coming through the doors in the summer transfer window the sky blues had a fantastic season reaching the league cup final and finishing 2nd in the league.  Between October and December they went on a 19 game unbeaten run.\n\nIn June they defeated Faroese team NSI Runavik at The Showgrounds 2-0 and progressed to the next round after an away scoreless draw. In July they played in the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifying rounds 2019 and were defeated by [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] 7-0 away and 0-4 at The Showgrounds.\n\n==European record==\n{{main|Northern Irish football clubs in European competitions}}\n\n''As of 18 July 2019''\n===Overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Ireland]]. Based in [[Ballymena]], [[County Antrim]], the team competes in the [[NIFL Premiership]] and plays [[home]] matches at the [[Ballymena Showgrounds]]. The club is managed by [[David Jeffrey]].\n\nThe club was formed as '''[[Ballymena F.C.|Ballymena]]''' on 7 April 1928, when four local businessmen and football enthusiasts decided that the town of Ballymena needed a senior football team in the Irish League.\n\nNicknamed the 'Braidmen' or 'Sky Blues', latterly because of the colour of the home shirts, Ballymena have a rich history in [[Irish Cup]], having won the competition six times \u2013 the most for a provincial club outside of [[Belfast]] except for [[Glenavon]] and [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]]. The club has never won the league title in its history, but has finished [[runners-up]] on three occasions. The club has also won the [[County Antrim Shield]] on six occasions and the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup]].\n\nThe main club rivals of Ballymena United are local club [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]]. The extremely-hostile annual [[Boxing Day]] fixture between the two teams attracts large crowds and is one of the high-profile fixtures in the Northern Irish football league calendar.\n\n==Club history==\n===Foundation and the War (1934\u20131946)===\nFollowing the demise of [[Ballymena F.C.|Ballymena Football Club]] at the end of the 1933\u201334 season, three men, Simon McCrory, William McNeice and T. Moore, set about forming a new club in Ballymena with a view to seeking admission to the [[Northern Ireland Football League|Irish League]] as Ballymena's replacement. [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] were also applicants for the vacancy, but at the League's [[annual general meeting]] on 20 June 1934, the new club known as Ballymena United was chosen unanimously.<ref>Neil Coleman, ''Ballymena United Football Club: The Official History'' (Donaghadee: Ballyhay Books, 2015), pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\nBallymena United approached the new season with some confidence. The new club took an unprecedented step by appointing a manager which was a departure from the previous practice of team selection by committee. The man in charge was Joe Millar who arrived from Bournemouth & Boscombe and had previously been capped for Ireland, Millar used many of his contacts in Scotland to bring an influx of Scottish players to the Showgrounds. However, despite these new players and an Irish Cup semi-final appearance United suffered in their first season finishing a disappointing tenth in the League, their lowest finish to date. The 1934\u201335 also seen the introduction of the Reserve side at the Showgrounds.\n\nThe 1935\u201336 season was to be just as disheartening for United supporters as the club finished tenth again in the League table, and failed to progress in the majority of the cup competitions. If the previous season was one to forget, any hope that 1936\u201337 would bring any cheer where dashed during the close season with the departure of Jock McNinch to Sligo Rovers. McNinch was leaving the club after 315 games and with him the last remaining link to the 'old' Ballymena side. During the summer his contribution to the club was recognised when the club granted him a testimonial, the first such gesture by United.\n\nBallymena United finished bottom of the Irish League for the first time, after managing only four league wins over the course of the season. An Irish Cup run to the semi-final stage, before elimination to the mighty Belfast Celtic was the only cheer for the Light Blues. They carried this disastrous form into the following season when they suffered a record defeat to Derry City (1\u20139) and losing the next six games before the board appointed Steve Mitchell as player-manager \u2013 he instantly turned things around as Ballymena won 14 of their next 17 games. Unfortunately despite their Championship form they rose from bottom to fifth in the table, only 8 points behind eventual winners Belfast Celtic. The club also made their first appearance in the final of the County Antrim Shield though lost 3\u20132 to Linfield.\n\nThis run of confidence ran all the way through to the following season, as Ballymena United nearly completed an historic double of the Irish League and Irish Cup \u2013 eventually finishing runners-up in both competitions. Finishing an agonising five points behind Belfast Celtic in the league race and a fourth Irish Cup final saw a third defeat to Linfield in the showpiece event, this time a 2\u20130 defeat at Solitude. However, one year on Ballymena United went one better by lifting the 1940 Irish Cup after a 2\u20130 win over Glenavon in which Sclater and Moore. This was the last 'proper' Irish Cup before province wide football was suspended due to World War Two.\nUnited were not to kick a ball in anger again until the 1946\u201347 season. The club withdrew from the Irish League shortly after the end of the season when the Showgrounds was taken over to assist the war effort. One can only wonder this squad of players could have achieved if given another couple of seasons together.\n\n===Post-war United (1946\u20131957)===\nEven though WW2 ended in time for the commencement of the 1945\u201346 season it was not until the following term that Ballymena United made their comeback into the Irish League. Home friendlies early in 1946 were arranged against Belfast Celtic and Linfield but both were cancelled because the Showgrounds complex was not ready following the removal of the troops who were stationed there.\n\nA new manager, Billy Reid, was appointed on 1 May but only lasted until late October, resigning after citing he could not devote enough time to the job and control of team affairs went back to committee. United made their comeback on 17 August 1946 with a 2\u20131 home victory in the Gold Cup against Distillery. The Braidmen joined the Irish Regional League in its final season before the return of the Irish League the following season and finished a respectable sixth in what was a topsy-turvy season which included a semi-final appearance in the Irish Cup. The Sky Blues did suffer their heaviest ever defeat during the Regional League campaign, losing 10\u20131 to Belfast Celtic.\nBallymena United began the 1947\u201348 season with a new manager, Bob McKay, who was promoted from his role last season as chief scout and had previously had been in charge of Dundee United. McKay guided Ballymena United to an impressive third place in the Irish League. Despite a first round exit to Linfield in the Irish Cup, the game attracted a record crowd of 9,067 and was a real end-to-end affair which afterwards saw the transfer of Frankie Houghton to Newcastle United for \u00a36,000 \u2013 which was quite a considerable sum back then.\n\nApril 1948 saw United play their first competitive game outside Northern Ireland when they travelled to Dublin to play Shelbourne in the Inter-City Cup, a game which Ballymena lost 1\u20130 but progressed to the quarter-finals after winning the first leg 4\u20131 \u2013 this set up a clash with Shamrock Rovers who won the tie 8\u20133 on aggregate. The season did not end trophyless as a 2\u20131 victory over Linfield in May 1948 brought the County Antrim Shield to the Ballymena Showgrounds for the first time in the club's history \u2013 that game saw the competitive debut of Eric Trevorrow, a 20-year-old signing from Glasgow junior club, Parkhead Juniors.\n\nThe following season began with much optimism after the success of the previous campaign, this optimism did not last long as Ballymena finished a disappointing tenth in the Irish League and failed to make any headway in any of the cup competitions. This ultimately cost Bob McKay his job in May 1949 during a stormy AGM, as McKay berated the board for interference with his team selections. Norman Kernaghan took over as player-manager and after a moderate first season he finished his second campaign as Irish Cup finalists and County Antrim Shield winners in 1950\u201351 \u2013 beating Cliftonville in the final.\n\nFor the second successive season Ballymena lifted a piece of silverware \u2013 one of only two occasions this has occurred \u2013 as Ballymena United lifted the Festival of Britain Cup after beating Crusaders 3\u20130 in the final in May 1952. The competition took the place of the Ulster Cup for one year as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations to mark the end of the war and the revival of Britain. The Sky Blues finished sixth in the race for the Gibson Cup and defender Eric Trevorrow was given the prestigious honour of being named Ulster Footballer of the Year by the Castlereagh Glentoran Supporters Club.\n\nA third-place finish that season had many believing that United would pick up where they left off, becoming the biggest provincial side in the country; Having been the first team outside Belfast to win the County Antrim Shield. However, a series of poor seasons was stopped in 1951 with the club's second County Antrim Shield \u2013 beating Cliftonville 2\u20130.\n\nDespite the fact that the Irish League had not left Celtic Park between 1936 and 1948; Belfast Celtic were forced to leave the Irish League and Ballymena benefited by grabbing some of their talented players, including a new player-manager Billy McMillan. McMillan was replaced by the experienced Walter Rickett after two seasons. United reached the Irish Cup Final in 1951, only to be beaten by Glentoran 3\u20131 at Windsor Park, with their only goal coming from Currie.\n\nThe following season, Ballymena United won the Festival of Britain Cup, beating Crusaders 3\u20130 at Solitude. The one-off competition was played in 1952 to coincide with the Festival celebrations throughout Great Britain, and the trophy still resides at the Showgrounds.\n\nHowever, after this victory United went through another bleak period in the mid-1950s as United finished bottom of the league twice. In 1955 the club was forced to launch an appeal to clear its mounting debts \u2013 the Ballymena people responded \u2013 debts were paid and a small amount was left over to go into the club's coffers.\n\n===New beginning (1957\u20131969)===\nIn 1957, Scottish born Alex McCrae took over as player-manager of Ballymena United \u2013 he had been a successful inside-forward for Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough in his playing days. He brought instant success to the Braid, as Ballymena finished third and won the Irish Cup in 1957\u201358.\n\nThe 1958 Irish Cup winning team was deemed one of the best Ballymena United teams ever to grace the Showgrounds, as they deservedly beat Jackie Milburn's Linfield in the showpiece final \u2013 with McGhee and Russell scoring the goals in a 2\u20130 win at the Oval in front of 24,000 spectators.\n\nThe next year, with another impressive team marched onto another Irish Cup final (their eighth final); the Sky Blues were expected to beat Glenavon in a Windsor Park final. However United's bad luck struck again as they failed to beat Glenavon, only drawing 1\u20131 and were defeated 2\u20130 in the replay.\n\nFormer Liverpool legend, Geoff Twentyman, then came along as manager and brought the Ulster Cup to the Showgrounds in 1960 with a 3\u20131 win over Glenavon. Barr grabbed two final goals while McKinstry picked up the other. The following season, the Sky Blues were only two points away from winning the Irish League for the first time \u2013 finishing third in 1961\u201362.\n\nTwentyman's success did not continue and he was replaced in time by George Smyth, Dave Hickson, Alex Parker, and Dave Hickson again. Despite this hunt for success manager after manager failed, as the Braidmen constantly finished mid-table in the Irish League, with only one trophy in the 1960s. McCrae was then brought back to end another period of failure at the Warden Street Showgrounds\n\n===The rollercoaster seventies (1970\u20131978)===\nThe Sky Blues reached an Irish Cup Final in 1970 as a mere 12,000, just over half the average Irish Cup final attendance in those days, watched United fall 2\u20131 to Linfield at Solitude. Fleming grabbed an early goal which proved United's un-doing as they then mistakenly tried to sit back and defend out the remainder of the game. Incidentally this was Linfield's last game at Solitude for over a quarter of a century, due to civil unrest. The other interesting point is that it was the first Irish Cup Final with substitutes \u2013 Nicholl filled that role for United.\n\nNext came a colourful time in United's history as one of the most 'colourful' and arguably one of the most talented of United's players \u2013 Sammy Frickelton was appearing at the Showgrounds to the delight of many fans. Scottish born Frickelton was followed by controversy but was still an exciting part of the club's history.\n\nTeenage goalkeeper Jim Platt was transferred to Middlesbrough (where he won 21 caps for Northern Ireland) for \u00a37,000 and Ballymena Council purchased the Showgrounds in two major off the field happenings.\nUnited was now under the charge of Arthur Stewart (as McCrae mysteriously resigned after a board member complained about his wages) as player/manager. United were involved in the incident which led to Derry City's expulsion from the Irish League as their bus was burnt on a visit to the Brandywell during the height of the troubles in the province.\n\nOn the field Jimmy Martin was the major sensation as his goals brought United's best performance in the ill-fated Texaco Cup \u2013 where the Sky Blues lost to Scottish side Airdieonians at the semi-final stage 1972, who went on to lose to Derby County in the final. United picked up the City Cup in 1971 for the only time in their history; Bobby Averill scored the goal as the Sky Blues picked up a long overdue trophy against Ards at the Oval.\n\nIn 1974 that same club beat United in the Irish Cup Final at Windsor Park. John Sloan scored but Ards ran out 2\u20131 winners. However, United won the Gold Cup \u2013 beating Glentoran 3\u20132 with Quentin McFall, Dessie Orr and Jimmy Brown scoring for the Sky Blues for the first and only time in the competition's prestigious history.\n\nUnited then lost the final of the Gold Cup to Coleraine the subsequent year and Arthur Stewart was dismissed after a good service to the club, particularly in the early seasons of his five years in the notoriously unstable Ballymena hotseat.\n\nFormer favourite from the 1958 side Eddie Russell became player-manager and scored as United won the County Antrim Shield for the first time in 25 years \u2013 beating Distillery 4\u20130 at Inver Park. After the burning of the stand and by social club members of the travelling community, the Showgrounds underwent major work and the side was unable to play at the main pitch until the next season. On the pitch too United experienced more problems \u2013 going 13 matches without victory at one stage. Russell was sacked as a result of the team's poor performances and in came Billy Johnston.\n\nUnited lost the 1978 Irish Cup Final 3\u20131 to Linfield at the Oval to complete a league and cup double. This meant though that Ballymena experienced a historic first in qualifying for the European Cup Winners Cup. United entertained top Belgian side SK Beveren, losing 3\u20130 and the score was repeated two weeks later in Antwerp, as the Braidmen fell 6\u20130 on aggregate.\n\n===The glory years (1979\u20131989)===\nDuring the 1978\u201379 season Johnston made way for the arrival of Alan Campbell and he moulded arguably one of the best United teams of recent years, who would constantly challenge for honours and even came second in the Irish League in 1979\u201380. This meant qualification for the UEFA Cup for the first time and a first (and only) win in Europe against East-German outfit FC Vorwaerts, only losing narrowly in the second leg.\n\nOn route to an early season cup game against Ards, manager Alan Campbell was involved in a car accident which meant that managerial duties had to be passed over to his assistant, Ivan Murray, on a caretaker basis as Campbell recovered from his horrific accident.\n\nThe following season seen a remarkable United side finish third and lift both the Irish Cup and the County Antrim Shield in the one campaign. The Irish Cup win over Glenavon was by a single Paul Malone strike at Windsor Park. Former Northern Ireland manager, Nigel Worthington was transferred to Notts County for a club record \u00a3125,000 fee after the Irish Cup win; United had also lost influential midfielder Gerry Mullan to Everton earlier in the season.\nThe reward for the Cup win was a Cup Winners' Cup tie against Italian giants AS Roma, the Sky Blues fought valiantly but succumbed to the relentless pressure of the multimillion-pound side and lost 6\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nIvan Murray took over from Alan Campbell who resigned in January 1982, but failed to reproduce the team's best form and was duly dismissed to be replaced by former Crusaders boss Ian Russell \u2013 who many thought would definitely bring success back to Warden Street.\n\nRussell failed to take the Sky Blues to the next level, despite bringing Northern Ireland goalkeeper Jim Platt back home and also seen the late George Best turn out for the Sky Blues in a Friendly against Scottish side Motherwell. Russell barely lasted six months at the Showgrounds before being sacked by the trigger happy board.\n\nAfter Ian Russell's departure, it was Jim Platt who took over as player-manager at the Showgrounds and United, inspired by Sion Mills teenager Johnny Speak, defeated Carrick Rangers in the Irish Cup Final in 1984. However, after becoming the first United player to win a full International cap since 1933 \u2013 he unceremoniously left to take up the managers role at bitter rivals Coleraine.\n\nAlan Campbell returned for his second spell in June 1984, but left after only one season due to a combination of poor results and the fans treatment of his son; Alan Campbell Jnr. However, in that season Ballymena suffered what the press described as \"One of the most embarrassing results in the club's history\" \u2013 losing in both legs to Maltese minnows \u0126amrun Spartans in the First Round of the Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nSoon after this, tragedy struck the Braid and the Irish League as Brian Crockard, United's outstanding young defender died tragically whilst on holiday, Crockard, a former United player of the year, is still remembered to this day having the player's lounge named after him at the Showgrounds.\n\nJimmy Brown took the reigned from the departed Campbell in May 1985, but despite two full seasons in charge at Warden Street he could not turn the team's fortunes with only a single County Antrim Shield Final appearance to show for his troubles, he resigned in September 1987 after a humiliating defeat to Larne.\n\nIn stepped former Reserve Team boss Alex McKee, with John Garrett as his assistant fired the Sky Blues to the Irish Cup the following season, defeating Larne in a lack-lustre showpiece final in which Paul Hardy proved to be the winner with a cheeky back-heel past Vince Magee in the Larne goal. The reward for the win was a plum tie against Belgian giants RSC Anderlecht \u2013 who proceeded to give United a footballing masterclass the following season, winning 10\u20130 on aggregate\n\n===Barren nineties (1990\u20131999)===\nThe Irish League came up with the idea of promotion and relegation, and decided that they would combine the places of the 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 seasons to form a total score, on which to base a league upon. After a shaky start from Hagan, he was replaced by former Glentoran-boss Tommy Jackson, who fared no better. After a dismal season, he lasted only a couple of months into the following campaign before the axe was wielded yet again by the United board in October 1994.\n\nThe managerial merry-go-round continued when local man Gary Erwin was appointed in October 1994 in a vain attempt to secure a place in the Premier League, despite a famous win against Linfield, he failed miserably and was shown the door in March 1995. Alan Fraser was brought in at the end of the 1994\u201395 season, in order to prepare for the forthcoming First Division campaign. Despite throwing the money about, United finished the following season well behind runaway leaders, Coleraine.\n\n1996\u201397's crop of players finally brought a League Championship to the Ballymena Showgrounds for the first time, albeit the First Division, which Alan Fraser's side impressively won at a canter. This also ensured promotion to the top-flight after two seasons in the First Division as 21 wins from 28 games meant an astounding 15 point gap between United's nearest challengers, Omagh Town, in second place. Fraser's talented side also were close to a 'double' when they cruelly lost the final of the County Antrim Shield to Cliftonville on penalties after being on top for most of the game. The season ended with Dessie Loughery's testimonial against Coleraine at the Showgrounds, which produced a stunning 5\u20131 victory to give the United fans a taste of what to expect the following season.\n\nBallymena United made a blistering start in their first season in the Premier League in 1997\u201398 and looked to be genuine title challengers by Christmas time as they topped the table after a stunning 4\u20133 victory over reigning Champions Crusaders \u2013 which also meant one of the biggest crowds in years at Warden Street for the Boxing Day derby against Coleraine; with an estimated 7,000 strong crowd packing into the Showgrounds. I typical fashion it all went off the rails for Alan Fraser's side as he splashed out a club record fee of \u00a320,000 for Crusaders striker Glenn Hunter but the goals never came and the in-form Barry Patton also saw his goals dry up as Ballymena finished sixth in the table \u2013 missing out on a top half finish on goal difference. The season almost ended in a trophy as they reached the final of the Irish News Cup, a cross-border cup competition for clubs in the North-West \u2013 but lost out to Omagh Town over two legs.\n\nFraser's aging side failed to push on the following season and the money was beginning to dry up restricting suitable replacements being brought in. Failure again to break into the top half of the Premier League table in 1999 was offset by a disappointing non-performance in the Irish Cup semi-final against Portadown, which ironically turned out to be 'final' as Portadown lifted the Irish Cup by default following Cliftonville's dismissal for fielding an ineligible player. Alan Fraser was relieved of his duties for failing to meet the ambitions of the United board just hours after the final League game of the season, which also proved to be long-serving Dessie Loughery's last game as he made a controversial move to Coleraine after 11 years at the Braid. Shay Hamill took charge for the final of the Irish News Cup, but for the second consecutive season Ballymena lost the final this time to Johnny Speak's Finn Harps. The search began for a new manager at Warden Street and a new era awaited.\n\n===The wait goes on (2000\u20132011)===\nFraser's replacement and the man set to lead Ballymena United into the new century was former Glenavon and Bangor manager, Nigel Best who was appointed in May 1999. However, with his predecessor's aging side starting to break up and with little money to finance quality replacements; it was little surprise when Best's team struggled badly during the 1999\u201300 campaign. Striker and talisman Glenn Hunter proved his worth by almost single-handedly keeping the Sky Blues in the division, as United avoided relegation on the final day of the season after defeating [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] at [[Shamrock Park]] to maintain top-flight status amidst wild scenes of jubilation.\n\nMore departures followed the following summer and despite an encouraging start to the 2000\u201301 season, United's frailties caught up with them and Nigel Best was sacked after an unacceptable run of results in December 2000, cumulating with a 5\u20132 defeat to Newry Town. Bizarrely the club appointed unqualified club physiotherapist George Magill was caretaker-manager until a suitable successor to Best could be found; Glenn Hunter, who had taken time out of the game to pursue a fire-fighting career would act as Magill's assistant. In January 2001, former Coleraine manager Kenny Shiels took the reins of the Showgrounds side with the sole aim of keeping the Braidmen in the Premier League. Despite a late flurry in the final weeks of the campaign Ballymena just were not good enough and suffered relegation to the First Division after failing to defeat Portadown at home, when a win would have at least guaranteed another shot at survival in the play-offs.\n\nIt proved a season of rebuilding in the second-tier of Irish League football as the erratic Shiels made a number of 'big-name' signings which all flopped before the eyes of the supporters; former [[Northern Ireland]] goalkeeper [[Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Tommy Wright]], former Leeds United defender Paul Beesley and Liberian striker Leon Browne all failed miserably to make an impact at the Braid. This left Shiels with a number of totally inexperienced teenagers fighting his cause, however despite their best efforts, slumped to a dismal fifth-place finish during the 2001\u201302 season \u2013 Ballymena United's lowest ever placing in their history.\n\nDespite the previous season's disappointment, Shiels' side bounced back with style the following season. Buoyed by the completion of an impressive new 2,000 seated stand at the Showgrounds, the free-scoring Sky Blues were playing an exciting and unstoppable brand of football, however finished the season with little to show for their season as they finished runners-up in the Ulster Cup, County Antrim Shield and First Division. The league campaign was particularly sickening, despite promotion, for Ballymena fans as they were leading the table for many weeks, only to capitulate to Dungannon Swifts during the final run-in. Media attention also circled around starlet striker Shea Campbell who bagged 38 goals and a Northern Ireland Under-21 cap as he was being hawked to moves across the water and also in the Irish League before committing himself to the Sky Blues.\n\nPromotion back to the restricted sixteen team Premier League proved difficult at first for Shiels and his untested side \u2013 however the influence from former Nottingham Forest forward Nigel Jemson proved key to Ballymena's success during the 2003\u201304 campaign as they equalled their best placed finish in the Premier League by finishing sixth and also gaining a return to European competition for the first time in 15 years through the Intertoto Cup. Ballymena travelled to Danish side Odense in June 2004 and produced a remarkable scoreless draw against the full-time side \u2013 only to lose the home second leg heavily with Spanish side Villarreal waiting in the next round.\n\nShiels was given the finance to attempt to bring the Gibson Cup to Mid-Antrim for the first time and signed a number of quality local players in Rory Hamill, Gary Smyth, Gordon Simms and Tim McCann but his team did not produce a return on his investment and eventually cost Shiels his job after four and half seasons at the helm. The final nail in the coffin was the Irish Cup semi-final defeat to minnows Larne at the Oval, as the Braidmen finished a disappointing eighth after a season that had promised so much.\n\nFormer Northern Ireland and Ballymena United goalkeeper Tommy Wright took over as manager on a full-time basis \u2013 a first for the club. Despite a slow start, he stamped his authority on the side bringing a number of new players in including a young Scottish striker Kevin Kelbie, whose goals in the second half of the season almost fired United to their first trophy in 17 years when they agonisingly lost the County Antrim Shield final to Linfield at Seaview. A credible seventh place was reward for Wright's work over the course of the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nThe following year proved disappointing as the club failed to make any progression to becoming a side capable of winning trophies after finishing ninth, the highlight of the season was the visit of English Premier League side Manchester City to Warden Street as part of the transfer deal that took goalkeeper Richard McKinney to England eight years earlier. The next season though saw Wright's side finally come of age as after an incredible 4\u20132 victory at the Oval on New Year's Day 2008 they looked like potential title challengers. This was to be the pinnacle of the success as teenage sensation Johnny Flynn was sold to Blackburn Rovers and Wright was linked with a move to Norwich City. Although the manager signed a new contract in January his team collapsed in their pursuit of success and Wright resigned in April 2008 only to re-emerge at Norwich a few months later. Jim Grattan was appointed caretaker manager briefly before [[Roy Walker (footballer)|Roy Walker]] took charge from 2008 to 2011 when he was sacked after little progress made during his time at the club.\n\n===Glenn Ferguson era (2011\u20132016)===\nFollowing Walker's sacking, United asked permission from [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Lisburn Distillery]] to speak to their first team coach [[Glenn Ferguson]] and they successfully appointed him in June 2011. During Ferguson's tenure they secured their first major trophy in quite a while by winning the [[County Antrim Shield]] and reaching the 2014 [[Irish Cup]] final before losing to [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] by 2\u20131 with the Mid-Ulster side winning their first [[Irish Cup]] in 17 years. The following year, United reached the semi-final of the [[Irish Cup]] before being defeated 3\u20131 by [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]] at [[The Oval]]. United started the 2015\u201316 in horrible form. Losing to promoted side [[Carrick Rangers F.C.|Carrick Rangers]] losing 1\u20137 to [[Glenavon F.C.|Glenavon]] and being hammered by bitter rivals [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]]. The Sky Blues form picked up, with them beating champions [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] 2\u20130 before beating [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] in the [[County Antrim Shield]] final at [[Windsor Park]]. Ferguson was sacked in 2016 following a concerning slide in form that threatened the club's Premiership status.\n\n===David Jeffrey era (2016\u2013 )===\nFollowing the sacking, the club spoke to legendary former [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] manager and player [[David Jeffrey]] who, going into the interview, had little interest in the job. He found himself very impressed by what the board had to say, though, and decided to take the job, bringing former assistant Brian McLaughlin to the Showgrounds. His debut as manager was a 1\u20131 draw with champions [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] and his team won a series of games before going on a losing run, failing to enter the Europa League Play-Offs following a 0\u20132 defeat to relegation-threatened [[Portadown F.C.|Portadown]].\nThe following season, The Sky Blues had a relatively good season, spending a lot of time in the top six and they reached the  [[League Cup]] final against [[Carrick Rangers F.C.|Carrick Rangers]] after beating rivals [[Coleraine F.C.|Coleraine]] 3\u20130 after extra time. They won the league cup against carrick rangers following goals from Allan Jenkins and Conor McCloskey. The 2017/18 season was a relatively average season for the braid men as experienced players brought in to the team during the transfer window did not work out as planned for David Jeffrey and his staff, the club finished the season in 6th place and lost out on a Europa League spot to Cliftonilee in the NIFL play-off system. Following a squad revamp of 9 players coming through the doors in the summer transfer window the sky blues had a fantastic season reaching the league cup final and finishing 2nd in the league.  Between October and December they went on a 19 game unbeaten run.\n\nIn June they defeated Faroese team NSI Runavik at The Showgrounds 2-0 and progressed to the next round after an away scoreless draw. In July they played in the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifying rounds 2019 and were defeated by [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] 7-0 away and 0-4 at The Showgrounds.\n\n==European record==\n{{main|Northern Irish football clubs in European competitions}}\n\n''As of 18 July 2019''\n===Overview===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
