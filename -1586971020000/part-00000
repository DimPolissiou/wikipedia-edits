All recipients of new or replacement British passports issued in Bermuda, prior to 2002, received this passport, whether they possessed Bermudian status or not. The citizenship of the holder was indicated by rubber stamp in the appropriate field inside the passport. Prior to 1983, the citizenship for British citizens from the United Kingdom or the colonies was ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies''. After 1983, when citizens in the United Kingdom became ''British Citizens'', colonials became ''British Dependent Territories Citizens'' (as this was purely to enable the British Governments immigration authorities to distinguish and discriminate against colonials, this type of British Citizenship did not entitle the holder to right of abode in any British Dependent Territory, including Bermuda. Bermudian status was indicated by the addition of ''(Bermuda)'' after ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' on the rubber stamp), losing the right of abode in the United Kingdom unless already settled in the United Kingdom or having been born in, or having a parent who had been born in, the United Kingdom. Prior to 2002, it was not legal for a person to hold two British passports. A person who possessed both Bermudian status and right of abode (or ''settled'' status) in the United kingdom could have both indicated in the same passport. A ''British citizen'' who did not possess Bermudian status would receive the supposedly ''Bermudian passport'' if obtaining it in Bermuda, with the citizenship stamped as \"British Citizen\" only (unless the holder also possessed status in another territory or held yet another type of British Citizenship). Those who held neither Bermudian status nor the right of abode in the United Kingdom, but who were entitled to a British Passport would also receive the \"Bermudian\" Passport in Bermuda, with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. Before 1983, a Bermudian ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'', and, after 1983, a ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' with Bermudian status who did not possess the right of abode in the United Kingdom, who obtained a British Passport in the United Kingdom, or at a United Kingdom Consulate in a foreign country, received a normal British Passport (not the ''Bermudian'' passport) with the appropriate citizenship rubber stamped inside.\n\nIn 1988, when the blue British Passports were replaced with a burgundy one of a common European Union pattern, the passports issued in the British Dependent Territories were changed accordingly (entitlement to free movement in the European Movement was indicated only on the passports on the United Kingdom type passports, with ''EUROPEAN UNION'' added above ''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND'' on the outside of the front cover (where the ''Bermudian'' passport reads only ''BRITISH PASSPORT'').\n\nIn 2002, ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'' was re-named ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', remaining as the default citizenship for British citizens born in what were at the same time re-designated the ''British Overseas Territories'', and the barriers that had been put in place in 1983 to end free movement of most colonials (excepting Falkland Islanders and later Gibraltarians) into the United Kingdom were removed. British Overseas Territories Citizens were also entitled to obtain ''British Citizenship'' by obtaining a normal British Passport with the citizenship stamped as ''British Citizen''. The restriction against holding more than one British passport was removed. The Department of Immigration was no longer permitted to issue new or replacement passports except for British Overseas Citizenship holders. The citizenship for these was entered only as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen''. Bermudian status was stamped in separately on one of the internal pages. Without the stamp indicating that the passport holder is registered as a Bermudian, a ''Bermudian'' Passport with the citizenship entered as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'' is not sufficient to identify the holder as a Bermudian. The endorsement indicating the holder has Bermudian status can be stamped into any British Passport, with the citizenship entered as either 'British Overseas Territories Citizen'' or 'British Citizen''. As the ''Bermudian'' passport still lacked ''EUROPEAN UNION'' on the front cover, and used the country code ''BMU'' indicated inside instead of the ''GBR'' indicated in the British Citizen/United Kingdom passport, it is not necessarily accepted in other European Union countries as entitling the holder to free movement within the European Union. As a consequence, the only practical reason a Bermudian would obtain the ''Bermudian'' passport, whether in addition or in preference to the normal British passport with Bermudian status stamped inside, was for the purpose of entering the United States of America, which has lower entry restrictions on Bermudians than on other British nationals, but specifies they must present a British Passport with ''Government of Bermuda'' on the front, citizenship entered as either ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' or ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'', and the endorsement stamped to show the holder has been registered as a Bermudian.\n\nSince the HM Passport Office in the UK became the sole issuer of all British passports in 2016, only the normal (UK-type) British Passport is issued, whatever the type of British Citizenship entered. Bermuda Immigration enters the Bermudian status stamp separately (passports applied for in Bermuda can be obtained by handing the application to the Department of Immigration in Bermuda, which forwards the it to HM Passport office and receives it back on behalf of the applicant).\n\n==Application==\n\nAdult applicants can apply for a standard Bermudian [[ePassport]] at a cost of US$160.

All of the islands in the group support vegetation except on their small cays.\n\nThe islands are named after former senior figures in the British [[East India Company]] (EIC). Three were members of the EIC's 'Select Committee' in Canton: James Drummond, Thomas Pattle and John William Roberts. Jonathan Duncan was Governor in Council of Bombay, and [[William Taylor Money]] was Superintendent of the [[Bombay Marine]].\n\n[[Money Island, Paracel Islands|Money Island]] lies at the southwest extremity of the group, and has some small cays on the southern side.

The Portuguese, whose vessels frequented the South China Sea as early as at the beginning of the 16th century, were the first to refer to these islands as 'Ilhas do Pracel' in the 16th century.<br /> Regarding the likely origin of the term ''Paracel'', the word is a variant of the more common form ''pracel'' or ''parcel'', from the {{lang-es|placer}},<ref>[https://archive.org/details/diccionariomart01navagoog <!-- quote=diccionario. --> Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Navarrete, ''Diccionario mar\u00edtimo espa\u00f1ol'', 1831]</ref> which was used by the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] and Spanish navigators to designate shallow sandy seas or [[submerged bank]]s, such as ''[[Placer de los Roques]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dicio.com.br/parcel/|title=Parcel|publisher=}}</ref> \n{{quote|Pracel is a moderately elevated chain of islets, sandbanks, and reefs.

Pracel often forms a natural bulwark as an outer line of defense for a coast or a land.<ref name=\"NDV\" />}}\n\nThe Portuguese were later followed by the Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French in the waters of the island group. On the \"Map of the coast of Tonquin and Cochinchina\", made in 1747 by Pierre d'Hondt, the dangerous band of rugged rocks was labeled \"Le Paracel\", a French phonetic notation. Because of their location on an important seaborne route the Paracel Islands drew much attention from navigators and [[hydrographer]]s in the [[Age of Exploration]]. Disputes in the area since the Second World War have again drawn attention to the islands.\n\nOn the \"Map of Europe, Africa and Asia\" published in 1598 by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen|Cornelis Claesz]], an unnamed band of rocks and sandbanks are shown near the present-day location of the Paracel and Spratly Islands. About two decades later, the names Pracel and Costa de Pracel (Coast of Pracel) appeared on the ''Chart of Asia and eight city maps'' published in 1617 by [[Willem Blaeu|Willem Jansz Blaeu]], a Dutch map maker.

The group measures {{convert|31|by|15|km|0|abbr=on}} east-west and north\u2013south. All of the islands in the group support vegetation except on their small cays.\n\nThe islands are named after former senior figures in the British [[East India Company]] (EIC). Three were members of the EIC's 'Select Committee' in Canton: James Drummond, Thomas Pattle and John William Roberts. Jonathan Duncan was Governor in Council of Bombay, and [[William Taylor Money]] was Superintendent of the [[Bombay Marine]].\n\n[[Money Island, Paracel Islands|Money Island]] lies at the southwest extremity of the group, and has some small cays on the southern side. The Chinese name for Money Island, Jin Yin Dao, is simply the translation of the English name.<br />\nAntelope Reef, submerged at high tide and containing a central lagoon, lies {{convert|2.4|km|1|abbr=on}} east of Money Island.<br />\nNortheast of this are [[Robert Island (Paracel Islands)|Robert Island]] (also named Round Island) and Pattle Island, separated from each other by a {{convert|3.5|km|1|abbr=on}} wide deep channel. A weather station was built on Pattle Island (by the French) in 1932, and a lighthouse and radio station in 1937.<br />\nNortheast of this is Quanfu Dao (\"All Wealth Island\").<br />\nObservation Bank, also named Silver Islet, and the Lesser Silver Islet, are the northernmost of the group and contain a small cay.<br />\nJust south of them are [[Yagong Dao]] (He Duck) and Xianshe Yu (Salty Hut).\n\nAt the eastern side of the group lies a {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long boomerang shaped reef with Stone Islet at its north end and Drummond Island at its south end.\n\nThe Duncan Islands ({{coord|16|27|N|111|43|E}}<ref name=nga/>), consisting of Duncan Island and Palm Island, lie approximately {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Drummond Island and about {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Antelope Reef. Kuangzai Shazhou (Little Basket) lies about halfway between Palm Island and Antelope Reef.\n\n=== Other features ===\nTaking {{coord|16|40|N|112|20|E}} as the centre of the Paracel Islands, then the Amphitrite Group is ENE, and the Crescent Group is West.\n\n====Southeast====\n* [[Bombay Reef]]: This elongated reef is situated at the southeastern corner of the Paracel Islands ({{coord|16|112.5}}) and lies approximately {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the Crescent group. With most parts submerged, the reef measures approximately {{convert|18|by|5|km|0|abbr=on}} (E-W by N-S). Bombay Reef encloses a deep [[lagoon]] with rocks on its edge.\n\n====Eastern sub-group====\n* Bremen Bank: Located {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Bombay Reef ({{coord|16.3|112.5}}), is the southwestern-most feature of this subgroup. This submerged shallow bank measures approximately {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} in length from northeast to southwest. The shallowest area reaches a depth of about {{convert|12|m}} and is located in the southwestern part of the bank.\n* Jehangire Bank: East of the Bremen Bank at {{coord|16.3|112.7}}\n* Neptuna Bank: North of the Bremen Bank at {{coord|16.5|112.5}}\n* Pyramid Rock: NE of the Neptuna Bank at {{coord|16.6|112.6}}\n* Lincoln Island: Surrounded by a coral reef, located {{convert|37|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast from the Amphitrite Group at {{coord|16.7|112.7}}, the island is covered with brushes and fairly high trees, including [[coconut]] [[palm tree]]s. The depth increases sharply on the northern and eastern sides of the island but the southern and south western regions are shallow. An observation post on the western side was found by officers of the German government surveys in 1883. In 1948, Great Britain requested France for permission to use the feature for military exercises.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Northeast====\n* Dido Bank: Separate from, and NE of, the Eastern sub-group at {{coord|16|49|N|112|53|E}}<ref name=nga/>\n\n====(ENE: Ampitrite group)====\n{{coord|16|53|N|112|17|E}}<ref name=nga/>\n\n====Northwest====\n* North Reef: Situated approximately {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}} north from the Crescent group and about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} west-northwest from the Amphitrite group at {{coord|17.1|111.5}},<ref name=nga/> the reef is the most northwesterly feature of the Paracel Islands. Most parts of the reef are submerged. There are rugged rocks are around the edge that are barely above water.

Completely submerged, the elongated ring structure is the largest single reef in the Paracel Islands. The reef has two large, deep openings into the lagoon on its southern side. In the ocean nearby is [[Dragon Hole]]  the deepest known sinkhole in the world.<ref name=\"xinhaunet\"/><ref name=\"washpost\"/>\n* Passu Keah: This small reef encloses a shallow lagoon and is located about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the eastern side of Discovery Reef at {{coord|16.1|111.8}}, approximately {{convert|37|mi|km}} east-northeast from Triton Island. The sand cay measures {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}} in length.\n\n====Outer southwest====\n* [[Triton Island]]: The sand cay supports vegetation and stands on a steep-sided coral reef measuring {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} in length. This southwesternmost island of the Paracels is situated about {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}} from Discovery Reef at {{coord|15.8|111.2}}.\n\n====Central====\n* Vuladdore Reef: Located slightly south of the centre of the group at {{coord|16.3|112}}, this mostly submerged reef is orientated east\u2013west and measures approximately {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Pracel often forms a natural bulwark as an outer line of defense for a coast or a land.<ref name=\"NDV\" />}}\n\nThe Portuguese were later followed by the Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French in the waters of the island group. On the \"Map of the coast of Tonquin and Cochinchina\", made in 1747 by Pierre d'Hondt, the dangerous band of rugged rocks was labeled \"Le Paracel\", a French phonetic notation. Because of their location on an important seaborne route the Paracel Islands drew much attention from navigators and [[hydrographer]]s in the [[Age of Exploration]]. Disputes in the area since the Second World War have again drawn attention to the islands.\n\nOn the \"Map of Europe, Africa and Asia\" published in 1598 by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen|Cornelis Claesz]], an unnamed band of rocks and sandbanks are shown near the present-day location of the Paracel and Spratly Islands.

After the military engagement and the subsequent victory, the PRC gained the entire archipelago and has taken control of Paracel Islands ever since.

He studied architecture at UASD before moving to New York where he graduated from Parsons School of Design and began his career in fashion as Oscar de la Renta\u2019s assistant. He then worked as a designer for the houses of Bill Blass and Eli Tahari before starting his namesake collection in 1998, retailing at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and other better stores around the world. He later returned to Oscar de la Renta as creative director for the O Oscar Collection. In 2000 Sully Bonnelly Accents was launched, an exclusive collection for Home Shopping Network (HSN) and HSN en Espanol, making him the first Latin American designer featured on a shopping network. In 2001 Bonnelly served as Creative Director for Citrine, a contemporary sportswear collection. Two years later the Sully Bonnelly Bridal collection was launched. In 1999 he received the Golden Coast Award, a prestigious fashion award in Chicago. In 2001 was elected member to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) joining an important community of over 300 American fashion and accessory designers. Additionally, he has been honored by several Dominican organizations for his outstanding work in fashion. New York Governor George Pataki honored him in 2005 in celebration of Dominican Heritage Month. Most recently Bonnelly received the Orden al Merito Ciudadano, a recognition given to Dominicans all over the world who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers and done honor to their homeland. Past honorees include: the authors Junot Diaz and Julia Alvarez, the musician Michael Camilo and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Today, Sully Bonnelly is Creative Director for Isaac Mizrahi  Sportswear, Eveningwear and Dresses.

He studied architecture at UASD before moving to New York where he graduated from Parsons School of Design and began his career in fashion as Oscar de la Renta\u2019s assistant. He then worked as a designer for the houses of Bill Blass and Eli Tahari before starting his namesake collection in 1998, retailing at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and other better stores around the world. He later returned to Oscar de la Renta as creative director for the O Oscar Collection. In 2000 Sully Bonnelly Accents was launched, an exclusive collection for Home Shopping Network (HSN) and HSN en Espanol, making him the first Latin American designer featured on a shopping network. In 2001 Bonnelly served as Creative Director for Citrine, a contemporary sportswear collection. Two years later the Sully Bonnelly Bridal collection was launched. In 1999 he received the Golden Coast Award, a prestigious fashion award in Chicago. In 2001 was elected member to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) joining an important community of over 300 American fashion and accessory designers. Additionally, he has been honored by several Dominican organizations for his outstanding work in fashion. New York Governor George Pataki honored him in 2005 in celebration of Dominican Heritage Month. Most recently Bonnelly received the Orden al Merito Ciudadano, a recognition given to Dominicans all over the world who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers and done honor to their homeland. Past honorees include: the authors Junot Diaz and Julia Alvarez, the musician Michael Camilo and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Today, Sully Bonnelly is Creative Director for Isaac Mizrahi  Sportswear, Eveningwear and Dresses. Memories of his travels around the world infuse all his designs, forming his imaginary scrapbook of colors, textures, rhythms and fragrances. These inspirations materialize into exciting designs that instill in women who wear them a feeling of well being and self-confidence.\n\n=== Other notable accomplishments ===\nIn 2001, Bonnelly held the position as Creative Director for Citrine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico Moda |url=http://www.puertoricomoda.com/REVISTA_PR_MODA_Rev6%5B1%5D.pdf |publisher=Puerto Rica Moda |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2002, he designed<ref>{{cite web|title=Museo Celia Cruz|url=http://www.megalatina.fm/eventos/museo-celia-cruz/|publisher=Mega Latina|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> [[Celia Cruz]]'s dress for the [[Latin Grammy Awards]].

All classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. Common pieces of clothing worn by peasants and the working class included plain tunics, cloaks, [[Jacket|jackets]], pants, and shoes. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist or border. Examples of these decorations included, as [[James Planch\u00e9]] states, \u201cgold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=|title=History of British Medieval Costume: From the Earliest Period to the Close of the Eighteenth Century.

It consists of panellists singing the lyrics of one song to the tune of another song, accompanied on the [[piano]].\n\nThe four original panellists were adept at this game, and each took an individual turn. Since the death of [[Willie Rushton]] guest panellists have appeared, and the two team members occasionally sing together, presumably to compensate for the unsteadiness of a guest's voice. Guest panellists sometimes exhibit little or no musical talent - most notably the late [[Jeremy Hardy]], whose dreadful attempts at singing were greatly anticipated by audiences - often to great comedic effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2449984.0.0.php |publisher=[[Sunday Herald]] |title=Arts: Culture: Hardy har har |first=Graeme |last=Virtue |date=04-12-2009}}</ref>\n\nThe panellists also sometimes impersonate a singer associated with one of the songs (usually the tune). In several episodes, [[Graeme Garden]] was given a song with a tune by [[Bob Dylan]] and not only impersonated him, but broke off into a [[harmonica]] solo. Notably \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?|How much is that Doggy in the Window]]\", to \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".\n\nThe game has been played in several Christmas specials (requiring \"One Carol to the Tune of Something Else\" \u2014 in particular, singing \"[[Silent Night]]\" to the tune of \"[[Tequila (Champs song)|Tequila]]\"), and a variant was played in the 2007 special ''Humph In Wonderland'', in which panellists sang a [[Lewis Carroll]] poem to the tune of a song. Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden sang \"[[Jabberwocky]]\" to the tune of \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", and [[Andy Hamilton]] and [[Rob Brydon]] sang \"[[You Are Old, Father William]]\" to the tune of \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\".\n\nOccasionally, some of the panellists imitate backing singers for the panellist actually singing when there is a suitable gap in the song, such as one of the 2009 episodes hosted by [[Jack Dee]], where Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden backed Tim Brooke-Taylor.\n\n==Songs used==\nSome of the humour derives from the incongruity caused by differences between the songs involved. They may differ wildly in [[genre]], structure, [[tempo]], and [[time signature]], but unlikely combinations have sometimes worked surprisingly well. Having the same [[Common metre|metre]] helps. Examples include:\n\n*[[Barry Cryer]] singing \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\" to the [[Barwick Green|theme tune]] from ''[[The Archers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.g0akh.f2s.com/isihac/SeriesInfo.php?series=21#show1|title=ISIHAC Games -

The concept is actually simple, and well described by the game's title, but the chairman claims it to be complex and proceeds to give a long-winded and complicated \"simple\" explanation, which differs each time the game is played. For example:\n\n: \"The game works like this. The teams have in front of them the words but not the music of a song which is different from another song of which they have neither the music nor the words. The tune of this second song, which is quite unlike the first song both in words and music, will be played but without the words to which the teams will substitute the other words they have from the first song which obviously will have no tune because that's made way for the tune from the other song without its words.\n:\n: \"This might be hard to explain, so perhaps this alternative definition will help. Despite the title, each contestant will be allocated two songs, or words sung to music, but from one he will concentrate only on the lyrics while trying to disregard the tune, and from the other he will focus on the music while ignoring the words.\n:\n: \"I know what you are thinking, which one is which? Well the first, or one song, is the set of words sung to music which no longer has the tune, and the second, or another as we know it, is the tune to some words without the lyrics but retaining the music. All you have to do is put them together, in other words &mdash; literally &mdash; one song to the tune of another.\"<ref name=onesong>{{Cite web|url=http://www.g0akh.f2s.com/isihac/One_Song_To_The_Tune_Of_Another_Page.php|title=ISIHAC Games - One Song to the Tune of Another|website=www.g0akh.f2s.com}}</ref>\n\nIn later episodes of ''ISIHAC'', these monologues generally took the form of contorted analogies, ending with an extremely contrived and obvious joke at Colin Sell's expense.  For example, from June 2006:\n\n: \"A song is rather like a microscope. The vertical tube represents the tune, which carries the lenses, or words. These are assembled with precision to enable us to see the object, or hear the song. However, a song can be broken down into its component parts by separating the words from the tune, just as a microscope can have its lenses prised from the tube with pliers.\n\n:Now, I know what you're thinking, teams: wouldn't that be a case of wanton vandalism inflicted on a delicate instrument? ''(pause)''  At the piano, Colin Sell!\"<ref name=onesong/>\n\n[[Internet]]-based fans have taken the silliness a step further, in true ISIHAC style, by playing the game in text-based media, such as [[USENET]] and [[email]]. Liberal use of punctuation can give readers a hint of how the [[metre (music)|metre]] is being applied to the lyrics.\n\n==Similar examples from elsewhere==\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2009}}\nMembers of the [[Barmy Army]], devoted fans of the [[English cricket team]], are known to mock [[Australia]]n cricketers and fans by singing the [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian national anthem]] to the tune of the [[nursery rhyme]] \"[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]\", and vice versa.\n\nThe Australian television comedy programme ''[[The Money or the Gun]]'' featured a different artist performing \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" every week. [[The Beatnix]] performed it to the tune of \"[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]\" and \"[[Twist and Shout]]\". The [[The B-52's|B-52s]] tribute band The Rock Lobsters performed Stairway to the tune of \"[[Rock Lobster]]\". [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator Neil Pepper performed it to the tune of \"[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]\".\n\nThe Australian television comedy programme ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'' features a segment \"Substitute\", where a panelist sings a well-known tune substituting words from an unrelated text (usually a technical text like \"Datsun 180B Service Manual\" or \"2004 Australian Government Tax Pack\"), and the remaining team-mates attempt to guess the name of the song.  The host, [[Adam Hills]] sang the [[Australian National Anthem]] to the tune of the rock and roll classic, \"[[Working Class Man]]\", in one case accompanied by the latter's singer, [[Jimmy Barnes]]. In a 2008 stand up comedy tour, Hills performed the Dutch national anthem \"[[Het Wilhelmus]]\" to the tune of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".\n\nThe [[Scared Weird Little Guys]], an Australian comedy duo, perform a similar vein of songs weekly on ''[[The Cage (radio show)|The Cage]]'', the breakfast show on [[Triple M]] in [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. In their segment, \"Stump the Scardies\", listeners email in suggestions of songs to sing in another tune and the duo get about five minutes preparation time \u2014 usually just enough to find the guitar chords and lyrics online.  This segment occurs weekly at 0845 AEST on Tuesdays.\n\nIn 1989 [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] recorded \"[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]\", the lyrics of \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" (theme from ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') to the music of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\".\n\nA serious example of the principle behind this game was [[Cliff Richard]]'s \"[[Millennium Prayer]]\", in which he sang the [[Lord's Prayer]] to the tune of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" (the ''Clue'' team retaliated in the 1999 Christmas special by performing \"Auld Lang Syne\" to the tune of \"[[Bachelor Boy]]\" and vice versa). Also in recent popular culture [[Mashup (music)|bootlegging]] and [[bastard pop]] have taken this a step further, employing the practice of laying down vocals from one track over the music from another.\n\nBoth \"[[The Star Spangled Banner]]\" and \"[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]\" are examples of taking a song and writing new lyrics for the tune.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:One Song To The Tune Of Another}}\n[[Category:I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]\n", "text_old": "{{Listcruft|date=June 2019}}\n\n'''\"One Song to the Tune of Another\"''' was the first game played on the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[comedy]] [[panel game]] ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' and is still almost always played every other episode.  It consists of panellists singing the lyrics of one song to the tune of another song, accompanied on the [[piano]].\n\nThe four original panellists were adept at this game, and each took an individual turn. Since the death of [[Willie Rushton]] guest panellists have appeared, and the two team members occasionally sing together, presumably to compensate for the unsteadiness of a guest's voice. Guest panellists sometimes exhibit little or no musical talent - most notably the late [[Jeremy Hardy]], whose dreadful attempts at singing were greatly anticipated by audiences - often to great comedic effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2449984.0.0.php |publisher=[[Sunday Herald]] |title=Arts: Culture: Hardy har har |first=Graeme |last=Virtue |date=04-12-2009}}</ref>\n\nThe panellists also sometimes impersonate a singer associated with one of the songs (usually the tune). In several episodes, [[Graeme Garden]] was given a song with a tune by [[Bob Dylan]] and not only impersonated him, but broke off into a [[harmonica]] solo. Notably \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?|How much is that Doggy in the Window]]\", to \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".\n\nThe game has been played in several Christmas specials (requiring \"One Carol to the Tune of Something Else\" \u2014 in particular, singing \"[[Silent Night]]\" to the tune of \"[[Tequila (Champs song)|Tequila]]\"), and a variant was played in the 2007 special ''Humph In Wonderland'', in which panellists sang a [[Lewis Carroll]] poem to the tune of a song. Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden sang \"[[Jabberwocky]]\" to the tune of \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", and [[Andy Hamilton]] and [[Rob Brydon]] sang \"[[You Are Old, Father William]]\" to the tune of \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\".\n\nOccasionally, some of the panellists imitate backing singers for the panellist actually singing when there is a suitable gap in the song, such as one of the 2009 episodes hosted by [[Jack Dee]], where Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden backed Tim Brooke-Taylor.\n\n==Songs used==\nSome of the humour derives from the incongruity caused by differences between the songs involved. They may differ wildly in [[genre]], structure, [[tempo]], and [[time signature]], but unlikely combinations have sometimes worked surprisingly well. Having the same [[Common metre|metre]] helps. Examples include:\n\n*[[Barry Cryer]] singing \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\" to the [[Barwick Green|theme tune]] from ''[[The Archers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.g0akh.f2s.com/isihac/SeriesInfo.php?series=21#show1|title=ISIHAC Games -

The concept is actually simple, and well described by the game's title, but the chairman claims it to be complex and proceeds to give a long-winded and complicated \"simple\" explanation, which differs each time the game is played. For example:\n\n: \"The game works like this. The teams have in front of them the words but not the music of a song which is different from another song of which they have neither the music nor the words. The tune of this second song, which is quite unlike the first song both in words and music, will be played but without the words to which the teams will substitute the other words they have from the first song which obviously will have no tune because that's made way for the tune from the other song without its words.\n:\n: \"This might be hard to explain, so perhaps this alternative definition will help. Despite the title, each contestant will be allocated two songs, or words sung to music, but from one he will concentrate only on the lyrics while trying to disregard the tune, and from the other he will focus on the music while ignoring the words.\n:\n: \"I know what you are thinking, which one is which? Well the first, or one song, is the set of words sung to music which no longer has the tune, and the second, or another as we know it, is the tune to some words without the lyrics but retaining the music. All you have to do is put them together, in other words &mdash; literally &mdash; one song to the tune of another.\"<ref name=onesong>{{Cite web|url=http://www.g0akh.f2s.com/isihac/One_Song_To_The_Tune_Of_Another_Page.php|title=ISIHAC Games - One Song to the Tune of Another|website=www.g0akh.f2s.com}}</ref>\n\nIn later episodes of ''ISIHAC'', these monologues generally took the form of contorted analogies, ending with an extremely contrived and obvious joke at Colin Sell's expense.  For example, from June 2006:\n\n: \"A song is rather like a microscope. The vertical tube represents the tune, which carries the lenses, or words. These are assembled with precision to enable us to see the object, or hear the song. However, a song can be broken down into its component parts by separating the words from the tune, just as a microscope can have its lenses prised from the tube with pliers.\n\n:Now, I know what you're thinking, teams: wouldn't that be a case of wanton vandalism inflicted on a delicate instrument? ''(pause)''  At the piano, Colin Sell!\"<ref name=onesong/>\n\n[[Internet]]-based fans have taken the silliness a step further, in true ISIHAC style, by playing the game in text-based media, such as [[USENET]] and [[email]]. Liberal use of punctuation can give readers a hint of how the [[metre (music)|metre]] is being applied to the lyrics.\n\n==Similar examples from elsewhere==\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2009}}\nMembers of the [[Barmy Army]], devoted fans of the [[English cricket team]], are known to mock [[Australia]]n cricketers and fans by singing the [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian national anthem]] to the tune of the [[nursery rhyme]] \"[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]\", and vice versa.\n\nThe Australian television comedy programme ''[[The Money or the Gun]]'' featured a different artist performing \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" every week. [[The Beatnix]] performed it to the tune of \"[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]\" and \"[[Twist and Shout]]\". The [[The B-52's|B-52s]] tribute band The Rock Lobsters performed Stairway to the tune of \"[[Rock Lobster]]\". [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator Neil Pepper performed it to the tune of \"[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]\".\n\nThe Australian television comedy programme ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'' features a segment \"Substitute\", where a panelist sings a well-known tune substituting words from an unrelated text (usually a technical text like \"Datsun 180B Service Manual\" or \"2004 Australian Government Tax Pack\"), and the remaining team-mates attempt to guess the name of the song.  The host, [[Adam Hills]] sang the [[Australian National Anthem]] to the tune of the rock and roll classic, \"[[Working Class Man]]\", in one case accompanied by the latter's singer, [[Jimmy Barnes]]. In a 2008 stand up comedy tour, Hills performed the Dutch national anthem \"[[Het Wilhelmus]]\" to the tune of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".\n\nThe [[Scared Weird Little Guys]], an Australian comedy duo, perform a similar vein of songs weekly on ''[[The Cage (radio show)|The Cage]]'', the breakfast show on [[Triple M]] in [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. In their segment, \"Stump the Scardies\", listeners email in suggestions of songs to sing in another tune and the duo get about five minutes preparation time \u2014 usually just enough to find the guitar chords and lyrics online.  This segment occurs weekly at 0845 AEST on Tuesdays.\n\nIn 1989 [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] recorded \"[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]\", the lyrics of \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" (theme from ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') to the music of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\".\n\nA serious example of the principle behind this game was [[Cliff Richard]]'s \"[[Millennium Prayer]]\", in which he sang the [[Lord's Prayer]] to the tune of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" (the ''Clue'' team retaliated in the 1999 Christmas special by performing \"Auld Lang Syne\" to the tune of \"[[Bachelor Boy]]\" and vice versa). Also in recent popular culture [[Mashup (music)|bootlegging]] and [[bastard pop]] have taken this a step further, employing the practice of laying down vocals from one track over the music from another.\n\nBoth \"[[The Star Spangled Banner]]\" and \"[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]\" are examples of taking a song and writing new lyrics for the tune.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:One Song To The Tune Of Another}}\n[[Category:I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]\n", "name_user": "Chrism", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSongs used", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Song_to_the_Tune_of_Another"}
