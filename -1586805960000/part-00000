Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in [[Cleveland]] and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer.\n\nAt the time, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]],''<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/anderson-sherwood-1876-1941-sjpc-01/ Anderson, Sherwood (1876\u20131941) | St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary]</ref> which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in [[New Orleans]] during the 1920s, was his only bestseller.\n\n==Early life==\nSherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in [[Camden, Ohio]], a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).<ref name=\"Rideout16\">Rideout (2006), 16</ref> He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (n\u00e9e Smith) and former [[Union Army|Union]] soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries,<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either Irwin<ref>Schevill (1951), 8</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 12</ref> or his brother Benjamin.<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> The Andersons headed north to [[Caledonia, Ohio|Caledonia]] by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]]). Four<ref>Townsend (1987), 3</ref> or five<ref>Rideout (2006), 18</ref> years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories. This period later inspired his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Tar: A Midwest Childhood]]'' (1926).<ref name=\"Rideout20\">Rideout (2006), 20. For connection between ''Tar'' and Caledonia, also see Anderson (1942), 14-16</ref> In Caledonia Anderson's father began drinking excessively, which led to financial difficulties, eventually causing the family to leave the town.<ref name=\"Rideout20\" />\n\nWith each move, Irwin Anderson's prospects dimmed; while in Camden he was the proprietor of a successful shop and could employ an assistant, but by the time the Andersons finally settled down in [[Clyde, Ohio]] in 1884, a frontier town, Irwin could only get work as a hired man to harness manufacturers.<ref>Townsend (1987), 4</ref> That job was short-lived, and for the rest of Sherwood Anderson's childhood, his father barely supported the family as an occasional sign-painter and paperhanger, while his mother took in washing to make ends meet.<ref>Howe (1951), 13-14</ref> Partly as a result of these misfortunes, young Sherwood became adept at finding various odd jobs to help his family, earning the nickname \"Jobby.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 34</ref><ref name=\"Townsend14\">Townsend (1987), 14. The chapter about Anderson's early life is called \"Jobby.\"</ref>\n\nThough he was a decent student, Anderson's attendance at school declined as he began picking up work, and he finally left school for good at age 14 after about nine months of high school.<ref name=\"Howe16\">Howe (1951), 16</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 39</ref> From the time he began to cut school to the time he left town, Anderson worked as a \"...newsboy, errand boy, waterboy, cow-driver, stable groom, and perhaps [[printer's devil]], not to mention assistant to Irwin Anderson, Sign Painter...\"<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> in addition to assembling bicycles for the [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Townsend (1987), 25-26</ref> Even in his teens, Anderson's talent for selling was evident, a talent he would later draw on in a successful career in advertising. As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper.<ref name=\"Townsend14\"/> With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age.\n\nIn addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and the ''Complete Poems'' of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] among them),<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.<ref>Rideout (2006), 37-38. See Anderson (1924), 155-56 for list of authors enjoyed by young Anderson</ref>\n\nBy Anderson's 18th year in 1895, his family was on shaky ground. His father had started to disappear for weeks.<ref>Townsend (1987), 11</ref> Two years earlier, in 1893, Karl, Sherwood's elder brother, had left Clyde for [[Chicago]].<ref>Spanierman Gallery, LLC. [http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography KARL ANDERSON (1874 - 1956)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530064502/http://www.spanierman.com/Anderson,-Karl/bio/thumbs/biography |date=May 30, 2013 }}. Accessed 26 May 2013.</ref> On May 10, 1895, his mother succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]. Sherwood, now essentially on his own, boarded at the Harvey & Yetter's livery stable where he worked as a groom\u2014an experience that would translate into several of his best-known stories.<ref>Townsend (1987), 28</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 59-61</ref> (Irwin Anderson died in 1919 after having been estranged from his son for two decades.)<ref name=\"Townsend30\">Townsend (1987), 30</ref> Two months before his mother's death, in March 1895, Anderson had signed up with the [[Ohio National Guard]] for a five-year hitch<ref>Rideout (2006), 50</ref> while he was going steady with Bertha Baynes, an attractive girl and possibly the inspiration for Helen White in ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'',<ref>Rideout (2006), 47</ref> and he was working a secure job at the bicycle factory. But his mother's death precipitated the young man's leaving Clyde.<ref name=\"Townsend30\"/> He settled in [[Chicago]] around late 1896<ref>Townsend (1987), 31</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 27</ref> or spring/summer 1897, having worked a few small-town factory jobs along the way.<ref>Rideout (2006), 69-71</ref>\n\n==Chicago and war==\nAnderson moved to a boardinghouse in Chicago owned by a former mayor of Clyde. His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]]. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.<ref>Townsend (1987), 33</ref> In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.<ref>Townsend (1987), 34</ref> Money was tight\u2014Anderson earned \"two dollars for a day of ten hours\"\u2014<ref>Anderson (1942), 112</ref> but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]]) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the [[Lewis Institute#Lewis Institute|Lewis Institute]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\">Rideout (2006), 73\u201374</ref> He attended several classes regularly including \"New Business Arithmetic\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.<ref>Townsend (1987), 36</ref> It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on [[Robert Browning]], Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\" /> Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\nAlthough he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.<ref>Townsend (1987), 38</ref> Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.<ref>Rideout (2006), 78</ref> Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to [[Cuba]]. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.<ref>Townsend (1987), 39\u201341</ref> According to Irving Howe, \"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\"<ref>Howe (1951), 29</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.<ref>Townsend (1987), 41</ref> In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in [[Springfield, Ohio]] where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] located on the campus of the [[Wittenberg University]]. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on [[Zionism]] as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.<ref name=\"Howe3132\">Howe (1951), 31\u201332</ref>\n\n==Business, marriage and family==\nDuring his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \"chore boy\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson.<ref name=\"Howe3132\"/> In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk\u2014raising eyebrows among the other boarders\u2014with the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \"first introduced me to fine literature\"<ref>Anderson (1984), 227\u2013228</ref> and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in ''Winesburg, Ohio''.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\">Townsend (1987), 42\u201343</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 226</ref> The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'') and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\"/> Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.<ref>Rideout (2006), 92\u201393</ref>\n\nThough he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).<ref>Daugherty (1948), 31</ref> There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, ''Agricultural Advertising''.<ref>See Rideout (2006), 95\u2013110 &amp; Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively</ref> In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 95</ref> What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] called ''The Reader''.<ref>Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/early.html The Early non-Journal Writings]\". ''The Sherwood Anderson Review'' '''23''' (2).</ref> According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\"Rot and Reason\" and \"Business Types\") Anderson wrote for ''Agricultural Advertising'' exemplified the \"character writing\" (or [[character sketch]]es) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in ''Winesburg, Ohio'' and other works.<ref>Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/wd.html Remembered \"Characters\" in ''Winesburg, Ohio'']\". ''The Winesburg Eagle'' '''23''' (1).</ref>\n[[File:Roof-Fix Advertisement.jpg|thumb|\"Roof-Fix carried us to Elyria\" wrote Sherwood Anderson's wife, Cornelia Lane, of the product her husband started a company to sell.<ref>Rideout(2006), 133</ref>]]\n[[File:Anderson Manufacturing Company Advertisement.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Anderson Manufacturing Co., a company owned by Sherwood Anderson from 1907\u20131913, almost a decade before he became a well-known author]]\nPart of Anderson's job in those early years of his career was making trips to solicit potential clients. On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \"Jennie\" Bemis, then living in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877\u20131967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in [[Lucas, Ohio]].<ref>Ohio,\n County Marriages, 1774-1993</ref> They would go on to have three children\u2014Robert Lane (1907\u20131951), John Sherwood (1908\u20131995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911\u20131996).<ref>Rideout (2006), 112\u2013114</ref> After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].<ref>A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the ''[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/98summer.html Sherwood Anderson Review]'' (Summer 1998)</ref> For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on [[Labor Day]] 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.<ref>Rideout (2006), 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nWhile his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressful<ref name=\":0\">Townsend (1987), 59\u201360</ref> the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 45</ref> Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective [[Incubators (egg)|incubators]]. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 126\u2013128</ref>\n\nHis failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \"Roof-Fix.\"<ref>Daugherty (1948), 33</ref> The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.<ref>Howe (1951), 41\u201342</ref> So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 134</ref> Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \"Commercial Democracy.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 137\u2013138</ref><ref>Sutton (1967), 9\u201312</ref>\n\n==Nervous breakdown==\nIt was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \"myth\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 55</ref> or \"legend\"<ref name=\"Howe49\">Howe (1951), 49</ref><ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\">White (1972), xii\u2013xiv</ref> of Sherwood Anderson's life.<ref>Rideout (2006), 149\u2013155</ref>\n\nOn Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\"<ref group=\"note\">The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\"</ref> and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.<ref>Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155\u2013156; Schevill (1951), 52\u201359; Townsend (1987), 76\u201382.</ref>\n\nBut even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the ''Elyria Evening Telegram'' and the ''Cleveland Press'' following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \"overwork\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,<ref>See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter</ref> on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The ''Evening Telegram'' reported (possibly spuriously)<ref>Sutton (1967), 43\u201344</ref> that \"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\"<ref>''Elyria Evening Telegram''(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59</ref> This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs'' (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\"<ref>Anderson (1942), 194</ref> This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.<ref name=\"Howe49\"/><ref>Sutton (1967), 12</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 157</ref> In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory.<ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\"/> Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.<ref>Sutton (1967), 36\u201339 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections.</ref> While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \"[[amnesia]]\" to \"lost identity\" to \"[[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]],\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \"[[fugue state]].\"<ref>Townsend (1987), 81</ref><ref>Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue-literature]\" ''Psychiatric Times''.

Later, he married his mistress, the sculptor [[Tennessee Claflin Mitchell]] (1874\u20131929).<ref>Bassett (2005), p. 21</ref> Anderson divorced Mitchell in 1924 in [[Reno, Nevada]], and soon the same year married his third wife, Elizabeth Prall, a woman he was already involved with before the divorce.<ref>Anderson, Elizabeth and Gerald R. Kelly (1969). ''Miss Elizabeth''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.</ref>\n\n==Novelist==\nAnderson's first novel, ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]'', was published in 1916 as part of a three-book deal with [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]]. This book, along with his second novel, ''[[Marching Men]]'' (1917), are usually considered his \"apprentice novels\" because they came before Anderson found fame with ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919) and are generally considered inferior in quality to works that followed.<ref>Howe (1951), 91</ref>\n\nAnderson's most notable work is his collection of interrelated short stories, ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919). In his memoir, he wrote that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote.<ref>Anderson, Sherwood. ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1942.</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Instead of emphasizing plot and action, Anderson used a simple, precise, unsentimental style to reveal the frustration, loneliness, and longing in the lives of his characters. These characters are stunted by the narrowness of Midwestern small-town life and by their own limitations.\"<ref name=\"fogel\"/></blockquote>In addition, Anderson was one of the first American novelists to introduce new insights from psychology, including [[Freudian analysis]].<ref name=\"fogel\">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/anderson.html Daniel Mark Fogel,\"Sherwood Anderson\"], ''The American Novel,'' PBS, 2007, accessed 2 June 2013</ref>\n\nAlthough his short stories were very successful, Anderson wanted to write novels, which he felt allowed a larger scale. In 1920, he published ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'', which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published ''[[Many Marriages]]''; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in ''Dark Laughter'' and later writing.<ref name=\"nona\"/> ''Dark Laughter'' had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] considered ''Many Marriages'' to be Anderson's finest novel.<ref>Howe, Irving. ''Sherwood Anderson''. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254)</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to [[New Orleans]], where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the heart of the [[French Quarter]]. For a time, they entertained [[William Faulkner]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works.<ref name=\"fogel\"/>\n\nAnderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \"A Meeting South.\" His novel ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'', it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime.\n\n==Four marriages==\nAnderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |title=Sherwood Anderson's Biography |url=http://umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/anderson/biography.htm |website=umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>.  \n\nAnderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1924.\n\nThat year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884\u20131976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with [[Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver]] (1896\u20131985).\n\nIn 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.<ref>Anderson (1991), pp. 8\u20139</ref> They traveled and often studied together. They were both active in the [[trade union]] movement.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/G-0005/excerpts/excerpt_2841.html ''Documenting the American South:'' Oral Histories of the American South], University of North Carolina</ref> Anderson also became close to Copenhaver's mother, [[Laura Copenhaver|Laura]].<ref name=\"virginia.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2007/copenhaver.htm|title=Virginia Women in History 2007: Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Later work==\nAnderson frequently contributed articles to newspapers. In 1935, he was commissioned to go to [[Franklin County, Virginia]] to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \"The Great [[Moonshine]] Conspiracy\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \"wettest county in the world,\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by [[Matt Bondurant]].<ref name =LJ>{{cite journal| last = Fisher| first = Ann H.| title = The Wettest Country in the World [Review]| journal = Library Journal| date = 7/1/2008| volume = 133| issue = 12| page = 58}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, Anderson published ''[[Death in the Woods]]'' ([[Short story|short stories]]), ''Puzzled America'' (essays), and ''Kit Brandon: A Portrait'' (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel ''Beyond Desire'' to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones.\n\n''Beyond Desire'' built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia.\n\nIn his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his [[Ripshin Farm]] in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|title=Ripshin Farm|accessdate=2008-04-16|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154607/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.<ref>''Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper'', edited by Ray Lewis White (1967)</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Sherwood Anderson's grave marker.jpg|thumb|Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia.

Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in [[Cleveland]] and [[Elyria, Ohio]]. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer.\n\nAt the time, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]],''<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/anderson-sherwood-1876-1941-sjpc-01/ Anderson, Sherwood (1876\u20131941) | St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary]</ref> which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in [[New Orleans]] during the 1920s, was his only bestseller.\n\n==Early life==\nSherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in [[Camden, Ohio]], a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).<ref name=\"Rideout16\">Rideout (2006), 16</ref> He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (n\u00e9e Smith) and former [[Union Army|Union]] soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries,<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either Irwin<ref>Schevill (1951), 8</ref><ref>Howe (1951), 12</ref> or his brother Benjamin.<ref name=\"Rideout16\" /> The Andersons headed north to [[Caledonia, Ohio|Caledonia]] by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now [[Butler, Ohio|Butler]]). Four<ref>Townsend (1987), 3</ref> or five<ref>Rideout (2006), 18</ref> years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories.

As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper.<ref name=\"Townsend14\"/> With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age.\n\nIn addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and the ''Complete Poems'' of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] among them),<ref name=\"Howe16\"/> the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.<ref>Rideout (2006), 37-38.

His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]]. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.<ref>Townsend (1987), 33</ref> In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.<ref>Townsend (1987), 34</ref> Money was tight\u2014Anderson earned \"two dollars for a day of ten hours\"\u2014<ref>Anderson (1942), 112</ref> but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]]) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the [[Lewis Institute#Lewis Institute|Lewis Institute]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\">Rideout (2006), 73\u201374</ref> He attended several classes regularly including \"New Business Arithmetic\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.<ref>Townsend (1987), 36</ref> It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on [[Robert Browning]], Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"Rideout7374\" /> Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\nAlthough he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.<ref>Townsend (1987), 38</ref> Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.<ref>Rideout (2006), 78</ref> Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to [[Cuba]]. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.<ref>Townsend (1987), 39\u201341</ref> According to Irving Howe, \"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\"<ref>Howe (1951), 29</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.<ref>Townsend (1987), 41</ref> In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in [[Springfield, Ohio]] where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] located on the campus of the [[Wittenberg University]]. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on [[Zionism]] as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.<ref name=\"Howe3132\">Howe (1951), 31\u201332</ref>\n\n==Business, marriage and family==\nDuring his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \"chore boy\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson.<ref name=\"Howe3132\"/> In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk\u2014raising eyebrows among the other boarders\u2014with the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \"first introduced me to fine literature\"<ref>Anderson (1984), 227\u2013228</ref> and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in ''Winesburg, Ohio''.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\">Townsend (1987), 42\u201343</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 226</ref> The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'') and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office.<ref name=\"Townsend4243\"/> Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.<ref>Rideout (2006), 92\u201393</ref>\n\nThough he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).<ref>Daugherty (1948), 31</ref> There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, ''Agricultural Advertising''.<ref>See Rideout (2006), 95\u2013110 &amp; Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively</ref> In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 95</ref> What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] called ''The Reader''.<ref>Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/early.html The Early non-Journal Writings]\". ''The Sherwood Anderson Review'' '''23''' (2).</ref> According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\"Rot and Reason\" and \"Business Types\") Anderson wrote for ''Agricultural Advertising'' exemplified the \"character writing\" (or [[character sketch]]es) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in ''Winesburg, Ohio'' and other works.<ref>Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \"[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/wd.html Remembered \"Characters\" in ''Winesburg, Ohio'']\".

On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \"Jennie\" Bemis, then living in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877\u20131967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in [[Lucas, Ohio]].<ref>Ohio,\n County Marriages, 1774-1993</ref> They would go on to have three children\u2014Robert Lane (1907\u20131951), John Sherwood (1908\u20131995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911\u20131996).<ref>Rideout (2006), 112\u2013114</ref> After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the [[South Side, Chicago|south side of Chicago]].<ref>A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the ''[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~mspear/98summer.html Sherwood Anderson Review]'' (Summer 1998)</ref> For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on [[Labor Day]] 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.<ref>Rideout (2006), 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nWhile his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressful<ref name=\":0\">Townsend (1987), 59\u201360</ref> the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 45</ref> Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective [[Incubators (egg)|incubators]]. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 126\u2013128</ref>\n\nHis failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \"Roof-Fix.\"<ref>Daugherty (1948), 33</ref> The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.<ref>Howe (1951), 41\u201342</ref> So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.<ref>Rideout (2006), 134</ref> Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \"Commercial Democracy.\"<ref>Rideout (2006), 137\u2013138</ref><ref>Sutton (1967), 9\u201312</ref>\n\n==Nervous breakdown==\nIt was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \"myth\"<ref>Schevill (1951), 55</ref> or \"legend\"<ref name=\"Howe49\">Howe (1951), 49</ref><ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\">White (1972), xii\u2013xiv</ref> of Sherwood Anderson's life.<ref>Rideout (2006), 149\u2013155</ref>\n\nOn Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\"<ref group=\"note\">The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\"</ref> and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.<ref>Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155\u2013156; Schevill (1951), 52\u201359; Townsend (1987), 76\u201382.</ref>\n\nBut even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the ''Elyria Evening Telegram'' and the ''Cleveland Press'' following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \"overwork\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,<ref>See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter</ref> on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The ''Evening Telegram'' reported (possibly spuriously)<ref>Sutton (1967), 43\u201344</ref> that \"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\"<ref>''Elyria Evening Telegram''(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59</ref> This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs'' (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\"<ref>Anderson (1942), 194</ref> This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.<ref name=\"Howe49\"/><ref>Sutton (1967), 12</ref><ref>Rideout (2006), 157</ref> In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory.<ref name=\"White1972xiixiv\"/> Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.<ref>Sutton (1967), 36\u201339 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections.</ref> While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \"[[amnesia]]\" to \"lost identity\" to \"[[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]],\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \"[[fugue state]].\"<ref>Townsend (1987), 81</ref><ref>Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue-literature]\" ''Psychiatric Times''.

Kelly (1969). ''Miss Elizabeth''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.</ref>\n\n==Novelist==\nAnderson's first novel, ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]'', was published in 1916 as part of a three-book deal with [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]]. This book, along with his second novel, ''[[Marching Men]]'' (1917), are usually considered his \"apprentice novels\" because they came before Anderson found fame with ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919) and are generally considered inferior in quality to works that followed.<ref>Howe (1951), 91</ref>\n\nAnderson's most notable work is his collection of interrelated short stories, ''Winesburg, Ohio'' (1919). In his memoir, he wrote that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote.<ref>Anderson, Sherwood. ''Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1942.</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Instead of emphasizing plot and action, Anderson used a simple, precise, unsentimental style to reveal the frustration, loneliness, and longing in the lives of his characters. These characters are stunted by the narrowness of Midwestern small-town life and by their own limitations.\"<ref name=\"fogel\"/></blockquote>In addition, Anderson was one of the first American novelists to introduce new insights from psychology, including [[Freudian analysis]].<ref name=\"fogel\">[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/anderson.html Daniel Mark Fogel,\"Sherwood Anderson\"], ''The American Novel,'' PBS, 2007, accessed 2 June 2013</ref>\n\nAlthough his short stories were very successful, Anderson wanted to write novels, which he felt allowed a larger scale. In 1920, he published ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'', which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published ''[[Many Marriages]]''; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in ''Dark Laughter'' and later writing.<ref name=\"nona\"/> ''Dark Laughter'' had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] considered ''Many Marriages'' to be Anderson's finest novel.<ref>Howe, Irving. ''Sherwood Anderson''. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254)</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to [[New Orleans]], where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] in the heart of the [[French Quarter]]. For a time, they entertained [[William Faulkner]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Edmund Wilson]] and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works.<ref name=\"fogel\"/>\n\nAnderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \"A Meeting South.\" His novel ''[[Dark Laughter]]'' (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his novella ''[[The Torrents of Spring]]'', it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime.\n\n==Four marriages==\nAnderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |title=Sherwood Anderson's Biography |url=http://umich.edu/~eng217/student_projects/anderson/biography.htm |website=umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>.  \n\nAnderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1924.\n\nThat year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884\u20131976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with [[Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver]] (1896\u20131985).\n\nIn 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.<ref>Anderson (1991), pp. 8\u20139</ref> They traveled and often studied together. They were both active in the [[trade union]] movement.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/G-0005/excerpts/excerpt_2841.html ''Documenting the American South:'' Oral Histories of the American South], University of North Carolina</ref> Anderson also became close to Copenhaver's mother, [[Laura Copenhaver|Laura]].<ref name=\"virginia.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2007/copenhaver.htm|title=Virginia Women in History 2007: Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Later work==\nAnderson frequently contributed articles to newspapers. In 1935, he was commissioned to go to [[Franklin County, Virginia]] to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \"The Great [[Moonshine]] Conspiracy\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \"wettest county in the world,\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by [[Matt Bondurant]].<ref name =LJ>{{cite journal| last = Fisher| first = Ann H.| title = The Wettest Country in the World [Review]| journal = Library Journal| date = 7/1/2008| volume = 133| issue = 12| page = 58}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, Anderson published ''[[Death in the Woods]]'' ([[Short story|short stories]]), ''Puzzled America'' (essays), and ''Kit Brandon: A Portrait'' (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel ''Beyond Desire'' to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones.\n\n''Beyond Desire'' built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 [[Loray Mill Strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, ''[[To Have and Have Not]]'' (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia.\n\nIn his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his [[Ripshin Farm]] in [[Troutdale, Virginia]], which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|title=Ripshin Farm|accessdate=2008-04-16|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154607/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1165&ResourceType=Building|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.<ref>''Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper'', edited by Ray Lewis White (1967)</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Sherwood Anderson's grave marker.jpg|thumb|Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia.

She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.\n\nLiara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].\n\nLiara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' squadmates, has been released.\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I think, especially in Mass Effect 1 before she started to evolve, that almost everything was a discovery but especially in her relationships. She was always the scientist and always absorbing and even though she was deeply emotional she was observant and very reactionary in the way she went about things. I felt that her eyes were always looking, her ears were always listening and she was very aware and almost child-like even though she was 106 years old.\"\n |source = \u2014 Ali Hillis, in an interview with ''The Gaming Liberty''<ref name=\"Interview1\"/>}}\n\nLiara's species, the asari were the first to discover the Citadel and proposed the creation of a Council after they made first contact with the salarians.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> As part of the Council, they serve as its \"mediators and centrists\".<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> The asari have the largest economy of all the races.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Alien races\"/> The asari are perceived to have a \"[[Femininity|feminine]]\" appearance by non-asari standards. Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>\n\nThe asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.\n\nAsari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>\n\nHillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure.

Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.\n\nOn her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nLiara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. \n\nLiara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".\n\n====Mass Effect 3====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}\nLiara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.\n\nAfter the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\nIf the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.\n\nDuring the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.\n\n====Mass Effect: Andromeda====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}\nLiara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.\n\n===In other media===\n====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}\nThe narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====\nLiara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nLiara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.\n\nAt the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.\n\nAs Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.

She is an asari, a [[non-binary gender]]ed sapient [[homeothermy|homeotherm]] species with a [[pansexuality|pansexual]]-[[romantic orientation|panromantic]] orientation and are naturally inclined towards biotics<ref name=\"Alien races\"/>, the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain\", allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> Liara is noted for being the galactic community's foremost expert in the field of Prothean archaeology and technology, specifically evidence concerning the demise of the ancient Protheans, believed by the galactic community to be the pre-eminent civilization in the Milky Way galaxy until their sudden disappearance fifty thousands years before the events of the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.\n\nLiara is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in the video games. Outside of the trilogy, Liara appears as the protagonist in the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' series, and the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', a comic series with individual issues on each of several ''Mass Effect 3'' squad mates prior to the Reaper invasion. Liara also has cameo appearances in ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', and in the animated feature film, ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]'', where she is voiced by [[Jamie Marchi]].\n\nLiara has been received positively, with placements on several \"top character\" critic and fan lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series, particularly for fan art and [[cosplay]] activities.<ref name=\"Cosplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-this-great-liara-mass-effect-cosplay/|title=Check out this great Liara Mass Effect cosplay|author=Jody Macgregor|date=September 2, 2018 |publisher=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> She was the subject of some controversy in 2007 following the release of the original ''Mass Effect'', after certain media outlets reported allegations of obscenity in the sex scenes between Shepard and their squad mates, and at least one case of government scrutiny over Liara's intimate scene with a female Shepard.

Most asari choose to use [[She (pronoun)|feminine third-person, singular personal pronouns]] as an efficient means of conversing with non-asari on terms they could understand.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> However, Liara has on at least one occasion responded to perceived [[gender bias]] and denied that she is a \"woman\", noting that her species has \"one\" gender and that the concept of [[gender binary|gender binarism]] is meaningless to the asari.<ref name=\"Gender\"/>\n\nThe asari are capable of procreating with any sentient life form, and can reproduce with any known sex, gender or species&mdash;their offspring are always asari, regardless of the species of their \"father\", which has led to in-universe claims of asari promiscuity.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/><ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Instead of trading cellular material directly like other biological organisms, asari reproduce by \"melding\": linking their nervous systems with their partner's using their biotic abilities and utilizing the electrical pattern of their partners nerve's to provide a template for half the DNA of their resulting child. <ref name=\"polygon lore\"/> Liara is the offspring of Matriarch Aethyta and Matriarch Benezia, and is \"one-quarter krogan\" on Aethyta's side. Matriarch Aethyta is first encountered in ''Mass Effect 2'' as a bartender in Illium, where Lara was based as an information broker. She later moves on to tend a bar at the Presidium in ''Mass Effect 3'', where she is revealed as Liara's other biological parent and had been spying on her all along. As a \"pureblood\", a term often used as a cruel insult for children born of two asari, Liara grew up being [[Social exclusion|socially stigmatized]] by asari society. If Shepard discusses her parentage in the original ''Mass Effect'', Liara would speculate that her parents were possibly embarrassed by the union as the asari believe that for them to improve themselves, they should mate with other species to gain new genetic properties.\n\nAsari can live for over a thousand years<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>, and go through three stages of life: the Maiden stage, where they explore the world out of curiosity and restlessness, with many trying their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time; the Matron stage, where they begin to feel the desire to settle down to raise children; and finally the Matriarch stage, where they are often elevated as leaders of their communities, dispensing wisdom from centuries of life experience.<ref name=\"Asari Codex\"/> Their long lifespan makes them more comfortable with observation.<ref name=\"Alien races\"/> Liara is 106 years old during her first appearance, which is the equivalent to a human teenager and within the Maiden stage of asari life. While she is legally [[age of majority]] under Citadel law, she is not considered to have reached [[adult]]hood by asari standards. In spite of her culturally young age, she is depicted in the series as possessing the skills and experience of a [[computer scientist]], [[xenoarchaeology|xenoarchaeologist]], [[philology|philologist]], and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]].<ref name=\"RollingStones\"/>\n\nHillis liked Liara's selflessness in the first game, commenting in a 2014 interview, \"She is so pure. There\u2019s not a mean bone in her body. I like that about her. She\u2019s very analytical.

The white jacket is a reminder of her background in science, while the more armor-like pieces serves a reminder to the player that the galaxy is at war, and that civilians are part of the war effort where they have to arm and defend themselves.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n====''Mass Effect''====\n{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}\n[[File:LiaraOriginal.png|thumb|right|Prior to ''Mass Effect 3'', fans were most familiar with Liara's outfit in the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Art\"/> ]]\nLiara is the estranged child of Matriarch Benezia, a well-respected and powerful asari biotic.<ref name=\"Benezia\"/> Following the exposure of Benezia's involvement with the disgraced Spectre Saren Arterius and their search for an artifact known as the Conduit, Shepard is given a lead to search for Liara and discover what she knows. Liara pleads with Shepard for help when they encounter her in Therum, offering to explain her circumstances and means to be freed. If Shepard pursues other leads first and significantly delays rescuing Liara, she mistakes her rescuers for figments of her own imagination as a result of being stuck for so long. Nevertheless, she humors her \"hallucinations\" and answers their questions. She only realizes Shepard's squad are real when they reappear to release her.\n\nOn her first debriefing aboard the Normandy, Liara shares her theory of cyclical extinction: the Protheans were just the latest in a long line of civilizations to reach a violent end after reaching their apex. Liara notes that there is remarkably little evidence of the Protheans' existence, and speculates that their final fate has been deliberately covered up. As Shepard obtains fragmented visions from various sources during the hunt for Saren and his agents, Liara offers her melding abilities to try and make sense of the data. She constantly exhausts herself after each encounter, prompting frequent suggestions to report to Dr. Chakwas, but collects herself together long enough to explain what she saw. Once Shepard obtains the Cipher, the Mu Relay's location, and the distress call from the Prothean Beacon on Virmire, Liara finally recognizes enough clues to deduce the lost planet of Ilos as the Conduit's true location.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nLiara's role in the original trilogy is reduced in ''Mass Effect 2'', set two years after the first game. Liara has become an information broker on Illium in direct rivalry to the Shadow Broker. She initially depicts a radically changed personality due to her experience working as a black market information dealer in the two years since ''Mass Effect''; having improved her biotic abilities, she also uses threats and other intimidation tactics to extort information, mimicking Benezia's demeanour and speech tactics when confronting others. If the player imported a Shepard from the original ''Mass Effect'' that romanced Liara, she greets Shepard with a kiss. Liara's anger at the Broker stems from when he recovered Shepard's body and was prepared to sell it to the Collectors during the events of ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]''. After certain dialogue choices, the player is finally able to break through her shell and reveal the real Liara, revealing that her seemingly darker personality is nothing more than a facade. Liara took pains in getting Shepard's body from the Broker and gave it to Cerberus so they could bring Shepard back to life. Liara knew that Cerberus would use Shepard for their own uses, but still gave them Shepard's body as she cares for Shepard and could not let the Commander go. She feared that Shepard would hate her for this, and apologizes. In spite of wanting to join Shepard, she declines Shepard's offer to join the suicide mission to rescue human colonists, in order to continue her quest for revenge against the Shadow Broker. \n\nLiara joins Shepard's crew temporarily in the ''Mass Effect 2'' DLC ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' if the player decides to help her hunt down the Shadow Broker. Shepard gradually breaks her hardened shell after lecturing her about mindlessly running into battles, but at the same time she states that she won't stop \"to enjoy the scenery\" until she's done. After the Shadow Broker is killed, Liara takes the opportunity to usurp his now vacant role. She says she will use her position and resources to help assist Shepard's ongoing mission to fight the Reapers. It is also possible to resume the player character's romance with Liara at the end of \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\".\n\n====Mass Effect 3====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect 3}}\nLiara returns  in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a mainstay of Shepard's squad. Liara becomes the Shadow Broker regardless of whether the player imports a ''Mass Effect 2'' [[saved game]]  where ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' was completed; if not, she tells Shepard that she took on the Shadow Broker with dozens of hired mercenaries, but it resulted in Feron's death. If Shepard assisted her in taking out the Shadow Broker, she mentions that during the time that Shepard was in Alliance custody, Cerberus managed to track down the Shadow Broker's ship. Liara and Feron loaded as much equipment as they could onto a shuttle as possible, then remotely sent the aging ship crashing into a pursuing Cerberus cruiser, resulting in the destruction of both ships. Liara notes that she has retained the crucial part of the Broker's operation, the galaxy-wide spy network.\n\nAfter the events of ''Arrival'', Admiral Hackett commissioned for Liara's aid, and they both realized what little time the galaxy had left before the Reapers arrived. However, this brought her into direct conflict with the Illusive Man and Cerberus. Eventually, through a process of elimination, mixed with desperation, she discovered plans for a \"Prothean superweapon\" on Mars. However, by then the Reaper invasion has reached Earth. Liara's familiarity with Prothean artifacts as well as asari culture and history, along with the significant resources at her disposal as the Shadow Broker, means that she plays a pivotal role in ''Mass Effect 3's'' narrative and often provides additional dialogue for plot exposition purposes if she is included in the party during certain missions.<ref name=\"Companion\"/> During the war, Liara recorded a collection of intel on the Reapers and her current cycle, as well as the complete history of the species of Liara's time and their accumulated knowledge of how to fight them.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/> She stores the information within Glyph, her [[Virtual intelligence|VI]] drone assistant, and stashes it away as a time capsule.<ref name=\"Lesson\"/> The time capsule represents a contingency plan if the allied races of her time are not able to defeat the Reapers in this cycle and are wiped out, ensuring the next cycle will have a better opportunity to prepare for the Reapers' arrival, and a complete set of plans to start out from.<ref name=\"Forbes\"/>\n\nIf the ''From Ashes'' DLC is installed and the Prothean [[endling]] Javik is recruited as a squad member, she is initially overjoyed to have one serving aboard the Normandy, but slowly becomes disillusioned; she admitted that she had previously imagined the Protheans as the \"keepers of wisdom and enlightenment\" of their era, only to find them to be \"cold and ruthless warlords\". Eventually, her relationship with Javik reaches a breaking point after the fall of Thessia; Liara confronts Javik at him quarters and vents her frustration at him for \"not having the answers\". If Shepard intervenes to defuse the situation instead of allowing Liara to walk away, the two will begin to respect and appreciate each other.\n\nDuring the main narrative of the downloadable add-on ''[[Mass Effect 3: Citadel|Citadel]]'', Liara calls in a favor to find information on the gun found by Shepard after they are attacked by an unknown mercenary group during the crew's shore leave. She will later participate in the raid on the Citadel Archives with the rest of Shepard's crew to pursue the instigators behind the group's attack. The DLC also adds a number of character moments for the character, such as Liara playing the only song she knew how to on the piano located on the lower floor of Shepard's apartment, and her friendly rivalry with James Vega through debates and card games during the big party, culminating in Liara demonstrating her levitation powers on Vega while intoxicated.\n\n====Mass Effect: Andromeda====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Andromeda}}\nLiara T'Soni makes a cameo appearance in ''Andromeda'', in the form of voice messages sent to Alex Ryder in his quarters aboard the Hyperion. Pathfinder Ryder can unlock and listen to Liara's voice messages, which were originally sent in 2182, a year before her encounter with Shepard, where she discussed her research into the Protheans and their lost empire. Eventually, Ryder will unlock a message by Liara from 2186, sent to Alec while he was in stasis on the Hyperion traveling to Andromeda, informing him that the Reapers have arrived. She mentions the Crucible but warns Alec to expect the worst, and asks him and his children to not forget the people they left behind.\n\n===In other media===\n====''Mass Effect: Redemption''====\n{{Main article|Mass Effect: Redemption}}\nThe narrative in ''Redemption'' begins with Commander Shepard mysteriously disappearing in the Terminus Systems, out of contact with the SSV ''Normandy'' and its crew. Both the Shadow Broker and Liara T'Soni are to find and retrieve the dead body of Commander Shepard. Just as Tazzik, an agent of the Shadow Broker wants to turn over the corpse to the Collectors, Liara manages to capture it, with the help of the drell Feron, who is captured in the process, and turn it over to Cerberus, hoping that they may be able to revive Shepard.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Paragon Lost''====\nLiara appears as a minor character in the animated feature film ''[[Mass Effect: Paragon Lost]]''. This marks the only instance where Ali Hillis did not reprise her role as the character.\n\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nLiara is the protagonist of the fourth issue of ''Mass Effect: Homeworlds'', which takes place after the ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' DLC. As the new Shadow Broker, Liara desperately searches for a way to stop the [[Reaper]]s. Journeying to [[Thessia]] to examine the Prothean archives there, she is disappointed to learn how little they contain. A former colleague recommends investigating Kahje since its Prothean ruins are much more vast. Once there, Liara persuades a hanar official to allow her to visit a submerged Prothean site that had become a hanar shrine. A [[drell]] named Quoyle takes her to the shrine, but on arrival the shrine launches torpedoes at Quoyle's craft; a Cerberus [[Mass Effect 3|Phantom]] had killed the shrine's staff and activated the defenses. When the craft is hit, Liara uses her biotics to keep it from flooding while Quoyle guides it to the dock.\n\nAt the shrine, Liara encounters and kills the Phantom, using her biotics to slam a piece of debris through the Phantom's skull. Quoyle is wounded, but not mortally and tells Liara to go on to the archives. There, Liara discovers a promising lead in the form of encryption keys for other Prothean archives, but is interrupted by the Illusive Man. He insists that the Phantom is not his doing, blaming the attack on a rogue faction within Cerberus and proposes that they form an alliance against the Reapers. Liara agrees that to pool her resources with Cerberus's against the Reapers might be a mutually beneficial move, but she insists that he upload his information first. When the Illusive Man remains silent, Liara opines that either he wants to keep the information he has to himself, or that he doesn't have any information in the first place.\n\nAs Liara goes to leave, the Illusive Man insinuates that she doesn't have what it takes to be the Shadow Broker, claiming that his black market contacts think the Broker has become soft, weak and vulnerable to usurpation, insisting she needs his help; Liara retorts that he is the one trying to make a deal, advises him to send an army the next time he tries to kill her and leaves. As she helps Quoyle to the shrine's shuttle bay, she informs Admiral Hackett of her possible lead and asks for access to a top-secret facility on [[Mars]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"Liara is conflicted.

In a 2007 article written for ''GameSetWatch'', Chris Dahlen explained that while he found ''Mass Effect'' disappointing, particularly the lacklustre characterization of its NPC's, he noted that Liara was the \"less obnoxious\" of the available romance options and her explanations about the asari species well articulated.<ref name=\"GameSetWatch\"/> UGO.com included Liara in their list of the 50 sexiest female scientists.<ref name=\"Foxiest\"/> ''[[GamesRadar]]'s'' Jordan Baughman cited Liara's characterization in the first game as an example of BioWare's \"The Awkward Hottie\" character archetype, specifically a \"naive beauty who doesn\u2019t truly understand how harsh the world/universe can be\" and who \"turns into an absolute mess when placed in social settings\".<ref name=\"Recycled\"/> IGN ranked her fourth on their list of best ''Mass Effect'' teammates published in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/05/10-best-mass-effect-teammates?page=2 |title=10 Best Mass Effect Teammates|author= Steven Hopper|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=March 18, 2020 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the release of ''Mass Effect 3'', various media outlets have identified Liara as one of the trilogy's best characters.

''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W.

Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  \n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />.
