Harold is the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and is also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now Steaming Toward Fiji |url=https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/vanuatu-reeling-from-category-5-harold-now-steaming-toward-fiji |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |publisher=Weather Underground |date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> The seventh named storm of the [[2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season]], and the eighth named storm, fourth severe tropical cyclone, and the strongest tropical cyclone of the [[2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season]], Harold is the most intense tropical cyclone thus far [[Tropical cyclones in 2020|worldwide in 2020]].\n\nOn April&nbsp;1, a tropical low formed centered between the [[Solomon Islands]] and the eastern coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nDuring April&nbsp;1,

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nDuring April&nbsp;1,

Retrieved Dec 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nST was formed in 1987 by the merger of two government-owned semiconductor companies: SGS Microelettronica (Societ\u00e0 Generale Semiconduttori) of Italy and Thomson Semiconducteurs, the semiconductor arm of France's [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]:\n\nSGS Microelettronica originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies:\n* ATES (Aquila Tubi e Semiconduttori), a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in the [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] city of [[l'Aquila]], which in 1961 changed its name to ''Azienda Tecnica ed Elettronica del Sud'' and relocated its manufacturing plant to the outskirts of the Sicilian city of [[Catania]]\n* Societ\u00e0 Generale Semiconduttori (founded in 1957 by [[Adriano Olivetti]]).\n\nThomson Semiconducteurs was created in 1982 by the French government's widespread nationalisation of industries. It included:\n* the semiconductor activities of the French electronics company [[Thomson SA|Thomson]].\n* in 1985 it bought [[Mostek]], a US company founded in 1969 as a spin-off of [[Texas Instruments]], from UTC.\n* Silec, founded in 1977.\n* Eurotechnique founded in 1979 in [[Rousset, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]] as a [[joint-venture]] between [[Saint-Gobain]] of France and US-based [[National Semiconductor]].\n* EFCIS, founded in 1977.\n* SESCOSEM, founded in 1969.\n\nAt the time of the merger the company was named SGS-THOMSON but took its current name in May 1998 following Thomson\u2019s sale of its shares. After its creation ST was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around US$850 million. The company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation, with acquisitions including:\n\n* In 1989, British company [[Inmos]] known for its [[transputer]] [[microprocessor]]s from parent [[Thorn EMI]].\n* In 1994, Canada-based [[Nortel]]'s semiconductor activities.\n* In 2002, Alcatel's Microelectronics division, which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as UK company, Synad Ltd, helped the company expand into the Wireless-LAN market.\n* In 2007, US-based [[Genesis Microchip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investors.st.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stmicroelectronics-acquire-genesis-microchip |title=STMicroelectronics To Acquire Genesis Microchip}}</ref>  Genesis Microchip is known for their strength in video processing technology ([[Faroudja]]) and has design centres located in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Toronto]], Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C. and [[Bangalore]].\n\nOn December 8, 1994, the company completed its initial public offering on the Paris and [[New York Stock Exchange|New York]] stock exchanges. Owner Thomson SA sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the [[Borsa Italiana]] in [[Milan]].\n\nIn 2002, [[Motorola]] and [[TSMC]] joined ST and [[Philips]] in a new technology partnership. The Crolles2 Alliance was created with a new 12\" [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] manufacturing facility located in [[Crolles]] (France).\n\nBy 2005, ST was ranked fifth, behind [[Intel]], [[Samsung]], [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Toshiba]], but ahead of [[Infineon]], [[Renesas]], [[NEC]], [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]], and [[Freescale]]. The company was the largest European semiconductors supplier, ahead of Infineon and NXP.\n\nEarly in 2007, [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] (formerly Philips Semiconductors) and Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductors) decided to stop their participation in Crolles2 Alliance.

The Polygone site employs 2200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company (ex SGS). All the historical wafer [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]] lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions (marketing, design, industrialization) and an important R&D center, focused on silicon and software design and fab process development.\n\nThe [[Crolles]] site hosts a {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} fab and was originally built as a common R&D center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 ''Grenoble 92'' partnership between SGS-Thomson and [[Centre national d'\u00e9tudes des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CNET]], the R&D center of French telecom company '''France Telecom'''. The {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} fab, known as Crolles 1, is the company's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between SGS-Thomson and Philips to develop new manufacturing technologies. Crolles 1 was opened on September 9, 1993 by G\u00e9rard Longuet, French minister for industry.\n\nThe {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} fab was inaugurated by French president [[Jacques Chirac]], on February 27, 2003. It includes a R&D center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90&nbsp;nm to 32&nbsp;nm scale using {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} wafers and it was developed for ''The Crolles 2 Alliance'''. This alliance of STMicroelectronics, [[TSMC]], [[NXP Semiconductors]] (formerly [[Philips]] semiconductor) and [[Freescale]] (formerly [[Motorola]] semiconductor) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development. The technologies developed at the facility were also used by global semiconductor [[foundry]] [[TSMC]] of Taiwan, allowing TSMC to build the products developed in Crolles on behalf of the Alliance partners who required such foundry capacity.\nA new fab is under construction since 2015.\n\n===Rousset, France===\nEmploying around 3,000 staff, [[Rousset, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne|Rousset]] hosts several division headquarters including [[smartcard]]s, [[microcontrollers]], and [[EEPROM]] as well as several R&D centers. Rousset also hosts an 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) fab which was opened on May 15, 2000 by French prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]].\n\nThe site opened in 1979 as a {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]] operated by Eurotechnique, a joint venture between [[Saint-Gobain]] of France and [[National Semiconductor]] of the US. Rousset was sold to Thomson-CSF in 1982 as part of the French government's 1981-82 nationalization of several industries. As part of the nationalisation, a former Thomson plant in the center of [[Aix-en-Provence]] operating since the 1960s was closed and staff were transferred to the new Rousset site. The original {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]] was upgraded into {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} and later {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} fab in 1996.

It included:\n* the semiconductor activities of the French electronics company [[Thomson SA|Thomson]].\n* in 1985 it bought [[Mostek]], a US company founded in 1969 as a spin-off of [[Texas Instruments]], from UTC.\n* Silec, founded in 1977.\n* Eurotechnique founded in 1979 in [[Rousset, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]] as a [[joint-venture]] between [[Saint-Gobain]] of France and US-based [[National Semiconductor]].\n* EFCIS, founded in 1977.\n* SESCOSEM, founded in 1969.\n\nAt the time of the merger the company was named SGS-THOMSON but took its current name in May 1998 following Thomson\u2019s sale of its shares. After its creation ST was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around US$850 million. The company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation, with acquisitions including:\n\n* In 1989, British company [[Inmos]] known for its [[transputer]] [[microprocessor]]s from parent [[Thorn EMI]].\n* In 1994, Canada-based [[Nortel]]'s semiconductor activities.\n* In 2002, Alcatel's Microelectronics division, which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as UK company, Synad Ltd, helped the company expand into the Wireless-LAN market.\n* In 2007, US-based [[Genesis Microchip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investors.st.com/news-releases/news-release-details/stmicroelectronics-acquire-genesis-microchip |title=STMicroelectronics To Acquire Genesis Microchip}}</ref>  Genesis Microchip is known for their strength in video processing technology ([[Faroudja]]) and has design centres located in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[Toronto]], Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C. and [[Bangalore]].\n\nOn December 8, 1994, the company completed its initial public offering on the Paris and [[New York Stock Exchange|New York]] stock exchanges. Owner Thomson SA sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the [[Borsa Italiana]] in [[Milan]].\n\nIn 2002, [[Motorola]] and [[TSMC]] joined ST and [[Philips]] in a new technology partnership. The Crolles2 Alliance was created with a new 12\" [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] manufacturing facility located in [[Crolles]] (France).\n\nBy 2005, ST was ranked fifth, behind [[Intel]], [[Samsung]], [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Toshiba]], but ahead of [[Infineon]], [[Renesas]], [[NEC]], [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]], and [[Freescale]]. The company was the largest European semiconductors supplier, ahead of Infineon and NXP.\n\nEarly in 2007, [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] (formerly Philips Semiconductors) and Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductors) decided to stop their participation in Crolles2 Alliance.  Under the terms of the agreement the Alliance came to an end on December 31, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800469769_480200_NT_19a4c517.HTM/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101095429/http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800469769_480200_NT_19a4c517.HTM/ |archive-date=January 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn May 22, 2007, ST and Intel created a joint venture in the memory application called [[Numonyx]].

The Polygone site employs 2200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company (ex SGS). All the historical wafer [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]] lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions (marketing, design, industrialization) and an important R&D center, focused on silicon and software design and fab process development.\n\nThe [[Crolles]] site hosts a {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} fab and was originally built as a common R&D center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 ''Grenoble 92'' partnership between SGS-Thomson and [[Centre national d'\u00e9tudes des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications|CNET]], the R&D center of French telecom company '''France Telecom'''. The {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} fab, known as Crolles 1, is the company's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between SGS-Thomson and Philips to develop new manufacturing technologies. Crolles 1 was opened on September 9, 1993 by G\u00e9rard Longuet, French minister for industry.\n\nThe {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} fab was inaugurated by French president [[Jacques Chirac]], on February 27, 2003. It includes a R&D center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90&nbsp;nm to 32&nbsp;nm scale using {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} wafers and it was developed for ''The Crolles 2 Alliance'''. This alliance of STMicroelectronics, [[TSMC]], [[NXP Semiconductors]] (formerly [[Philips]] semiconductor) and [[Freescale]] (formerly [[Motorola]] semiconductor) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development. The technologies developed at the facility were also used by global semiconductor [[foundry]] [[TSMC]] of Taiwan, allowing TSMC to build the products developed in Crolles on behalf of the Alliance partners who required such foundry capacity.\nA new fab is under construction since 2015.\n\n===Rousset, France===\nEmploying around 3,000 staff, [[Rousset, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne|Rousset]] hosts several division headquarters including [[smartcard]]s, [[microcontrollers]], and [[EEPROM]] as well as several R&D centers.

After four years of preparation, the '''Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology''' was opened in September 1985. The museum was later renamed the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in June 1990, following its bestowal of the title \"royal\" from Queen [[Elizabeth II]].

The first expansion was designed by BCW Architects, and was completed in 2003; while the second expansion was designed by Kasian Architecture, and was completed in 2019.\n\nThe museum's personal collection includes over 160,000 cataloged fossils, consisting of over 350 [[holotype]]s.
