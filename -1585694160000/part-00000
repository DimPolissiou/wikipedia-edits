These include [[John Sparkes]], [[Sarah Ann Kennedy]], [[David Rintoul]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]].

The Little Kingdom is ruled by King and Queen Thistle mainly from the Little Castle, where they live with their 3 daughters Holly and younger twins Daisy and Poppy. Elves live at the Great Elf Tree, which acts as a school, library, apartment block and factory for toys and wands. Elves hold the belief that they should never arrive late to anything. Civil fairies live in the Fairy Village, which consists of toadstools which have doors and windows.\n\nFairies use magic and most of the fairies are named after flowers and plants. Elves have their own catchphrase, \"...and I'm an Elf\" (or \"We're Elves\"), and fairies also have their own catchphrase, commonly \"I'm a fairy\". Elves tell the time with wrist watches and/or clocks, while fairies tell the time in very unconventional ways. The Elves operate Elf Rescue, the Elf Farm and the Elf Windmill. King Thistle likes to play golf and crazy golf at the Royal Course. Ben and Holly have a ladybird friend called Gaston. Nanny Plum and the Wise Old Elf are characters too, and they have important jobs to do in the context of the show. Mr. and Mrs. Elf are Ben's parents. The Wise Old Elf is not married anymore but has three sons.\n\n== Characters ==\n* Ben Elf is one of the main characters alongside Princess Holly. He lives with his parents, Mr. & Mrs. Elf. He lives in the Great Elf Tree, number 4. He can be quite tentative when it comes to using magic, as Ben is a young elf. He does not have any siblings, but has many friends, and his best friend is Princess Holly. Ben is voiced by Preston Nyman.\n\n* Holly Thistle is a fairy and one of the main characters alongside Ben Elf. She lives with her parents, King and Queen Thistle, and with her little sisters, Daisy & Poppy. She likes to use magic despite the risk of things going wrong. Her best friend is Ben Elf. Holly is voiced by Sian Taylor\n\n* Lucy is a human girl (one of the 'big people' to the citizens of the Little Kingdom) and one of Ben and Holly's friends. She wears an orange dress and has pale skin and brown hair. She lives with her parents. She befriends Ben and Holly when they accompany Nanny Plum while she is on the job as the tooth fairy and was woken up by them, but keeps their existence a secret. Lucy is voiced by Abigail Daniels.\n\n* King Thistle (his real name is Kevin) rules over the Little Kingdom. He is the husband of Queen Thistle and Princess Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's father. He is often hungry and grumpy, and sometimes hates having a bath. He dislikes celebrating his birthday because it reminds him he is getting older. When he was Holly's age, he was known as Prince Thistle. King Thistle is voiced by [[Ian Puleston-Davies]].\n\n* Queen Thistle (her real name is Cheryl) is the Queen in the Little Kingdom and the wife of King Thistle. She is Princess Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's mother. Queen Thistle is Queen Marigold's younger sister. She is one of the few people who can handle looking after Daisy and Poppy, though at times even she can be overwhelmed by the trouble they cause with their magic. Queen Thistle is voiced by [[Sara Crowe]].\n\n* Daisy and Poppy are Holly's little twin sisters. They are not very good at magic as they are only babies, but this does not stop them from trying. They are quite cheeky and usually end up causing trouble with magic. As Daisy and Poppy can be very naughty, Holly sometimes dislikes her sisters. Due to the trouble they cause with their magic, most of the adult characters are wary of them, though Queen Thistle seems to be able to deal with them for the most part. Daisy and Poppy are voiced by Zoe Baker.\n\n* Nanny Plum (her real name is Sonya) is Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's [[nanny]], and a general housekeeper for the King and Queen. She is very good at magic and capable of speaking many animal languages (including ones which she claims to be a bit difficult such as [[Mole (animal)|Mole]], [[Aardvark]], Ant, [[Centipede]] and [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]]). She often ends up in all kinds of trouble when trying to help Holly and friends. She is also a tooth fairy. Although being quite bossy and savage, she is very good at cleaning with magic. She rivals the Wise Old Elf mainly due to their differing opinions over the use of magic. She is a teacher at the Fairy School and also works as a maid. Nanny Plum is voiced by [[Sarah Ann Kennedy]].\n\n* The Wise Old Elf (his real name is Cedric) lives in the same tree as Ben at the top in room 98. He also is the Wise Old Tailor, the elf doctor and the librarian. He also runs the Elf School and The Elf factory. He rivals Nanny Plum and strongly disapproves of magic, but used to admire magic and enjoyed himself when he was briefly given the ability to use magic. He also secretly used magic to fuel the Elf Engine that runs the Elf Factory, as it is clean energy (\"a very small Carbon Footprint\") and never runs out except on No Magic Day that occurs every blue moon. He had three sons, two of which are pirates, Redbeard the Elf Pirate and Captain Squid, and a sensible son who later decided to be a Viking, as shown in the episode 'Fathers Day'. The Wise Old Elf's real name is Cedric. He went to college with Granny and Granpapa Thistle. He has a twin brother, an Arctic Elf named The Wiser Older Elf. The Wise Old Elf is voiced by [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]].\n\nA running gag is that Elf Rescue is a parody of International Rescue in the 1960s television series ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', with comparable rocket-powered rescue vehicles and similar strident accompanying music. David Graham, who voices the Wise Old Elf, also voiced [[Aloysius Parker|Parker]] the chauffeur in ''Thunderbirds''.\n\n* Gaston Ladybird is a male [[ladybird]] who lives in a small cave. He likes his house being messy as well as food that is \"smelly and foul\". He does not mind giving Ben rides when Ben needs to fly. Nanny Plum, who understands Ladybird language, translates for him quite often. He acts quite similarly to a dog, making a barking sound when he \"speaks\", and fetching sticks. Gaston has a brother, Tony, a sister-in-law, Pam, two nieces, Amber and Emerald, and a nephew, Keith. Gaston is voiced by Taig McNab, who is also credited as Editor for Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom.\n\n* Redbeard the Elf Pirate (Nigel) is the pirate uncle of Barnaby Elf, and brother of Fred Elf. He is introduced in series 1, episode 31, where it is also revealed that his real name is Nigel. He sails the oceans in a pirate ship named Pedro, though his size prevents him from engaging in acts of actual piracy, and he is more of a treasure hunter and explorer. He is quite smitten with Nanny Plum whom he considers to be his sweetheart, although Nanny seems to have little interest in him romantically. He has a pet parrot, Polly, although she is normal sized and barely fits inside Redbeard's ship. Redbeard is voiced by [[David Rintoul]].\n\n*Sally (Credited as \"Lucy's Mum\") is Lucy's mother, who lives near the little kingdom with Lucy and her husband. Unlike her husband, Sally is aware of the existence of elves and fairies as she has been friends with Nanny Plum, Prince Thistle (subsequently King Thistle), and the Wise Old Elf, since she was a little girl, and like her daughter, keeps their existence a secret.\n\n*Lucy's Father lives near the little kingdom with Lucy and his wife. Whilst initially unaware of the existence of the little kingdom, he discovered their existence as a result of the attempts of the citizens of the little kingdom to prevent him building a place for his cows in the meadow where the little kingdom is located. He keeps their existence a secret, though he does so as he seems to think that other people would think he was crazy if he told them. \n\n*Mrs. Fig is the teacher of the Magic School. Nanny Plum used to go there and Holly and her friends went there when they were old enough. Despite being a fairy, she detests magic and says the most important rules of magic are \"Don't use magic\" and \"Magic should only be used for serious things\". As a result, the Wise Old Elf likes her as they have similar views on magic. Mrs. Fig loathes Nanny Plum, who is implied to have been her worst student as she does not adhere to Mrs. Fig's ideas on magic. Mrs. Fig is voiced by [[Morwenna Banks]].\n\n*Mrs. Fotheringill is Daisy and Poppy's playgroup teacher. She was at one point sent back in time to the age of the dinosaurs by Daisy, Poppy, and the other fairy children in her playgroup.\n\n*Fairy Mayor is a character based on [[Boris Johnson]], the former [[Mayor of London]].<ref name=Express2012>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Kirsty|title=Boris Johnson has new role in Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/361905/Boris-Johnson-has-new-role-in-Ben-and-Holly-s-Little-Kingdom|work=www.express.co.uk|publisher=Northern and Shell Media Publications|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=2 December 2012}}</ref> He is Strawberry's dad and the vet's husband.

children's [[television series]] aimed at children originally broadcast on [[Nickelodeon (UK)|Nickelodeon UK]].\n\nIt is broadcast across [[Nickelodeon]]'s channels throughout [[Africa]], [[Asia-Pacific]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Latin America]] and [[North America]].\n\nThe show is created by Neville Astley and [[Mark Baker (animator)|Mark Baker]], and produced by [[Astley Baker Davies]] and [[Entertainment One]] (the companies responsible for ''[[Peppa Pig]]'').<ref>{{Cite

Pig'' also work on ''Little Kingdom''. These include [[John Sparkes]], [[Sarah Ann Kennedy]], [[David Rintoul]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]]. The music is produced by [[Julian Nott]], who is noted for his [[Wallace and Gromit]] and [[Peppa Pig]] scores.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.juliannottmusic.com/Julian_Nott/Welcome.html|title=Julian Nott \u2013 Film Music Composer|website=www.juliannottmusic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is set in the Little Kingdom which is hidden among thorny brambles. The Little Kingdom is ruled by King and Queen Thistle mainly from the Little Castle, where they live with their 3 daughters Holly and younger twins Daisy and Poppy. Elves live at the Great Elf Tree, which acts as a school, library, apartment block and factory for toys and wands. Elves hold the belief that they should never arrive late to anything. Civil fairies live in the Fairy Village, which consists of toadstools which have doors and windows.\n\nFairies use magic and most of the fairies are named after flowers and plants. Elves have their own catchphrase, \"...and I'm an Elf\" (or \"We're Elves\"), and fairies also have their own catchphrase, commonly \"I'm a fairy\". Elves tell the time with wrist watches and/or clocks, while fairies tell the time in very unconventional ways. The Elves operate Elf Rescue, the Elf Farm and the Elf Windmill. King Thistle likes to play golf and crazy golf at the Royal Course. Ben and Holly have a ladybird friend called Gaston. Nanny Plum and the Wise Old Elf are characters too, and they have important jobs to do in the context of the show. Mr. and Mrs. Elf are Ben's parents. The Wise Old Elf is not married anymore but has three sons.\n\n== Characters ==\n* Ben Elf is one of the main characters alongside Princess Holly. He lives with his parents, Mr. & Mrs. Elf. He lives in the Great Elf Tree, number 4. He can be quite tentative when it comes to using magic, as Ben is a young elf. He does not have any siblings, but has many friends, and his best friend is Princess Holly. Ben is voiced by Preston Nyman.\n\n* Holly Thistle is a fairy and one of the main characters alongside Ben Elf. She lives with her parents, King and Queen Thistle, and with her little sisters, Daisy & Poppy. She likes to use magic despite the risk of things going wrong. Her best friend is Ben Elf. Holly is voiced by Sian Taylor\n\n* Lucy is a human girl (one of the 'big people' to the citizens of the Little Kingdom) and one of Ben and Holly's friends. She wears an orange dress and has pale skin and brown hair. She lives with her parents. She befriends Ben and Holly when they accompany Nanny Plum while she is on the job as the tooth fairy and was woken up by them, but keeps their existence a secret. Lucy is voiced by Abigail Daniels.\n\n* King Thistle (his real name is Kevin) rules over the Little Kingdom. He is the husband of Queen Thistle and Princess Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's father. He is often hungry and grumpy, and sometimes hates having a bath. He dislikes celebrating his birthday because it reminds him he is getting older. When he was Holly's age, he was known as Prince Thistle. King Thistle is voiced by [[Ian Puleston-Davies]].\n\n* Queen Thistle (her real name is Cheryl) is the Queen in the Little Kingdom and the wife of King Thistle. She is Princess Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's mother. Queen Thistle is Queen Marigold's younger sister. She is one of the few people who can handle looking after Daisy and Poppy, though at times even she can be overwhelmed by the trouble they cause with their magic. Queen Thistle is voiced by [[Sara Crowe]].\n\n* Daisy and Poppy are Holly's little twin sisters. They are not very good at magic as they are only babies, but this does not stop them from trying. They are quite cheeky and usually end up causing trouble with magic. As Daisy and Poppy can be very naughty, Holly sometimes dislikes her sisters. Due to the trouble they cause with their magic, most of the adult characters are wary of them, though Queen Thistle seems to be able to deal with them for the most part. Daisy and Poppy are voiced by Zoe Baker.\n\n* Nanny Plum (her real name is Sonya) is Holly, Daisy, and Poppy's [[nanny]], and a general housekeeper for the King and Queen. She is very good at magic and capable of speaking many animal languages (including ones which she claims to be a bit difficult such as [[Mole (animal)|Mole]], [[Aardvark]], Ant, [[Centipede]] and [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]]). She often ends up in all kinds of trouble when trying to help Holly and friends. She is also a tooth fairy. Although being quite bossy and savage, she is very good at cleaning with magic. She rivals the Wise Old Elf mainly due to their differing opinions over the use of magic. She is a teacher at the Fairy School and also works as a maid. Nanny Plum is voiced by [[Sarah Ann Kennedy]].\n\n* The Wise Old Elf (his real name is Cedric) lives in the same tree as Ben at the top in room 98. He also is the Wise Old Tailor, the elf doctor and the librarian. He also runs the Elf School and The Elf factory. He rivals Nanny Plum and strongly disapproves of magic, but used to admire magic and enjoyed himself when he was briefly given the ability to use magic. He also secretly used magic to fuel the Elf Engine that runs the Elf Factory, as it is clean energy (\"a very small Carbon Footprint\") and never runs out except on No Magic Day that occurs every blue moon. He had three sons, two of which are pirates, Redbeard the Elf Pirate and Captain Squid, and a sensible son who later decided to be a Viking, as shown in the episode 'Fathers Day'. The Wise Old Elf's real name is Cedric. He went to college with Granny and Granpapa Thistle. He has a twin brother, an Arctic Elf named The Wiser Older Elf. The Wise Old Elf is voiced by [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]].\n\nA running gag is that Elf Rescue is a parody of International Rescue in the 1960s television series ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', with comparable rocket-powered rescue vehicles and similar strident accompanying music. David Graham, who voices the Wise Old Elf, also voiced [[Aloysius Parker|Parker]] the chauffeur in ''Thunderbirds''.\n\n* Gaston Ladybird is a male [[ladybird]] who lives in a small cave. He likes his house being messy as well as food that is \"smelly and foul\". He does not mind giving Ben rides when Ben needs to fly. Nanny Plum, who understands Ladybird language, translates for him quite often. He acts quite similarly to a dog, making a barking sound when he \"speaks\", and fetching sticks. Gaston has a brother, Tony, a sister-in-law, Pam, two nieces, Amber and Emerald, and a nephew, Keith. Gaston is voiced by Taig McNab, who is also credited as Editor for Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom.\n\n* Redbeard the Elf Pirate (Nigel) is the pirate uncle of Barnaby Elf, and brother of Fred Elf. He is introduced in series 1, episode 31, where it is also revealed that his real name is Nigel. He sails the oceans in a pirate ship named Pedro, though his size prevents him from engaging in acts of actual piracy, and he is more of a treasure hunter and explorer. He is quite smitten with Nanny Plum whom he considers to be his sweetheart, although Nanny seems to have little interest in him romantically. He has a pet parrot, Polly, although she is normal sized and barely fits inside Redbeard's ship. Redbeard is voiced by [[David Rintoul]].\n\n*Sally (Credited as \"Lucy's Mum\") is Lucy's mother, who lives near the little kingdom with Lucy and her husband. Unlike her husband, Sally is aware of the existence of elves and fairies as she has been friends with Nanny Plum, Prince Thistle (subsequently King Thistle), and the Wise Old Elf, since she was a little girl, and like her daughter, keeps their existence a secret.\n\n*Lucy's Father lives near the little kingdom with Lucy and his wife. Whilst initially unaware of the existence of the little kingdom, he discovered their existence as a result of the attempts of the citizens of the little kingdom to prevent him building a place for his cows in the meadow where the little kingdom is located. He keeps their existence a secret, though he does so as he seems to think that other people would think he was crazy if he told them. \n\n*Mrs. Fig is the teacher of the Magic School. Nanny Plum used to go there and Holly and her friends went there when they were old enough. Despite being a fairy, she detests magic and says the most important rules of magic are \"Don't use magic\" and \"Magic should only be used for serious things\". As a result, the Wise Old Elf likes her as they have similar views on magic. Mrs. Fig loathes Nanny Plum, who is implied to have been her worst student as she does not adhere to Mrs. Fig's ideas on magic. Mrs. Fig is voiced by [[Morwenna Banks]].\n\n*Mrs. Fotheringill is Daisy and Poppy's playgroup teacher. She was at one point sent back in time to the age of the dinosaurs by Daisy, Poppy, and the other fairy children in her playgroup.\n\n*Fairy Mayor is a character based on [[Boris Johnson]], the former [[Mayor of London]].<ref name=Express2012>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Kirsty|title=Boris Johnson has new role in Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/361905/Boris-Johnson-has-new-role-in-Ben-and-Holly-s-Little-Kingdom|work=www.express.co.uk|publisher=Northern and Shell Media Publications|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=2 December 2012}}</ref> He is Strawberry's dad and the vet's husband. He does not like \"big people\" because they always step on fairies and elves.

It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer's Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a {{convert|22000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} meeting facility.

Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7\u201312).  Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

It stopped at the Jimenez Station in Aguadilla for a routine [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] and [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] exchange with Train No. 4 which was heading towards San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3's ride from Jimenez Station to Ponce was Jose Antonio Roman, an experienced freight train engineer, but who had never worked in passenger travel.<ref name=\"endi\"/> When the train left the station at 2:00 am, it was hauling 6 passenger cars with hundreds of commuters and two freight cars.\n[[File:Cuesta Vieja, street in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|{{lang|es|Cuesta Vieja}} in Aguadilla]]\n\nAt 2:20&nbsp;a.m. the train started to descend a hill section known as ''Cuesta Vieja'' (Old Hill) in Aguadilla at what some witnesses described as an exaggerated speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it [[Derailment|derailed]]. The steam locomotive crashed into a ditch where it exploded and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage.<ref name=\"endi\"/> Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to the local [[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]] newspaper, summarized the scene in a more dramatic way: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".<ref name=\"endi\"/> In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|title=Puerto Rico y aquel tren que nunca lleg\u00f3 a destino|language=es|access-date=2019-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928140427/http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|archive-date=2019-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nAguadilla is located in the northwest coast of the island of [[Puerto Rico]], in the Western Coastal Plains.

founded in 1775 by Luis de C\u00f3rdova, is a city and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] located in the northwestern tip of [[Puerto Rico]], bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]], and [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] and west of [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]]. Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer's Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a {{convert|22000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} meeting facility. The hospital is now the Courtyard by Marriott Punta Borinquen Resort & Casino,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bqncy-courtyard-aguadilla |title=Marriott.com |access-date=2007-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012044552/http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bqncy-courtyard-aguadilla |archive-date=2007-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> a 150-room hotel with a casino and the first Marriott in Puerto Rico out of the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] Metropolitan Area.\n\nRamey also hosts the [[University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla|University of Puerto Rico \u2013 Aguadilla Campus]] and the Friedrich Froebel Bilingual School<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.froebelbilingualschool.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827093233/http://www.froebelbilingualschool.com/ |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> (K-9).

Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7\u201312).  Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

It stopped at the Jimenez Station in Aguadilla for a routine [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] and [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] exchange with Train No. 4 which was heading towards San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3's ride from Jimenez Station to Ponce was Jose Antonio Roman, an experienced freight train engineer, but who had never worked in passenger travel.<ref name=\"endi\"/> When the train left the station at 2:00 am, it was hauling 6 passenger cars with hundreds of commuters and two freight cars.\n[[File:Cuesta Vieja, street in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|{{lang|es|Cuesta Vieja}} in Aguadilla]]\n\nAt 2:20&nbsp;a.m. the train started to descend a hill section known as ''Cuesta Vieja'' (Old Hill) in Aguadilla at what some witnesses described as an exaggerated speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it [[Derailment|derailed]]. The steam locomotive crashed into a ditch where it exploded and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage.<ref name=\"endi\"/> Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to the local [[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]] newspaper, summarized the scene in a more dramatic way: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".<ref name=\"endi\"/> In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|title=Puerto Rico y aquel tren que nunca lleg\u00f3 a destino|language=es|access-date=2019-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928140427/http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|archive-date=2019-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nAguadilla is located in the northwest coast of the island of [[Puerto Rico]], in the Western Coastal Plains.

It is an adaptation of [[Candace Bushnell]]'s [[Sex and the City (book)|1997 book of the same name]]. The series premiered in the United States on June 6, 1998, and concluded on February 22, 2004, with 94 episodes broadcast over six seasons. Throughout its development, the series received contributions from various producers, screenwriters, and directors, principally [[Michael Patrick King]].\n\nSet and filmed in [[New York City]], the show follows the lives of a group of four women\u2014three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties\u2014who, despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other. Starring [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] (as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]) and co-starring [[Kim Cattrall]] (as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]), [[Kristin Davis]] (as [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]]), and [[Cynthia Nixon]] (as [[Miranda Hobbes]]), the series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[safe sex]], [[promiscuity]], and [[femininity]], while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life\u2014from sex to relationships\u2014through each of their four very different, individual perspectives.\n\n''Sex and the City'' has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network.<ref>Nussbaum, Emily (July 29, 2013). \"[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women Difficult Women: How \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 Lost its Good Name]\". ''New Yorker''.</ref> The series has won several accolades, including seven of its 54 [[Emmy Award]] nominations, eight of its 24 [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, and three of its 11 [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations.

It spawned two feature films, ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'' (2008) and ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' (2010), and a [[prequel]] television series commissioned by [[The CW]], ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'' (2013\u20132014).\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe show was based in part on writer [[Candace Bushnell]]'s 1997 [[Sex and the City (book)|book of the same name]], compiled from her column at ''[[The New York Observer]]''. Bushnell has said in several interviews that the [[Carrie Bradshaw]] in her columns is her [[alter ego]]; when she wrote the \"Sex and the City\" essays, she used her own name initially, but for privacy reasons, later created the character played in the series by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. Carrie Bradshaw was a writer living in New York City. Carrie Bradshaw and Candace Bushnell have the same initials, a flourish emphasizing their connection. Moreover, just as Carrie Bradshaw has articles for the fictional ''New York Star'' published as a book in later series, the entire ''Sex and the City'' series is based on a compilation of Bushnell's own columns for the ''New York Observer''.\n\n''Sex and the City'' creator [[Darren Star]] wrote the pilot with Parker in mind as Carrie. According to Parker, \"I was flattered but didn't want to do it. He convinced me, begged me to do it, and I signed a contract.\"<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/entertainment/feature/022706feature.htm|title=365gay.com|work=Sarah Jessica Parker|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323111952/http://www.365gay.com/entertainment/feature/022706feature.htm|archivedate=March 23, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 16, 2006|df=mdy-all}} available at the</ref> The pilot episode was subsequently shot in June 1997, a year before the series premiered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Karla |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sex-and-the-city-darren-star-offered-kristin-davis-carrie-role/ |title='Sex and the City\u2019 Boss Darren Star Offered Kristin Davis the Role of Carrie |publisher=Usmagazine.com |date=2018-05-07 |accessdate=2019-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/au/news/939792/hair-changes-nudity-clauses-and-sarah-jessica-parker-s-reluctance-how-sex-and-the-city-painstakingly-came-together |title=Hair Changes, Nudity Clauses and Sarah Jessica Parker's Reluctance: How Sex and the City Painstakingly Came Together &#124; E!

I didn't think it worked\" and feared it would end her career.<ref name=\"tv\" /> She wanted to get out of the contract, offering to work in three HBO movies unpaid. Though Star would not release her, he listened to her concerns and implemented major changes before shooting the first season. Parker said: \"The funny thing, after the first episode of season one, I never looked back and the rest is history. I never thought, though, that the show would become what it has become.\"<ref name=\"tv\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Sex and the City characters}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|align     = left\n|image1    = Sarah Jessica Parker at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival 3.jpg\n|caption1  = Columnist [[Carrie Bradshaw]] is played by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]\n|width1    = 200\n|image2    = Kristindavis1999.jpg\n|caption2  = Art dealer and housewife [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt]] is played by [[Kristin Davis]]\n|width2    = 200\n}}\n\n===Carrie Bradshaw===\n[[Carrie Bradshaw]] ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) is the narrator and main protagonist, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, with each episode structured around her train of thought while writing her weekly column \"Sex and the City\" for the fictitious paper, the ''New York Star.'' A member of the New York glitterati, she is a [[Nightclub|club]]/bar/restaurant staple known for her unique fashion sense and lives in a studio apartment in an [[Upper East Side]] [[brownstone]]. Stanford Blatch, a gay talent agent from an aristocratic family (played by [[Willie Garson]]), is Carrie's best friend outside of the other three women.\n\nCarrie is entangled with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]] ([[Chris Noth]]), a prominent businessman and an aficionado of jazz and cigars whose real name is revealed in the final episode (Season 6, Episode 8) to be John James Preston, in a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. (In a running joke, whenever Carrie is about to introduce Mr. Big on-camera to another character, she is interrupted before she can say his name.) He is the reason for many of Carrie's breakdowns as he never seems ready to fully commit to her. He is once-divorced by the time the series opens.\n\nCarrie and Big break up when he leaves New York for a work secondment to Paris and does not show willingness for Carrie to accompany him nor to continue a long-distance relationship, citing commitment issues. Carrie is heartbroken and some months later runs into Big at a party in the Hamptons. He is accompanied by his 20-something year-old girlfriend, Natasha, whom he met in Paris. Despite this, Carrie attempts to be friends with Big. However, this goes awry when he tells her that he and Natasha are getting married, something he'd never considered with Carrie.\n\nIn season 3, Carrie meets and is instantly attracted to up-and-coming [[Manhattan]] furniture designer Aidan Shaw ([[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]) who becomes her boyfriend. Aidan is more traditional and patient about relationships than many of Carrie's other love interests, and for a while they are happy together. At a furniture show, the pair run into Natasha and Big, who confides to Carrie that he made a mistake marrying Natasha and wants out. Soon afterward, Big and Carrie begin an affair, which ends only when Natasha catches Carrie at Big's apartment.\n\nWracked with guilt, Carrie tells Aidan of the affair on the day of Charlotte's wedding to Trey, and Aidan breaks up with her. Aidan and Carrie reunite in Season 4, when Aidan opens a bar with Miranda's ex, Steve. Carrie realizes she is still in love with Aidan and wins him back. He struggles to trust her, particularly as Mr. Big has gotten divorced from Natasha, and he and Carrie maintain a platonic friendship. Carrie stands firm on her friendship with Big, even inviting him up to Aidan's cabin after a girl had broken up with him.\n\nWhen Carrie's building goes co-op, Aidan offers to buy her apartment (and the one next door) so they can move in together. She agrees and later finds an engagement ring in his gym bag. Aidan later proposes, and Carrie accepts.\n\nAidan is initially patient with Carrie's reluctance to set a wedding date but soon begins to push her, suggesting they get married in Hawaii. Carrie has a panic attack whilst trying on wedding dresses with Miranda, and again when Aidan is knocking down the wall between her apartment and the one next door. She confesses to Aidan that she's not ready and needs more time. He agrees to slow things down but, at a Black and White ball not long afterward, he pressures her to commit, making it clear that he still doesn't trust she's over Big. Carrie cannot commit, and they break up soon afterward.\n\nThe famous artist Aleksandr Petrovsky ([[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]) becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. Despite their age difference, he sweeps her off her feet with huge romantic gestures and shows her foreign pockets of New York she has never seen before.\n\nCarrie also makes plans to move to [[Paris]] with Aleksandr for his work. The rest of the women are not keen on Aleksandr, particularly Miranda, who feels that he is controlling and that Carrie is different around him.\n\nOn the night before Carrie leaves, Mr. Big turns up at her home. The two argue in the street with Carrie accusing him of turning up whenever she's happy to ruin things for her. She tells him to leave her alone.\n\nWhen Carrie arrives in Paris, she finds Aleksandr frequently absent with work on his art show. She is left to wander the streets of Paris alone day after day and begins to regret her decision. She confides in Miranda during a phone conversation that she is lonely and that Aleks is neglecting her.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, Charlotte hears a message Mr. Big leaves Carrie on her answering machine admitting that he loves her. Charlotte invites Big to the coffee shop where he enlists the help of Carrie's friends, asking if they think he has a chance. Miranda, armed with the information from Carrie, simply says, \"Go get our girl\", and Big goes to Paris to win her back.\n\nCarrie, having once again been abandoned by Aleksandr (having given up the opportunity to go to a party with some new friends to accompany him to a preview of his show), has it out with him in their hotel room. Aleksandr smacks Carrie in the face and breaks her diamond necklace.\n\nAs Carrie is in the lobby, trying to obtain a room for the night, Big walks in. They see each other, he tells her she's \"the one\" (something she's been waiting for their entire relationship), and he takes her home to New York.\n\n===Charlotte York===\n[[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]] ([[Kristin Davis]]) has had a conventional, privileged [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Connecticut]] upbringing and works in an art gallery. Charlotte is a classic over-achiever and perfectionist: a \"straight A\" student who attended [[Smith College]], where she was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] (note that there are no sororities at the real Smith College) majoring in art history with a minor in finance. During the series, it is also revealed that Charlotte was voted [[homecoming]] queen, [[prom]] queen, \"most popular\", student body president, and track team captain, in addition to being an active cheerleader and teen model.\n\nShe is the [[antithesis]] of Samantha: optimistic, hopelessly romantic, and a believer in true love and soul mates. She places the most emphasis on emotional love as opposed to lust. From the beginning, Charlotte is searching for her \"[[knight in shining armor]]\", and nothing shakes her belief of finding \"the one\", getting married, and starting a family. All her dating activity during the show is in pursuit of a long-term, monogamous boyfriend with a view to marriage. As such, she typically dates men of \"pedigree\" and money (bankers, doctors, lawyers, etc.).\n\nCharlotte can be a dark horse, and we learn that she once had a dalliance with an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish artist, she dressed in drag for a portrait, and she allowed an artist to paint a picture of her [[vulva]]. She can be an \"East Side Princess\" sometimes, and she and Samantha occasionally come to blows over their differing opinions about love and sex.\n\nIn season 3, Charlotte decides she will be married that year and sets about canvassing her married friends to set her up on dates. One married friend usurps her blind date to try and start an affair with her. Horrified, she dashes into the street and trips in front of a taxi, carrying Trey MacDougal ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), an attractive, old-money, Scottish-American cardiologist with pedigree, a [[Park Avenue]] apartment and country estate in Connecticut. They fall in love at first sight, and he appears to be everything she has always wanted. Things move quickly and Charlotte, convinced he is the one, suggests they marry. He agrees, and they are married very shortly afterward (with the help of wedding planner Anthony Marentino; a gay Sicilian who is as forceful as Charlotte is timid).\n\nWishing to \"do things the right way\", Charlotte has withheld having sex with Trey, hoping for a romantic and traditional wedding night. On the evening before the big day, she gets drunk with the other women and goes to Trey for sex. Unfortunately, it does not go well; Trey reveals he suffers from [[impotence]].\n\nWhile concerned, Charlotte presses ahead with the wedding, although she confides in Carrie just before walking down the aisle. As the marriage begins things do not get any better in their intimate relationship, and Trey refuses to address matters either physically or psychologically, resisting their marriage counselor's advice. Matters are not helped by Trey's overbearing mother Bunny ([[Frances Sternhagen]]), a manipulative sort who intrudes on Trey and Charlotte's relationship and apartment on a regular basis. Not long into the marriage, on a weekend trip to the MacDougal country estate, Charlotte is caught in a clinch with the hunky gardener and this seals the fate of her marriage to Trey. Trey and Charlotte separate, and she moves back into her old apartment.\n\nWhile separated, Charlotte and Trey mend their sexual relationship and get back together. All seems to be well, and Charlotte resumes living with Trey. To mark a new beginning and letting go of Bunny's control, she redecorates the apartment, and the couple decides to create a baby room and try for a baby. Having no luck, Charlotte seeks fertility treatment and is told she has a very low chance of becoming pregnant. Seeking other options, she begins hormone injections and looks into adopting a Chinese baby girl.\n\nA combination of these factors once again ignites old tensions with Trey and Bunny, culminating in Trey's deciding he no longer wants a family. This blow to her hopes and dreams proves too much for Charlotte, and she finishes the marriage once and for all.\n\nWhen Charlotte's marriage ends, she meets Harry Goldenblatt ([[Evan Handler]]), her Jewish divorce lawyer, at the beginning of season 5. She is not attracted to him initially but, spurred on by Anthony, she starts a purely physical relationship with Harry. Harry is the opposite of Trey: short, bald, hairy, uncouth but funny, passionate, and attentive. Their sexual relationship is fulfilling, and eventually they begin dating properly. However, Harry says he cannot be serious with Charlotte because she isn't a Jew.\n\nBelieving Harry to be her future, Charlotte converts to Judaism and this sees her struggle with losing her Christian faith and ideologies including Christmas and Easter. After her conversion, Charlotte celebrates her first [[Shabbat]] with Harry but loses her temper when he appears to not appreciate all her efforts. The row quickly evolves into Charlotte's badgering Harry to propose and, feeling pressured, he storms out, and they break up.\n\nCharlotte is heartbroken. Some time later, at a singles event at the [[synagogue]], she bumps into Harry. She tells him she loves him and doesn't care if he never marries her as long as they can be together. Having missed her, too, Harry proposes, and they marry in a traditional Jewish ceremony.\n\nCharlotte, against all the odds, becomes pregnant after [[acupuncture]] therapy but loses the baby very early on. They later go on to adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China, and it is revealed during ''[[Sex and the City: The Movie]]'' that Charlotte later naturally conceives and gives birth to the couple's second daughter, Rose.\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| align = right\n| image1 = Kim Cattrall Meet Monica Velour 2011.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Kim Cattrall]] plays PR business woman [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n| width1 = 200\n| image2 = Cynthia Nixon 2009 portrait.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cynthia Nixon]] plays the role of lawyer [[Miranda Hobbes]]\n| width2 = 200\n}}\n\n===Samantha Jones===\nThe oldest and most sexually confident of the foursome, [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]] ([[Kim Cattrall]]) is an independent businesswoman with a career in public relations (PR). She is confident, strong, and extremely outspoken, and calls herself a \"try-sexual\" (meaning she'll try anything once). Early on in the show, Samantha declares she has given up on relationships and has decided to just have sex \"like a man\", that is: without emotions or feelings, and purely for physical gratification.\n\nSamantha has numerous, extremely brief sexual relationships throughout the show, including a lesbian relationship with an artist named Maria ([[S\u00f4nia Braga]]). This is her first stab at monogamy, but she soon gets bored and goes back to her old ways. Later, she wins the PR business for hotel magnate Richard Wright ([[James Remar]]), who is the male equivalent of herself: good-looking, sexually carefree, and not interested in long-term relationships. She and Richard soon end up together and Samantha feels herself falling for him and is no longer attracted to other men.\n\nFrightened by this, she attempts to hide her feelings but Richard is also falling for her. He pursues her with expensive gifts and romantic gestures, and despite her reluctance, they begin a monogamous relationship. Not long afterward, Samantha becomes suspicious of Richard and catches him cheating on her, which breaks her heart. They reunite not long afterward when Richard apologises, but Samantha develops jealousy and is unable to trust him around other women. She decides to end the relationship before he breaks her heart again.\n\nIn the final season, Samantha seduces young waiter Jerry/Smith Jerrod ([[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]), a much younger struggling actor whose career jump starts thanks to Samantha's PR connections. He mentions being a recovering alcoholic who attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]].\n\nSmith manages to win Samantha's heart thanks to the strength of their physical connection and his patience with her issues with commitment. In the final season, Samantha is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes chemotherapy treatments. She loses her hair, and Smith shaves his head to support her.\n\nThey remain together and, in the first movie, it is revealed that Samantha has moved to Los Angeles with Smith to further his career and become his manager/agent. However, she breaks up with him in the end because she can't adapt to the Californian lifestyle, he becomes too busy at work to spend as much time with her, and she misses being her old self and New York.\n\n===Miranda Hobbes===\n[[Miranda Hobbes]] ([[Cynthia Nixon]]) is a career-minded lawyer with cynical views on relationships and men. A 1990 [[Harvard Law School]] graduate from the Philadelphia area, she is Carrie's confidante and voice of reason. In the early seasons, Miranda is portrayed as distrustful and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] of men, and this is something she struggles with throughout most of the show. Carrie sets up Miranda on a blind date with her geeky friend Skipper, but he is too sweet and passive for Miranda.\n\nMiranda's main relationship is with bartender Steve Brady ([[David Eigenberg]]), whom she meets by chance one night. They have a one-night stand, but Steve pursues Miranda, eventually becoming her boyfriend.\n\nSteve and Miranda have a great relationship, but Steve feels uncomfortable with Miranda's success and money given that he makes a low wage. Things come to a head when Miranda attempts to buy Steve a suit to wear to an event at her law firm. He refuses, maxes out his credit cards to buy it, but then returns it and breaks up with her, saying that she deserves someone who is more on her level.\n\nLater, in season 2, Miranda runs from Steve when she sees him on the street, but he goes to her house to confront her. They start hanging out as friends but eventually end up getting back together, and Steve moves into Miranda's apartment. Steve is keen to move things forward in their relationship by having a baby, but Miranda cites her career as a barrier to this as she is on partner track at her law firm. Instead, they agree to get a puppy, which proves to be a disaster as she feels she is doing all the work, and Steve behaves like an overgrown child. They break up.\n\nSteve takes Miranda's criticisms to heart and later opens his own bar with Carrie's ex Aiden Shaw. Miranda runs into Steve, who tells her about the bar and thanks her for spurring him on. They begin a friendship of sorts.\n\nIn season 4, we discover that Steve has testicular cancer, and Miranda sets out to \"help\" Steve, realizing he doesn't have healthcare. She helps him through his operation and subsequent treatment, and they become close.\n\nSteve confides that he is depressed about losing a testicle. Feeling sorry for him, Miranda has sex with him. Soon afterward, Miranda discovers she is pregnant (something she thought was impossible, as she had been diagnosed with a \"lazy ovary\").\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte is struggling to get pregnant with Trey's baby and is furious when she discovers that Miranda is not only pregnant but is planning to have an abortion. At the clinic with Carrie, Miranda decides she cannot go through with the procedure and decides to keep the baby. She later gives birth to a son whom she names Brady (Steve's last name).\n\nShe and Steve share custody, and raise him with the help of Miranda's hired housekeeper/nanny Magda, an older Ukrainian/Eastern European woman who remains a constant in Miranda's life. The show charts Miranda's struggle as a single, working professional mother and her feelings at losing her old single life.\n\nMiranda later realizes she is still in love with Steve. Unfortunately, before she can confess this to Steve, he announces he has a new girlfriend, Debbie\u2014a much younger girl from his native Queens area of New York. Not wishing to rock the boat, Miranda decides not to tell Steve, and things remain platonic between them.\n\nSoon afterward, a new man moves into Miranda's building: Robert Leeds, an attractive African-American doctor who works for the New York Knicks basketball team. He is divorced, handsome, and makes it clear that he is interested in Miranda. They start a relationship that becomes serious when Robert tells Miranda he loves her (albeit by giving her a giant cookie with the words, \"I Love You\", written on it in chocolate chips).\n\nMiranda feels unable to say it back to him, though,  and in a moment of epiphany at Brady's first birthday party, she blurts out to Steve that she loves him and is sorry for losing him. Steve reassures her that he loves her too, and soon afterward they break up with their respective partners and get back together.\n\nMiranda and Steve decide to marry in a low-key ceremony in a community garden. Living together in Miranda's one-bedroom apartment (in the same building as her now-hostile ex, Robert) proves to be cramped, and they decide to buy a bigger place and eventually move to a house in Brooklyn (much to Miranda's initial dismay).\n\nIn the final episodes of season 6, Miranda and Steve care for Steve's mother Mary, who is suffering from [[dementia]]/[[Alzheimer's]].\n\n===Recurring roles===\n;List of notables recurring roles during series\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin-right:auto\"\n|-\n!Portrayed by\n!Character\n!Notes\n!Recurring seasons\n!Episodes\n!Episode count\n|-\n|[[Chris Noth]]\n|[[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big (John James Preston)]]\n|Carrie's on-again-off-again boyfriend now husband\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[David Eigenberg]]\n|[[Steve Brady|Steven \"Steve\" Brady]]\n|Miranda's boyfriend, now husband\n|2\u20136\n|2.08\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[Willie Garson]]\n|Stanford Blatch\n|Carrie's friend\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.18\n|27\n|-\n|[[Kyle MacLachlan]]\n|Trey MacDougal\n|Charlotte's first husband\n|3\u20134\n|3.07\u20134.18\n|23\n|-\n|[[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]\n|Aidan Shaw\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|3\u20134, 6\n|3.05\u20134.16, 6.01\n|22\n|-\n|[[Evan Handler]]\n|Harry Goldenblatt\n|Charlotte's lawyer and second husband\n|5\u20136\n|5.06\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]\n|Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|6\n|6.02\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Lynn Cohen]]\n|Magda\n|Miranda's housekeeper\n|3\u20136\n|3.03\u20136.20\n|13\n|-\n|[[James Remar]]\n|Richard Wright\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|4\u20135, 6\n|4.10\u20135.03, 6.13\n|12\n|-\n|[[Mario Cantone]]\n|Anthony Marantino\n|Charlotte's wedding planner and friend\n|3\u20136\n|3.11\u20136.20\n|12\n|-\n|[[Frances Sternhagen]]\n|Bunny MacDougal\n|Trey's mother\n|3\u20135\n|3.09\u20135.06\n|10\n|-\n|[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]\n|Aleksandr Petrovsky\n|Carrie's boyfriend, 'The Russian'\n|6\n|6.12\u20136.20\n|9\n|-\n|[[Ron Livingston]]\n|Jack Berger\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.05\u20136.06\n|8\n|-\n|[[Sean Palmer]]\n|Marcus Adant\n|Stanford's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.04\u20136.18\n|8\n|-\n|[[Bridget Moynahan]]\n|Natasha Naginsky\n|Mr. Big's second wife\n|2\u20133\n|2.17\u20133.17\n|7\n|-\n|[[Ben Weber (actor)|Ben Weber]]\n|Skipper Johnston\n|Miranda's boyfriend\n|1\u20132\n|1.01\u20132.14\n|7\n|-\n|[[Blair Underwood]]\n|Dr. Robert E.

At a birthday party for Miranda, Carrie and her friends decide to start having sex \"like men\", meaning without emotional attachment. However, she realizes she cannot after getting brushed off by a man she has sex with one time later.\n\nCarrie has many chance encounters with a handsome businessman whom Samantha refers to as \"Mr. Big\". They begin to date, but Carrie is dismayed to find out he is still seeing other people. Although he eventually agrees to exclusivity, he doesn't introduce Carrie to his mother and won't refer to her as \"the one\", so rather than going on a planned vacation with him, Carrie breaks it off.\n\nCarrie sets up Miranda with her friend Skipper. Miranda and he date on and off; he is more laid back while Miranda is more forceful. After they break up, Miranda sees him with another woman and feels compelled to resume their relationship, but they again break up when he wants exclusivity and she does not.\n\nCharlotte dates a marriage-minded man but they clash over china patterns. She declines to have anal sex with another boyfriend and also consents to pose nude for a famous painter.\n\nSamantha sleeps with an artist who likes to videotape his encounters, with Charlotte's doorman, with a married couple, and with others. When she meets James, who seems utterly perfect for her, she's heartbroken to discover that he has an extremely small penis.\n\n===Season 2 (1999)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 2)}}\nCarrie dates a baseball player while on the rebound but breaks it off when she realizes she's not over Big. She then dates a sell-out filmmaker, a shoplifter, and a nice guy she scares away by snooping, and then takes up with Big again. She at first keeps this from her friends. Her and Big's relationship is rocky, and when he announces that he might have to move to Paris for a year but doesn't overtly invite Carrie to come with him, they break up a second time. Carrie then tries without success to convert a friend-with-benefits to something more, dates a writer with a great family but who is always \"early\" in bed, and then a recovering alcoholic who uses Carrie to replace his old addiction. She then runs into Big, returned from Paris, and his new 20-something fianc\u00e9e, Natasha (played by [[Bridget Moynahan]]).\n\nMiranda dates a dirty talker, fakes it with an ophthalmologist, and tries to adjust to a guy who likes to watch porn during sex. By the time she meets Steve, the bartender, she's unwilling to believe he is as nice as he seems. They start dating but the differences in their schedules and their finances lead to a breakup. She winds up back in bed with Steve, but not before dating a guy who wants to get caught, a Peeping Tom in the next building, and a divorced dad.\n\nCharlotte encounters a legendary purveyor of cunnilingus, a handy actor next door, a widower on the make, a man who undergoes adult circumcision, a famous actor, a too-effeminate pastry chef, a shoe salesman with a foot fetish, and a 20-something guy who gives her crabs.\n\nDespite a brief attempt at couples therapy, Samantha breaks up with James. She then sleeps with a litigator, a salsa dancer, her personal trainer, a sports fan who can only rally when his team does well, and Charlotte's brother. She then meets a man whose penis is too big even for her.\n\nThe end of Season two also marks the end of characters' [[Fourth wall|talking directly to the camera]].\n\n===Season 3 (2000)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 3)}}\nCarrie starts off dating a politician, followed by a [[bisexual]] person. Big marries Natasha, and Carrie meets Aidan, a furniture maker. They have a virtually flaw-free relationship until Carrie and Big begin an affair. When Natasha catches Carrie in Natasha and Big's apartment, Carrie and Big's affair ends as do eventually both Big's marriage and Carrie's relationship with Aidan.\n\nMiranda and Steve move in together. He tells Miranda he'd like them to have a baby, but a puppy purchase instead alerts Miranda to the fact that they're very different when it comes to maturity. Steve moves out and Miranda makes partner at her law firm. She also goes on to date a phone sex guy, a fake ER doctor, a guy who doesn't swallow his food, and a police detective.\n\nCharlotte, looking for a husband, dates an investment banker with an anger management problem, a photographer who gets her into menswear, a bad kisser, and a climax name caller. She then meets Trey MacDougal; despite an awkward \"proposal\", the discovery of his low libido and inability to perform sexually the night before their marriage, and conflict with his domineering mother, the two marry. They begin their marriage with a sexless honeymoon, and as sex remains an ongoing problem in their relationship, the two eventually separate.\n\nSamantha sleeps with a firefighter, a short man, her assistant, a black guy with a disapproving sister, a recreational [[Viagra]] user, a guy who tastes bad, Trey's Scottish cousin, a [[dildo]] model, and a college-aged virgin. She also has a [[menopause]] scare, gets tested for HIV, and buys a new apartment in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], where she has to make peace with the [[transgender women]] on her street.\n\nAfter Carrie's break-ups with Big and Aidan, she dates a guy who still lives at home, teaches a class at the [[Learning Annex]] on how to meet men, gets mugged, and tries to apologize to Natasha. She and Big also make an attempt at being friends.\n\n===Season 4 (2001\u201302)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 4)}}\nAfter a chance meeting with Aidan at the opening of a bar he co-owns, Carrie convinces him to restart their relationship. He moves into her apartment after purchasing it when her building goes [[co-op]] and then proposes. Despite her misgivings, Carrie accepts the proposal and then eventually realizes she's not ready for marriage. Despite discussing her concerns and initially agreeing to give her more time, Aidan soon pressures Carrie for marriage. She realizes this is because he does not trust her, given her past affair with Big. They break up and he moves out, and Carrie purchases her apartment after Charlotte lends her the down payment in the form of the engagement ring she received from Trey. At the end of Season Four, Carrie discovers that Big has sold his apartment and is moving to [[Napa, California]].\n\nCharlotte and Trey are living apart but continuing to have marital relations; they eventually reconcile and Charlotte moves back into their shared apartment. They decide to try for a baby but realize Charlotte is reproductively challenged; after [[fertility]] treatments and discussing adoption, their marriage breaks apart under the strain and they decide to divorce.\n\nMiranda supports Steve through [[testicular cancer]] and surgery. Later, when he feels emasculated by the surgery, they have sex and Miranda gets pregnant. She initially considers an abortion, which is particularly distressing to Charlotte, as she deals with her struggles to get pregnant, but Miranda decides to keep the baby.\n\nSamantha flirts with a priest, has nude photos taken of herself, tries to have a relationship with a lesbian, and sleeps with a baby talker, a wrestling coach, and a farmer. She then lands a big PR account with resolutely single hotel magnate Richard Wright. They begin a relationship that starts out as purely sexual but becomes something more to both of them, and they attempt [[monogamy]]. However, she eventually catches him cheating, and they break up.\n\n===Season 5 (2002)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 5)}}\nCarrie spends time by herself in Season Five; she fears this means she will be fired from writing her sex column, but instead a publisher wants to turn the columns into a book. A book tour lands her in San Francisco, where she reunites briefly with Big. In New York, she meets Jack Berger, a fellow author with whom she feels sparks, but who is attached.\n\nSamantha tries again with Richard but finds herself constantly paranoid. On a trip to Atlantic City with Richard and the girls, she cannot overcome her lack of trust in him and breaks it off for good.\n\nMiranda is now mother to son Brady and finds it difficult to work, date, and carry on her previous lifestyle. Steve is supportive, and she falls into bed with him one afternoon, making her question her feelings for him.\n\nCharlotte has a run-in with her former mother-in-law over the legalities of the apartment she shared with Trey, and she hires Harry Goldenblatt as her divorce attorney. Despite his physical shortcomings she finds herself attracted to him, and they begin a sexual relationship. She soon finds that she is developing real feelings for him. Harry, however, reveals that he must marry within his Jewish faith, causing Charlotte to actually consider conversion.\n\n===Season 6 (2003\u201304)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 6)}}\nCarrie begins dating Jack Berger, who is termed her best 'mental match' of all her relationships. However, his struggles as an author and her success with her upcoming book cause too much conflict between them, and they break up. Big returns to New York for [[angioplasty]], and Carrie realizes she still has feelings for him; she also realizes he still cannot fully commit. After he returns to Napa, she meets Aleksandr, a famous Russian artist. Aleksandr seems to be attentive to her in a way that Big never was, and he asks her to come to Paris with him. She does, briefly, but realizes how inattentive he is when working, and she breaks it off with him just as Big arrives in Paris, looking for her, ready to finally commit to her being \"the one\".\n\nCharlotte decides that life with Harry, who accepts her fertility issues, would be worth converting to Judaism. After this process, she presses Harry to \"set the date\" in an insulting way and he breaks it off with her. However, they run into each other at a mixer and, after her tearful apology, rekindle their relationship and eventually marry. After fertility treatments fail, they decide to adopt, and eventually learn they have been approved to adopt a child from China.\n\nOnce Miranda realizes she's still in love with Steve, he begins a serious relationship with someone else (Debbie), and so she does the same with Robert (played by Blair Underwood). However, at their son Brady's first birthday party, they reveal their feelings for each other and renew their relationship. Miranda proposes to Steve and they marry in a community park. Needing more room for their growing family, she consents to moving to [[Brooklyn]], where they buy a brownstone. After Steve's mother Mary (played by [[Anne Meara]]) is revealed to have suffered a stroke and subsequent memory loss, she moves in with the couple.\n\nSamantha begins a relationship with a much younger waiter, Jerry Jerrod, who turns out to be a struggling actor. She uses her PR skills to help his career, even changing his name to Smith Jerrod. Despite trying to keep their relationship as casual as her others, she develops true feelings for him. Smith supports her after she is diagnosed with breast cancer, shaving his own head in sympathy after catching her shaving her head when [[chemotherapy]] makes her hair fall out. He also insists on waiting for her when her treatment diminishes her sex drive. When he flies home from his movie shoot just to tell her that he loves her, she replies, \"You have meant more to me than any man I've ever known.\"\n\nThe season and the series concludes with the four girlfriends reunited in New York City, and with Carrie receiving a phone call from Big (which finally reveals his first name, John), telling her that his Napa house is up for sale and he is headed back to New York. Carrie's final voiceover states: \"The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the you ''you'' love, well, that's just fabulous.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''Sex and the City'' premiered on [[HBO]], June 6, 1998, and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms of the season.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=ed. by Kim Akass & Janet|title=Reading Sex and the City|date=2004|publisher=I.B.

The first clue is in the opening credits of the television show. Carrie is standing in a New York street in a ballet skirt, the sort that toddlers wear. She is dressed, unmistakably, as a child. And, because she is sex columnist on a newspaper, a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past. 'Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex,' says the bus. And there, before any dialogue hits your ears, you have the two woeful female archetypes that ''Sex and the City'' loves\u2014woman as sex object and woman as child ...

The show uses voiceovers to reveal Carrie's inner thought life, which is often in conflict with how she is expressing herself externally. As pop culture expert Ashli L. Dykes points out, \"... [the] fear that men will no longer find a woman attractive if she reveals her true self is in contrast to the relationships among the four main female characters...\"<ref>Dykes, Ashli L. \"'And I Started Wondering....\": Voiceover and Conversation in 'Sex and the City.'\" Studies in Popular Culture, vol. 34, no. 1, 2011, pp. 49\u201366.

Some argue whatever label is applied to the show, it offered an important contribution \"to ongoing dialogue\"<ref>Hermes, Joke (2002). \"Television and Its Viewers in Post-Feminist Dialogue Internet-mediated Response to 'Ally McBeal' and 'Sex and the City'\". ''Ethnofoor''. p. 1.</ref> and that because it \"shows women in a world where they can be feminine, attractive, and feminist at the same time ... the series gives a forum to a renewed postfeminist debate.\"<ref>Adriaens, Fien and Sofie Van Bauwel (2011). \"Sex and the City: A Postfeminist Point of View? Or How Popular Culture Functions as a Channel for Feminist Discourse\". The Journal of Popular Culture, p. 18.</ref>\n\nAndrea Press criticised the show for how it handled topics such as unexpected pregnancy, stating that it contrasts with feminist progressive thought. In one episode, Miranda is faced with an unexpected pregnancy, which causes Carrie to reflect on her own experience of pregnancy and abortion. Press argued that Carrie's shame when sharing this story with her boyfriend serves to \"undermine\" the hard-fought freedoms that allowed her choice with \"multiple critical perspectives toward the act\"<ref name=\"jstor.org\">Press, Andrea. \"Gender and Family in Televisions Golden Age and Beyond.\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 625, 2009, pp. 139\u2013150.

Until then, Nussbaum writes, ''Sex and the City'' \"was sharp, iconoclastic television.\" In answer to the question of why the show is now \"so often portrayed as a set of empty, static cartoons, an embarrassment to womankind,\" Nussbaum wrote: \"It's a classic misunderstanding, I think, stemming from an unexamined hierarchy: the assumption that anything stylized (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.\" Nussbaum also pushed against criticism of ''Sex and the City'' as anti-feminist, arguing for a more complex view of the characters as situated within different waves of feminism: \"Miranda and Carrie were [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]], who believed in egalitarianism; Charlotte and Samantha were [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave feminists]], focused on exploiting the power of femininity, from opposing angles.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Nussbaum | first= Emily | title= How \"Sex and the City\" Lost its Good Name| newspaper = The New Yorker| date= July 29, 2013| url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2013/07/29/130729crte_television_nussbaum?currentPage=all | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA 2018 article in [[The Guardian]] entitled \"'That show was as white as it gets!': Sex and the City's problematic legacy\", pointed to the lack of any non-white series regulars and \"racial insensitivities\" in the show like Carrie's \"ghetto gold\" reference or Samantha's wearing an [[afro]] wig to cover her baldness from [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=\"Ellen E.

Television Distribution]]. [[CBS Television Studios]] (successors to [[Rysher Entertainment]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]) and their [[CBS Television Distribution|distribution arm]] own international rights. The series was filmed with traditional broadcast syndication in mind during its run, and pre-planned scenes with different dialogue and content were created specifically for syndication, along with appropriate cuts of each episode to fit a 22-minute timeslot which includes advertising.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2003/09/30/tbs-gets-syndicated-sanitized-sex-and-city/|title=TBS gets syndicated, sanitized ''Sex and the City''|last=Susman|first=Gary|date=30 September 2003|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nThe United States cable channel [[HBO]] was the original broadcaster; [[HBO Go]]/[[HBO Now]] continue to carry the original run of the entire series as originally aired. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[WGN America]] were the first US channels to syndicate the show and utilize the secondary syndicated cut of the series; it also aired on broadcast stations for several seasons. As of 2019, [[E!]] continues to broadcast the syndicated version of the series.\n\n====Canada====\nIn Canada cable channel Bravo aired the first run of the show every Saturday at 11:00 PM, a few weeks behind the U.S. HBO broadcast (the series pre-dated the 2008 existence of [[HBO Canada]]).\n\n====Australia====\nIn Australia, the [[Nine Network]] aired the first run of the show every Monday between 9:30&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. After 2004 the cable channel [[W. Channel|W]] aired it until summer 2008 when [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]] started airing it in a block with ''[[Will & Grace]]'' with promos stating \"all the good guys are gay\". The series was repeated on [[Network Ten]] from 2005 to 2010, and on Eleven (later known today as [[10 Peach]]) from February 2011. It currently airs in syndication on the cable channel Fox Showcase and occasionally plays marathons on the cable channel Binge, which plays back-to-back episodes of several TV shows.\n\n====Ireland====\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] premiered ''Sex and the City'' in February 1999.

They have been released officially in region 1 (Americas), region 2 (Europe & Middle East), region 3 (Korea), and region 4 (Oceania & South Pacific) formats. In addition to their region encoding, releases vary depending on the region in which they were released.\n\nIn addition to standard single-season DVD box sets of the show, limited edition collectors' editions have been released that include all six seasons in one complete set. These also vary among regions (and the regions are defined differently). While Europe got a complete set that came with special \"shoebox\" packaging (a reference to [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s love for shoes), the USA and Canada version came packaged in a more traditional fold-out suede case and with an additional bonus DVD that includes many special features. Mexico and Oceania's edition come packaged in a beauty case.\n\nAs well as missing out on some special features, many in Europe had trouble with the region 2 edition of the season 1 DVD. The season was not converted into a [[PAL]] video signal; it instead remained in its original American [[NTSC]] format, which caused compatibility problems with some European television sets and DVD players. All subsequent [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD releases of the program were appropriately transferred to [[PAL]] video using the original film prints, and season 1 has since been re-released in PAL format.\n\nOutside the US, ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets were released through [[Paramount Pictures]]. American and Canadian DVDs were released through the program's original broadcasters, [[HBO]]. In Australia, single editions have been released, wherein each disc is sold separately. In [[South Korea]], complete, six-season, special DVD shoebox sets were released. In Brazil, the first and fifth seasons were released on DVD Dual, but all other seasons were released in DVD [[box sets]].\n\nSelected episodes are also available as part of the ''Sex and the City Essentials'' DVD collection. These are four separately-packaged discs containing three selected episodes that fit a common theme.\n* ''The Best of Lust'': Contains the episodes \"The Fuck Buddy\", \"Running with Scissors\", and \"The Turtle and the Hare\".\n* ''The Best of Mr. Big'': Contains the episodes \"Sex and the City\", \"Ex and the City\", and \"I Heart NY\".\n* ''The Best of Romance'': Contains the episodes \"Baby, Talk is Cheap\", \"Hop, Skip and a Week\", and \"An American Girl in Paris (Part Deux)\".\n* ''The Best of Breakups'': Contains the episodes \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", \"I Love a Charade\", and \"The Post-it Always Sticks Twice\".\n* ''The Best of Fashion'': Contains the episodes \"Secret Sex\", \"The Real Me\", and \"Luck Be an Old Lady\". This DVD was only released to Target stores in the US and was the only DVD of the \"Essentials\" collection to have a colored cover instead of a black and white one like the other four.\n\n==Soundtrack releases==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nTwo digital CDs (the albums from [[Irma Records]]) contain tracks used in the show's actual soundtrack.\n* '''''[[Sex and the City: Music from the HBO Series|Sex and the City \u2013 Soundtrack]]''''' [Import]\n:2000/2001/2002\n:[[Sire Records]]\n:Includes the main theme from the show, written by [[Douglas J.

Throughout its development, the series received contributions from various producers, screenwriters, and directors, principally [[Michael Patrick King]].\n\nSet and filmed in [[New York City]], the show follows the lives of a group of four women\u2014three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties\u2014who, despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other. Starring [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] (as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]) and co-starring [[Kim Cattrall]] (as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]), [[Kristin Davis]] (as [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]]), and [[Cynthia Nixon]] (as [[Miranda Hobbes]]), the series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[safe sex]], [[promiscuity]], and [[femininity]], while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life\u2014from sex to relationships\u2014through each of their four very different, individual perspectives.\n\n''Sex and the City'' has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network.<ref>Nussbaum, Emily (July 29, 2013). \"[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women Difficult Women: How \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 Lost its Good Name]\".

It spawned two feature films, ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'' (2008) and ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' (2010), and a [[prequel]] television series commissioned by [[The CW]], ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'' (2013\u20132014).\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe show was based in part on writer [[Candace Bushnell]]'s 1997 [[Sex and the City (book)|book of the same name]], compiled from her column at ''[[The New York Observer]]''. Bushnell has said in several interviews that the [[Carrie Bradshaw]] in her columns is her [[alter ego]]; when she wrote the \"Sex and the City\" essays, she used her own name initially, but for privacy reasons, later created the character played in the series by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. Carrie Bradshaw was a writer living in New York City. Carrie Bradshaw and Candace Bushnell have the same initials, a flourish emphasizing their connection. Moreover, just as Carrie Bradshaw has articles for the fictional ''New York Star'' published as a book in later series, the entire ''Sex and the City'' series is based on a compilation of Bushnell's own columns for the ''New York Observer''.\n\n''Sex and the City'' creator [[Darren Star]] wrote the pilot with Parker in mind as Carrie. According to Parker, \"I was flattered but didn't want to do it. He convinced me, begged me to do it, and I signed a contract.\"<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/entertainment/feature/022706feature.htm|title=365gay.com|work=Sarah Jessica Parker|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323111952/http://www.365gay.com/entertainment/feature/022706feature.htm|archivedate=March 23, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 16, 2006|df=mdy-all}} available at the</ref> The pilot episode was subsequently shot in June 1997, a year before the series premiered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Karla |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sex-and-the-city-darren-star-offered-kristin-davis-carrie-role/ |title='Sex and the City\u2019 Boss Darren Star Offered Kristin Davis the Role of Carrie |publisher=Usmagazine.com |date=2018-05-07 |accessdate=2019-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/au/news/939792/hair-changes-nudity-clauses-and-sarah-jessica-parker-s-reluctance-how-sex-and-the-city-painstakingly-came-together |title=Hair Changes, Nudity Clauses and Sarah Jessica Parker's Reluctance: How Sex and the City Painstakingly Came Together &#124; E!

Though Star would not release her, he listened to her concerns and implemented major changes before shooting the first season. Parker said: \"The funny thing, after the first episode of season one, I never looked back and the rest is history. I never thought, though, that the show would become what it has become.\"<ref name=\"tv\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Sex and the City characters}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|align     = left\n|image1    = Sarah Jessica Parker at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival 3.jpg\n|caption1  = Columnist [[Carrie Bradshaw]] is played by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]\n|width1    = 200\n|image2    = Kristindavis1999.jpg\n|caption2  = Art dealer and housewife [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt]] is played by [[Kristin Davis]]\n|width2    = 200\n}}\n\n===Carrie Bradshaw===\n[[Carrie Bradshaw]] ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) is the narrator and main protagonist, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, with each episode structured around her train of thought while writing her weekly column \"Sex and the City\" for the fictitious paper, the ''New York Star.'' A member of the New York glitterati, she is a [[Nightclub|club]]/bar/restaurant staple known for her unique fashion sense and lives in a studio apartment in an [[Upper East Side]] [[brownstone]]. Stanford Blatch, a gay talent agent from an aristocratic family (played by [[Willie Garson]]), is Carrie's best friend outside of the other three women.\n\nCarrie is entangled with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]] ([[Chris Noth]]), a prominent businessman and an aficionado of jazz and cigars whose real name is revealed in the final episode (Season 6, Episode 8) to be John James Preston, in a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. (In a running joke, whenever Carrie is about to introduce Mr. Big on-camera to another character, she is interrupted before she can say his name.) He is the reason for many of Carrie's breakdowns as he never seems ready to fully commit to her. He is once-divorced by the time the series opens.\n\nCarrie and Big break up when he leaves New York for a work secondment to Paris and does not show willingness for Carrie to accompany him nor to continue a long-distance relationship, citing commitment issues. Carrie is heartbroken and some months later runs into Big at a party in the Hamptons. He is accompanied by his 20-something year-old girlfriend, Natasha, whom he met in Paris. Despite this, Carrie attempts to be friends with Big. However, this goes awry when he tells her that he and Natasha are getting married, something he'd never considered with Carrie.\n\nIn season 3, Carrie meets and is instantly attracted to up-and-coming [[Manhattan]] furniture designer Aidan Shaw ([[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]) who becomes her boyfriend. Aidan is more traditional and patient about relationships than many of Carrie's other love interests, and for a while they are happy together. At a furniture show, the pair run into Natasha and Big, who confides to Carrie that he made a mistake marrying Natasha and wants out. Soon afterward, Big and Carrie begin an affair, which ends only when Natasha catches Carrie at Big's apartment.\n\nWracked with guilt, Carrie tells Aidan of the affair on the day of Charlotte's wedding to Trey, and Aidan breaks up with her. Aidan and Carrie reunite in Season 4, when Aidan opens a bar with Miranda's ex, Steve. Carrie realizes she is still in love with Aidan and wins him back. He struggles to trust her, particularly as Mr. Big has gotten divorced from Natasha, and he and Carrie maintain a platonic friendship. Carrie stands firm on her friendship with Big, even inviting him up to Aidan's cabin after a girl had broken up with him.\n\nWhen Carrie's building goes co-op, Aidan offers to buy her apartment (and the one next door) so they can move in together. She agrees and later finds an engagement ring in his gym bag. Aidan later proposes, and Carrie accepts.\n\nAidan is initially patient with Carrie's reluctance to set a wedding date but soon begins to push her, suggesting they get married in Hawaii. Carrie has a panic attack whilst trying on wedding dresses with Miranda, and again when Aidan is knocking down the wall between her apartment and the one next door. She confesses to Aidan that she's not ready and needs more time. He agrees to slow things down but, at a Black and White ball not long afterward, he pressures her to commit, making it clear that he still doesn't trust she's over Big. Carrie cannot commit, and they break up soon afterward.\n\nThe famous artist Aleksandr Petrovsky ([[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]) becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. Despite their age difference, he sweeps her off her feet with huge romantic gestures and shows her foreign pockets of New York she has never seen before.\n\nCarrie also makes plans to move to [[Paris]] with Aleksandr for his work. The rest of the women are not keen on Aleksandr, particularly Miranda, who feels that he is controlling and that Carrie is different around him.\n\nOn the night before Carrie leaves, Mr. Big turns up at her home. The two argue in the street with Carrie accusing him of turning up whenever she's happy to ruin things for her. She tells him to leave her alone.\n\nWhen Carrie arrives in Paris, she finds Aleksandr frequently absent with work on his art show. She is left to wander the streets of Paris alone day after day and begins to regret her decision. She confides in Miranda during a phone conversation that she is lonely and that Aleks is neglecting her.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, Charlotte hears a message Mr. Big leaves Carrie on her answering machine admitting that he loves her. Charlotte invites Big to the coffee shop where he enlists the help of Carrie's friends, asking if they think he has a chance. Miranda, armed with the information from Carrie, simply says, \"Go get our girl\", and Big goes to Paris to win her back.\n\nCarrie, having once again been abandoned by Aleksandr (having given up the opportunity to go to a party with some new friends to accompany him to a preview of his show), has it out with him in their hotel room. Aleksandr smacks Carrie in the face and breaks her diamond necklace.\n\nAs Carrie is in the lobby, trying to obtain a room for the night, Big walks in. They see each other, he tells her she's \"the one\" (something she's been waiting for their entire relationship), and he takes her home to New York.\n\n===Charlotte York===\n[[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]] ([[Kristin Davis]]) has had a conventional, privileged [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Connecticut]] upbringing and works in an art gallery. Charlotte is a classic over-achiever and perfectionist: a \"straight A\" student who attended [[Smith College]], where she was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] (note that there are no sororities at the real Smith College) majoring in art history with a minor in finance. During the series, it is also revealed that Charlotte was voted [[homecoming]] queen, [[prom]] queen, \"most popular\", student body president, and track team captain, in addition to being an active cheerleader and teen model.\n\nShe is the [[antithesis]] of Samantha: optimistic, hopelessly romantic, and a believer in true love and soul mates. She places the most emphasis on emotional love as opposed to lust. From the beginning, Charlotte is searching for her \"[[knight in shining armor]]\", and nothing shakes her belief of finding \"the one\", getting married, and starting a family. All her dating activity during the show is in pursuit of a long-term, monogamous boyfriend with a view to marriage. As such, she typically dates men of \"pedigree\" and money (bankers, doctors, lawyers, etc.).\n\nCharlotte can be a dark horse, and we learn that she once had a dalliance with an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish artist, she dressed in drag for a portrait, and she allowed an artist to paint a picture of her [[vulva]]. She can be an \"East Side Princess\" sometimes, and she and Samantha occasionally come to blows over their differing opinions about love and sex.\n\nIn season 3, Charlotte decides she will be married that year and sets about canvassing her married friends to set her up on dates. One married friend usurps her blind date to try and start an affair with her. Horrified, she dashes into the street and trips in front of a taxi, carrying Trey MacDougal ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), an attractive, old-money, Scottish-American cardiologist with pedigree, a [[Park Avenue]] apartment and country estate in Connecticut. They fall in love at first sight, and he appears to be everything she has always wanted. Things move quickly and Charlotte, convinced he is the one, suggests they marry. He agrees, and they are married very shortly afterward (with the help of wedding planner Anthony Marentino; a gay Sicilian who is as forceful as Charlotte is timid).\n\nWishing to \"do things the right way\", Charlotte has withheld having sex with Trey, hoping for a romantic and traditional wedding night. On the evening before the big day, she gets drunk with the other women and goes to Trey for sex. Unfortunately, it does not go well; Trey reveals he suffers from [[impotence]].\n\nWhile concerned, Charlotte presses ahead with the wedding, although she confides in Carrie just before walking down the aisle. As the marriage begins things do not get any better in their intimate relationship, and Trey refuses to address matters either physically or psychologically, resisting their marriage counselor's advice. Matters are not helped by Trey's overbearing mother Bunny ([[Frances Sternhagen]]), a manipulative sort who intrudes on Trey and Charlotte's relationship and apartment on a regular basis. Not long into the marriage, on a weekend trip to the MacDougal country estate, Charlotte is caught in a clinch with the hunky gardener and this seals the fate of her marriage to Trey. Trey and Charlotte separate, and she moves back into her old apartment.\n\nWhile separated, Charlotte and Trey mend their sexual relationship and get back together. All seems to be well, and Charlotte resumes living with Trey. To mark a new beginning and letting go of Bunny's control, she redecorates the apartment, and the couple decides to create a baby room and try for a baby. Having no luck, Charlotte seeks fertility treatment and is told she has a very low chance of becoming pregnant. Seeking other options, she begins hormone injections and looks into adopting a Chinese baby girl.\n\nA combination of these factors once again ignites old tensions with Trey and Bunny, culminating in Trey's deciding he no longer wants a family. This blow to her hopes and dreams proves too much for Charlotte, and she finishes the marriage once and for all.\n\nWhen Charlotte's marriage ends, she meets Harry Goldenblatt ([[Evan Handler]]), her Jewish divorce lawyer, at the beginning of season 5. She is not attracted to him initially but, spurred on by Anthony, she starts a purely physical relationship with Harry. Harry is the opposite of Trey: short, bald, hairy, uncouth but funny, passionate, and attentive. Their sexual relationship is fulfilling, and eventually they begin dating properly. However, Harry says he cannot be serious with Charlotte because she isn't a Jew.\n\nBelieving Harry to be her future, Charlotte converts to Judaism and this sees her struggle with losing her Christian faith and ideologies including Christmas and Easter. After her conversion, Charlotte celebrates her first [[Shabbat]] with Harry but loses her temper when he appears to not appreciate all her efforts. The row quickly evolves into Charlotte's badgering Harry to propose and, feeling pressured, he storms out, and they break up.\n\nCharlotte is heartbroken. Some time later, at a singles event at the [[synagogue]], she bumps into Harry. She tells him she loves him and doesn't care if he never marries her as long as they can be together. Having missed her, too, Harry proposes, and they marry in a traditional Jewish ceremony.\n\nCharlotte, against all the odds, becomes pregnant after [[acupuncture]] therapy but loses the baby very early on. They later go on to adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China, and it is revealed during ''[[Sex and the City: The Movie]]'' that Charlotte later naturally conceives and gives birth to the couple's second daughter, Rose.\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| align = right\n| image1 = Kim Cattrall Meet Monica Velour 2011.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Kim Cattrall]] plays PR business woman [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n| width1 = 200\n| image2 = Cynthia Nixon 2009 portrait.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cynthia Nixon]] plays the role of lawyer [[Miranda Hobbes]]\n| width2 = 200\n}}\n\n===Samantha Jones===\nThe oldest and most sexually confident of the foursome, [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]] ([[Kim Cattrall]]) is an independent businesswoman with a career in public relations (PR). She is confident, strong, and extremely outspoken, and calls herself a \"try-sexual\" (meaning she'll try anything once). Early on in the show, Samantha declares she has given up on relationships and has decided to just have sex \"like a man\", that is: without emotions or feelings, and purely for physical gratification.\n\nSamantha has numerous, extremely brief sexual relationships throughout the show, including a lesbian relationship with an artist named Maria ([[S\u00f4nia Braga]]). This is her first stab at monogamy, but she soon gets bored and goes back to her old ways. Later, she wins the PR business for hotel magnate Richard Wright ([[James Remar]]), who is the male equivalent of herself: good-looking, sexually carefree, and not interested in long-term relationships. She and Richard soon end up together and Samantha feels herself falling for him and is no longer attracted to other men.\n\nFrightened by this, she attempts to hide her feelings but Richard is also falling for her. He pursues her with expensive gifts and romantic gestures, and despite her reluctance, they begin a monogamous relationship. Not long afterward, Samantha becomes suspicious of Richard and catches him cheating on her, which breaks her heart. They reunite not long afterward when Richard apologises, but Samantha develops jealousy and is unable to trust him around other women. She decides to end the relationship before he breaks her heart again.\n\nIn the final season, Samantha seduces young waiter Jerry/Smith Jerrod ([[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]), a much younger struggling actor whose career jump starts thanks to Samantha's PR connections. He mentions being a recovering alcoholic who attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]].\n\nSmith manages to win Samantha's heart thanks to the strength of their physical connection and his patience with her issues with commitment. In the final season, Samantha is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes chemotherapy treatments. She loses her hair, and Smith shaves his head to support her.\n\nThey remain together and, in the first movie, it is revealed that Samantha has moved to Los Angeles with Smith to further his career and become his manager/agent. However, she breaks up with him in the end because she can't adapt to the Californian lifestyle, he becomes too busy at work to spend as much time with her, and she misses being her old self and New York.\n\n===Miranda Hobbes===\n[[Miranda Hobbes]] ([[Cynthia Nixon]]) is a career-minded lawyer with cynical views on relationships and men. A 1990 [[Harvard Law School]] graduate from the Philadelphia area, she is Carrie's confidante and voice of reason. In the early seasons, Miranda is portrayed as distrustful and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] of men, and this is something she struggles with throughout most of the show. Carrie sets up Miranda on a blind date with her geeky friend Skipper, but he is too sweet and passive for Miranda.\n\nMiranda's main relationship is with bartender Steve Brady ([[David Eigenberg]]), whom she meets by chance one night. They have a one-night stand, but Steve pursues Miranda, eventually becoming her boyfriend.\n\nSteve and Miranda have a great relationship, but Steve feels uncomfortable with Miranda's success and money given that he makes a low wage. Things come to a head when Miranda attempts to buy Steve a suit to wear to an event at her law firm. He refuses, maxes out his credit cards to buy it, but then returns it and breaks up with her, saying that she deserves someone who is more on her level.\n\nLater, in season 2, Miranda runs from Steve when she sees him on the street, but he goes to her house to confront her. They start hanging out as friends but eventually end up getting back together, and Steve moves into Miranda's apartment. Steve is keen to move things forward in their relationship by having a baby, but Miranda cites her career as a barrier to this as she is on partner track at her law firm. Instead, they agree to get a puppy, which proves to be a disaster as she feels she is doing all the work, and Steve behaves like an overgrown child. They break up.\n\nSteve takes Miranda's criticisms to heart and later opens his own bar with Carrie's ex Aiden Shaw. Miranda runs into Steve, who tells her about the bar and thanks her for spurring him on. They begin a friendship of sorts.\n\nIn season 4, we discover that Steve has testicular cancer, and Miranda sets out to \"help\" Steve, realizing he doesn't have healthcare. She helps him through his operation and subsequent treatment, and they become close.\n\nSteve confides that he is depressed about losing a testicle. Feeling sorry for him, Miranda has sex with him. Soon afterward, Miranda discovers she is pregnant (something she thought was impossible, as she had been diagnosed with a \"lazy ovary\").\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte is struggling to get pregnant with Trey's baby and is furious when she discovers that Miranda is not only pregnant but is planning to have an abortion. At the clinic with Carrie, Miranda decides she cannot go through with the procedure and decides to keep the baby. She later gives birth to a son whom she names Brady (Steve's last name).\n\nShe and Steve share custody, and raise him with the help of Miranda's hired housekeeper/nanny Magda, an older Ukrainian/Eastern European woman who remains a constant in Miranda's life. The show charts Miranda's struggle as a single, working professional mother and her feelings at losing her old single life.\n\nMiranda later realizes she is still in love with Steve. Unfortunately, before she can confess this to Steve, he announces he has a new girlfriend, Debbie\u2014a much younger girl from his native Queens area of New York. Not wishing to rock the boat, Miranda decides not to tell Steve, and things remain platonic between them.\n\nSoon afterward, a new man moves into Miranda's building: Robert Leeds, an attractive African-American doctor who works for the New York Knicks basketball team. He is divorced, handsome, and makes it clear that he is interested in Miranda. They start a relationship that becomes serious when Robert tells Miranda he loves her (albeit by giving her a giant cookie with the words, \"I Love You\", written on it in chocolate chips).\n\nMiranda feels unable to say it back to him, though,  and in a moment of epiphany at Brady's first birthday party, she blurts out to Steve that she loves him and is sorry for losing him. Steve reassures her that he loves her too, and soon afterward they break up with their respective partners and get back together.\n\nMiranda and Steve decide to marry in a low-key ceremony in a community garden. Living together in Miranda's one-bedroom apartment (in the same building as her now-hostile ex, Robert) proves to be cramped, and they decide to buy a bigger place and eventually move to a house in Brooklyn (much to Miranda's initial dismay).\n\nIn the final episodes of season 6, Miranda and Steve care for Steve's mother Mary, who is suffering from [[dementia]]/[[Alzheimer's]].\n\n===Recurring roles===\n;List of notables recurring roles during series\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin-right:auto\"\n|-\n!Portrayed by\n!Character\n!Notes\n!Recurring seasons\n!Episodes\n!Episode count\n|-\n|[[Chris Noth]]\n|[[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big (John James Preston)]]\n|Carrie's on-again-off-again boyfriend now husband\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[David Eigenberg]]\n|[[Steve Brady|Steven \"Steve\" Brady]]\n|Miranda's boyfriend, now husband\n|2\u20136\n|2.08\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[Willie Garson]]\n|Stanford Blatch\n|Carrie's friend\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.18\n|27\n|-\n|[[Kyle MacLachlan]]\n|Trey MacDougal\n|Charlotte's first husband\n|3\u20134\n|3.07\u20134.18\n|23\n|-\n|[[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]\n|Aidan Shaw\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|3\u20134, 6\n|3.05\u20134.16, 6.01\n|22\n|-\n|[[Evan Handler]]\n|Harry Goldenblatt\n|Charlotte's lawyer and second husband\n|5\u20136\n|5.06\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]\n|Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|6\n|6.02\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Lynn Cohen]]\n|Magda\n|Miranda's housekeeper\n|3\u20136\n|3.03\u20136.20\n|13\n|-\n|[[James Remar]]\n|Richard Wright\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|4\u20135, 6\n|4.10\u20135.03, 6.13\n|12\n|-\n|[[Mario Cantone]]\n|Anthony Marantino\n|Charlotte's wedding planner and friend\n|3\u20136\n|3.11\u20136.20\n|12\n|-\n|[[Frances Sternhagen]]\n|Bunny MacDougal\n|Trey's mother\n|3\u20135\n|3.09\u20135.06\n|10\n|-\n|[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]\n|Aleksandr Petrovsky\n|Carrie's boyfriend, 'The Russian'\n|6\n|6.12\u20136.20\n|9\n|-\n|[[Ron Livingston]]\n|Jack Berger\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.05\u20136.06\n|8\n|-\n|[[Sean Palmer]]\n|Marcus Adant\n|Stanford's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.04\u20136.18\n|8\n|-\n|[[Bridget Moynahan]]\n|Natasha Naginsky\n|Mr. Big's second wife\n|2\u20133\n|2.17\u20133.17\n|7\n|-\n|[[Ben Weber (actor)|Ben Weber]]\n|Skipper Johnston\n|Miranda's boyfriend\n|1\u20132\n|1.01\u20132.14\n|7\n|-\n|[[Blair Underwood]]\n|Dr. Robert E.

At a birthday party for Miranda, Carrie and her friends decide to start having sex \"like men\", meaning without emotional attachment. However, she realizes she cannot after getting brushed off by a man she has sex with one time later.\n\nCarrie has many chance encounters with a handsome businessman whom Samantha refers to as \"Mr. Big\". They begin to date, but Carrie is dismayed to find out he is still seeing other people. Although he eventually agrees to exclusivity, he doesn't introduce Carrie to his mother and won't refer to her as \"the one\", so rather than going on a planned vacation with him, Carrie breaks it off.\n\nCarrie sets up Miranda with her friend Skipper. Miranda and he date on and off; he is more laid back while Miranda is more forceful. After they break up, Miranda sees him with another woman and feels compelled to resume their relationship, but they again break up when he wants exclusivity and she does not.\n\nCharlotte dates a marriage-minded man but they clash over china patterns. She declines to have anal sex with another boyfriend and also consents to pose nude for a famous painter.\n\nSamantha sleeps with an artist who likes to videotape his encounters, with Charlotte's doorman, with a married couple, and with others. When she meets James, who seems utterly perfect for her, she's heartbroken to discover that he has an extremely small penis.\n\n===Season 2 (1999)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 2)}}\nCarrie dates a baseball player while on the rebound but breaks it off when she realizes she's not over Big. She then dates a sell-out filmmaker, a shoplifter, and a nice guy she scares away by snooping, and then takes up with Big again. She at first keeps this from her friends. Her and Big's relationship is rocky, and when he announces that he might have to move to Paris for a year but doesn't overtly invite Carrie to come with him, they break up a second time. Carrie then tries without success to convert a friend-with-benefits to something more, dates a writer with a great family but who is always \"early\" in bed, and then a recovering alcoholic who uses Carrie to replace his old addiction. She then runs into Big, returned from Paris, and his new 20-something fianc\u00e9e, Natasha (played by [[Bridget Moynahan]]).\n\nMiranda dates a dirty talker, fakes it with an ophthalmologist, and tries to adjust to a guy who likes to watch porn during sex. By the time she meets Steve, the bartender, she's unwilling to believe he is as nice as he seems. They start dating but the differences in their schedules and their finances lead to a breakup. She winds up back in bed with Steve, but not before dating a guy who wants to get caught, a Peeping Tom in the next building, and a divorced dad.\n\nCharlotte encounters a legendary purveyor of cunnilingus, a handy actor next door, a widower on the make, a man who undergoes adult circumcision, a famous actor, a too-effeminate pastry chef, a shoe salesman with a foot fetish, and a 20-something guy who gives her crabs.\n\nDespite a brief attempt at couples therapy, Samantha breaks up with James. She then sleeps with a litigator, a salsa dancer, her personal trainer, a sports fan who can only rally when his team does well, and Charlotte's brother. She then meets a man whose penis is too big even for her.\n\nThe end of Season two also marks the end of characters' [[Fourth wall|talking directly to the camera]].\n\n===Season 3 (2000)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 3)}}\nCarrie starts off dating a politician, followed by a [[bisexual]] person. Big marries Natasha, and Carrie meets Aidan, a furniture maker. They have a virtually flaw-free relationship until Carrie and Big begin an affair. When Natasha catches Carrie in Natasha and Big's apartment, Carrie and Big's affair ends as do eventually both Big's marriage and Carrie's relationship with Aidan.\n\nMiranda and Steve move in together. He tells Miranda he'd like them to have a baby, but a puppy purchase instead alerts Miranda to the fact that they're very different when it comes to maturity. Steve moves out and Miranda makes partner at her law firm. She also goes on to date a phone sex guy, a fake ER doctor, a guy who doesn't swallow his food, and a police detective.\n\nCharlotte, looking for a husband, dates an investment banker with an anger management problem, a photographer who gets her into menswear, a bad kisser, and a climax name caller. She then meets Trey MacDougal; despite an awkward \"proposal\", the discovery of his low libido and inability to perform sexually the night before their marriage, and conflict with his domineering mother, the two marry. They begin their marriage with a sexless honeymoon, and as sex remains an ongoing problem in their relationship, the two eventually separate.\n\nSamantha sleeps with a firefighter, a short man, her assistant, a black guy with a disapproving sister, a recreational [[Viagra]] user, a guy who tastes bad, Trey's Scottish cousin, a [[dildo]] model, and a college-aged virgin. She also has a [[menopause]] scare, gets tested for HIV, and buys a new apartment in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], where she has to make peace with the [[transgender women]] on her street.\n\nAfter Carrie's break-ups with Big and Aidan, she dates a guy who still lives at home, teaches a class at the [[Learning Annex]] on how to meet men, gets mugged, and tries to apologize to Natasha. She and Big also make an attempt at being friends.\n\n===Season 4 (2001\u201302)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 4)}}\nAfter a chance meeting with Aidan at the opening of a bar he co-owns, Carrie convinces him to restart their relationship. He moves into her apartment after purchasing it when her building goes [[co-op]] and then proposes. Despite her misgivings, Carrie accepts the proposal and then eventually realizes she's not ready for marriage. Despite discussing her concerns and initially agreeing to give her more time, Aidan soon pressures Carrie for marriage. She realizes this is because he does not trust her, given her past affair with Big. They break up and he moves out, and Carrie purchases her apartment after Charlotte lends her the down payment in the form of the engagement ring she received from Trey. At the end of Season Four, Carrie discovers that Big has sold his apartment and is moving to [[Napa, California]].\n\nCharlotte and Trey are living apart but continuing to have marital relations; they eventually reconcile and Charlotte moves back into their shared apartment. They decide to try for a baby but realize Charlotte is reproductively challenged; after [[fertility]] treatments and discussing adoption, their marriage breaks apart under the strain and they decide to divorce.\n\nMiranda supports Steve through [[testicular cancer]] and surgery. Later, when he feels emasculated by the surgery, they have sex and Miranda gets pregnant. She initially considers an abortion, which is particularly distressing to Charlotte, as she deals with her struggles to get pregnant, but Miranda decides to keep the baby.\n\nSamantha flirts with a priest, has nude photos taken of herself, tries to have a relationship with a lesbian, and sleeps with a baby talker, a wrestling coach, and a farmer. She then lands a big PR account with resolutely single hotel magnate Richard Wright. They begin a relationship that starts out as purely sexual but becomes something more to both of them, and they attempt [[monogamy]]. However, she eventually catches him cheating, and they break up.\n\n===Season 5 (2002)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 5)}}\nCarrie spends time by herself in Season Five; she fears this means she will be fired from writing her sex column, but instead a publisher wants to turn the columns into a book. A book tour lands her in San Francisco, where she reunites briefly with Big. In New York, she meets Jack Berger, a fellow author with whom she feels sparks, but who is attached.\n\nSamantha tries again with Richard but finds herself constantly paranoid. On a trip to Atlantic City with Richard and the girls, she cannot overcome her lack of trust in him and breaks it off for good.\n\nMiranda is now mother to son Brady and finds it difficult to work, date, and carry on her previous lifestyle. Steve is supportive, and she falls into bed with him one afternoon, making her question her feelings for him.\n\nCharlotte has a run-in with her former mother-in-law over the legalities of the apartment she shared with Trey, and she hires Harry Goldenblatt as her divorce attorney. Despite his physical shortcomings she finds herself attracted to him, and they begin a sexual relationship. She soon finds that she is developing real feelings for him. Harry, however, reveals that he must marry within his Jewish faith, causing Charlotte to actually consider conversion.\n\n===Season 6 (2003\u201304)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 6)}}\nCarrie begins dating Jack Berger, who is termed her best 'mental match' of all her relationships. However, his struggles as an author and her success with her upcoming book cause too much conflict between them, and they break up. Big returns to New York for [[angioplasty]], and Carrie realizes she still has feelings for him; she also realizes he still cannot fully commit. After he returns to Napa, she meets Aleksandr, a famous Russian artist. Aleksandr seems to be attentive to her in a way that Big never was, and he asks her to come to Paris with him. She does, briefly, but realizes how inattentive he is when working, and she breaks it off with him just as Big arrives in Paris, looking for her, ready to finally commit to her being \"the one\".\n\nCharlotte decides that life with Harry, who accepts her fertility issues, would be worth converting to Judaism. After this process, she presses Harry to \"set the date\" in an insulting way and he breaks it off with her. However, they run into each other at a mixer and, after her tearful apology, rekindle their relationship and eventually marry. After fertility treatments fail, they decide to adopt, and eventually learn they have been approved to adopt a child from China.\n\nOnce Miranda realizes she's still in love with Steve, he begins a serious relationship with someone else (Debbie), and so she does the same with Robert (played by Blair Underwood). However, at their son Brady's first birthday party, they reveal their feelings for each other and renew their relationship. Miranda proposes to Steve and they marry in a community park. Needing more room for their growing family, she consents to moving to [[Brooklyn]], where they buy a brownstone. After Steve's mother Mary (played by [[Anne Meara]]) is revealed to have suffered a stroke and subsequent memory loss, she moves in with the couple.\n\nSamantha begins a relationship with a much younger waiter, Jerry Jerrod, who turns out to be a struggling actor. She uses her PR skills to help his career, even changing his name to Smith Jerrod. Despite trying to keep their relationship as casual as her others, she develops true feelings for him. Smith supports her after she is diagnosed with breast cancer, shaving his own head in sympathy after catching her shaving her head when [[chemotherapy]] makes her hair fall out. He also insists on waiting for her when her treatment diminishes her sex drive. When he flies home from his movie shoot just to tell her that he loves her, she replies, \"You have meant more to me than any man I've ever known.\"\n\nThe season and the series concludes with the four girlfriends reunited in New York City, and with Carrie receiving a phone call from Big (which finally reveals his first name, John), telling her that his Napa house is up for sale and he is headed back to New York. Carrie's final voiceover states: \"The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the you ''you'' love, well, that's just fabulous.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''Sex and the City'' premiered on [[HBO]], June 6, 1998, and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms of the season.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=ed. by Kim Akass & Janet|title=Reading Sex and the City|date=2004|publisher=I.B.

The first clue is in the opening credits of the television show. Carrie is standing in a New York street in a ballet skirt, the sort that toddlers wear. She is dressed, unmistakably, as a child. And, because she is sex columnist on a newspaper, a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past. 'Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex,' says the bus. And there, before any dialogue hits your ears, you have the two woeful female archetypes that ''Sex and the City'' loves\u2014woman as sex object and woman as child ...

The show uses voiceovers to reveal Carrie's inner thought life, which is often in conflict with how she is expressing herself externally. As pop culture expert Ashli L. Dykes points out, \"... [the] fear that men will no longer find a woman attractive if she reveals her true self is in contrast to the relationships among the four main female characters...\"<ref>Dykes, Ashli L. \"'And I Started Wondering....\": Voiceover and Conversation in 'Sex and the City.'\" Studies in Popular Culture, vol. 34, no. 1, 2011, pp. 49\u201366.

Some argue whatever label is applied to the show, it offered an important contribution \"to ongoing dialogue\"<ref>Hermes, Joke (2002). \"Television and Its Viewers in Post-Feminist Dialogue Internet-mediated Response to 'Ally McBeal' and 'Sex and the City'\".

Or How Popular Culture Functions as a Channel for Feminist Discourse\". The Journal of Popular Culture, p. 18.</ref>\n\nAndrea Press criticised the show for how it handled topics such as unexpected pregnancy, stating that it contrasts with feminist progressive thought. In one episode, Miranda is faced with an unexpected pregnancy, which causes Carrie to reflect on her own experience of pregnancy and abortion. Press argued that Carrie's shame when sharing this story with her boyfriend serves to \"undermine\" the hard-fought freedoms that allowed her choice with \"multiple critical perspectives toward the act\"<ref name=\"jstor.org\">Press, Andrea. \"Gender and Family in Televisions Golden Age and Beyond.\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 625, 2009, pp. 139\u2013150.

In 2013, [[Glamour (magazine)|''Glamour'' magazine]] called Carrie \"the worst\" character on the show, saying that \"her brattiness and self-absorption eclipsed her redeeming qualities and even her awesome shoes.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Angelo | first= Megan | title = Confession: I've Never Been Able to Stand Carrie Bradshaw | newspaper = Glamour | date = January 14, 2013 | url= http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/01/carrie-bradshaw.html | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref> In a 2010 retrospective about the previous two decades in pop culture, [[ABC News]] named Carrie one of the ten worst characters of the past twenty years, calling her a \"snippy, self-righteous Manhattan snob\" and citing the character's actions in ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' as evidence that she was beyond personal growth or redemption.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Marikar, Sheila | first= Heron, Liz | title = Top 10 Worst TV and Film Characters in the Last 20 | newspaper = ABC News | date = June 4, 2010 | url= http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/01/carrie-bradshaw.html | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref> Emily Nussbaum of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', looking back on the show a decade after it went off the air, argued Bradshaw was \"the unacknowledged first female anti-hero on television,\" who began as a \"happy, curious explorer, out companionably smoking with modellizers [''sic''],\" but from the second season on she \"spun out, becoming anxious, obsessive, and, despite her charm, wildly self-centered.\" Nussbaum also asserted that it is only over time that the show's reputation has \"shrunk and faded,\" largely due to disappointment that the show \"gave in\" to the limits of romantic comedy toward the end of the series. Until then, Nussbaum writes, ''Sex and the City'' \"was sharp, iconoclastic television.\" In answer to the question of why the show is now \"so often portrayed as a set of empty, static cartoons, an embarrassment to womankind,\" Nussbaum wrote: \"It's a classic misunderstanding, I think, stemming from an unexamined hierarchy: the assumption that anything stylized (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.\" Nussbaum also pushed against criticism of ''Sex and the City'' as anti-feminist, arguing for a more complex view of the characters as situated within different waves of feminism: \"Miranda and Carrie were [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]], who believed in egalitarianism; Charlotte and Samantha were [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave feminists]], focused on exploiting the power of femininity, from opposing angles.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Nussbaum | first= Emily | title= How \"Sex and the City\" Lost its Good Name| newspaper = The New Yorker| date= July 29, 2013| url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2013/07/29/130729crte_television_nussbaum?currentPage=all | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA 2018 article in [[The Guardian]] entitled \"'That show was as white as it gets!': Sex and the City's problematic legacy\", pointed to the lack of any non-white series regulars and \"racial insensitivities\" in the show like Carrie's \"ghetto gold\" reference or Samantha's wearing an [[afro]] wig to cover her baldness from [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=\"Ellen E.

Mexico and Oceania's edition come packaged in a beauty case.\n\nAs well as missing out on some special features, many in Europe had trouble with the region 2 edition of the season 1 DVD. The season was not converted into a [[PAL]] video signal; it instead remained in its original American [[NTSC]] format, which caused compatibility problems with some European television sets and DVD players. All subsequent [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD releases of the program were appropriately transferred to [[PAL]] video using the original film prints, and season 1 has since been re-released in PAL format.\n\nOutside the US, ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets were released through [[Paramount Pictures]]. American and Canadian DVDs were released through the program's original broadcasters, [[HBO]]. In Australia, single editions have been released, wherein each disc is sold separately. In [[South Korea]], complete, six-season, special DVD shoebox sets were released. In Brazil, the first and fifth seasons were released on DVD Dual, but all other seasons were released in DVD [[box sets]].\n\nSelected episodes are also available as part of the ''Sex and the City Essentials'' DVD collection. These are four separately-packaged discs containing three selected episodes that fit a common theme.\n* ''The Best of Lust'': Contains the episodes \"The Fuck Buddy\", \"Running with Scissors\", and \"The Turtle and the Hare\".\n* ''The Best of Mr. Big'': Contains the episodes \"Sex and the City\", \"Ex and the City\", and \"I Heart NY\".\n* ''The Best of Romance'': Contains the episodes \"Baby, Talk is Cheap\", \"Hop, Skip and a Week\", and \"An American Girl in Paris (Part Deux)\".\n* ''The Best of Breakups'': Contains the episodes \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", \"I Love a Charade\", and \"The Post-it Always Sticks Twice\".\n* ''The Best of Fashion'': Contains the episodes \"Secret Sex\", \"The Real Me\", and \"Luck Be an Old Lady\". This DVD was only released to Target stores in the US and was the only DVD of the \"Essentials\" collection to have a colored cover instead of a black and white one like the other four.\n\n==Soundtrack releases==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nTwo digital CDs (the albums from [[Irma Records]]) contain tracks used in the show's actual soundtrack.\n* '''''[[Sex and the City: Music from the HBO Series|Sex and the City \u2013 Soundtrack]]''''' [Import]\n:2000/2001/2002\n:[[Sire Records]]\n:Includes the main theme from the show, written by [[Douglas J.

Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as [[IBM PC&nbsp;DOS]], and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as \"DOS\" (which is also the generic acronym for [[disk operating system]]). MS-DOS was the main operating system for [[IBM PC compatible]] personal computers during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), in various generations of the graphical [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.\n\nIBM licensed and re-released it in 1981, as [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax, and capabilities.\n\nDuring its lifetime, [[Comparison of DOS operating systems|several competing products]] were released for the x86 platform,<ref name=\"roy\">{{cite book |title=A history of the personal computer: the people and the technology |author-first=Roy A. |author-last=Allan |chapter=Microsoft in the 1980s, part III 1980s&nbsp;\u2013 The IBM/Macintosh era |page=14 |isbn=0-9689108-0-7 |date=2001 |publisher=Allan Pub. |location=[[London, Ontario]] |url=http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/ |access-date=December 5, 2009}} [http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/eBook12.pdf]</ref> and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000.<ref name=\"Historical Essays\">{{cite web |title=A Compilation of 8 Historical Essays |publisher=Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyto0YS-bpYC&pg=PT18 |access-date=January 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014035229/https://books.google.com/books?id=oyto0YS-bpYC&pg=PT18 |archive-date=October 14, 2016}}</ref> Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at [[Intel 8086]] processors running on computer hardware using [[floppy disk]]s to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft's development from a [[programming language]] company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible installation space.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|DOS|Timeline of DOS operating systems}}\nMS-DOS was a renamed form of [[86-DOS]]<ref name=\"PATERSON\">{{cite web |title=Father of DOS Still Having Fun at Microsoft |author-last=Conner |author-first=Doug |website=patersontech.com |publisher=Micronews |url=http://www.patersontech.com/Dos/Micronews/paterson04_10_98.htm |access-date=December 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209023553/http://www.patersontech.com/Dos/Micronews/paterson04_10_98.htm |archive-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>{{snd}} owned by [[Seattle Computer Products]], written by [[Tim Paterson]].

Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, similar to the situation that existed for [[CP/M]], and with MS-DOS emulating the [[CP/M BIOS|same solution]] as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. To this end, MS-DOS was designed with a modular structure with internal device drivers (the [[DOS BIOS]]), minimally for primary disk drives and the console, integrated with the kernel and loaded by the boot loader, and installable device drivers for other devices loaded and integrated at boot time. The [[OEM]] would use a development kit provided by Microsoft to build a version of MS-DOS with their basic I/O drivers and a standard Microsoft kernel, which they would typically supply on disk to end users along with the hardware. Thus, there were many different versions of \"MS-DOS\" for different hardware, and there is a major distinction between an IBM-compatible (or ISA) machine and an MS-DOS [compatible] machine. Some machines, like the [[Tandy 2000]], were MS-DOS compatible but not IBM-compatible, so they could run software written exclusively for MS-DOS without dependence on the peripheral hardware of the IBM PC architecture.\n\nThis design would have worked well for compatibility, if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O, and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]]). However, in MS-DOS's early days, the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially for games, which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware.

Applications requesting the version through the API would report version 8.00.\n\nMicrosoft DOS was released through the OEM channel, until Digital Research released DR&nbsp;DOS 5.0 as a retail upgrade. With PC&nbsp;DOS 5.00.1, the IBM-Microsoft agreement started to end, and IBM entered the retail DOS market with IBM DOS 5.00.1, 5.02, 6.00 and PC&nbsp;DOS 6.1, 6.3, 7, 2000 and 7.1.\n\nLocalized versions of MS-DOS existed for different markets.<ref name=\"country\">{{Cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722862.aspx#XSLTsection136121120120 |title=Country |website=MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |at=ANSI.SYS |access-date=April 1, 2014 |via=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]}}</ref> While Western issues of MS-DOS evolved around the same set of tools and drivers just with localized message languages and differing sets of supported codepages and keyboard layouts, some language versions were considerably different from Western issues and were adapted to run on localized PC hardware with additional BIOS services not available in Western PCs, support multiple hardware codepages for displays and printers, support DBCS, alternative input methods and graphics output. Affected issues include Japanese ([[DOS/V]]), Korean, Arabic (ADOS 3.3/5.0), Hebrew (HDOS 3.3/5.0), Russian ([[Russian MS-DOS 4.01|RDOS 4.01]]/[[Russian MS-DOS 5.0|5.0]]) as well as some other Eastern European versions of DOS.\n\n==Competition==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n[[Image:Msdosad.jpg|left|thumb|270px|The original MS-DOS advertisement in 1981.]]\n\nOn microcomputers based on the [[Intel 8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors, including the IBM PC and clones, the initial competition to the PC DOS/MS-DOS line came from [[Digital Research]], whose [[CP/M]] operating system had inspired MS-DOS. In fact, there remains controversy as to whether QDOS was more or less plagiarized from early versions of CP/M code. Digital Research released [[CP/M-86]] a few months after MS-DOS, and it was offered as an alternative to MS-DOS and Microsoft's licensing requirements, but at a higher price. [[Executable program]]s for CP/M-86 and MS-DOS were not interchangeable with each other; many [[applications software|applications]] were sold in both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions until MS-DOS became preponderant (later Digital Research operating systems could run both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software). MS-DOS originally supported the simple [[COM file|.COM]], which was modeled after a similar but binary incompatible format known from [[CP/M-80]]. CP/M-86 instead supported a [[Relocation (computing)|relocatable]] format using the [[file extension]] [[CMD file (CP/M)|.CMD]] to avoid name conflicts with CP/M-80 and MS-DOS .COM files. MS-DOS version 1.0 added a more advanced relocatable .[[EXE]] executable file format.\n\nMost of the machines in the early days of MS-DOS had differing system architectures and there was a certain degree of incompatibility, and subsequently [[vendor lock-in]]. Users who began using MS-DOS with their machines were compelled to continue using the version customized for their hardware, or face trying to get all of their proprietary hardware and software to work with the new system.\n\nIn the business world the 808x-based machines that MS-DOS was tied to faced competition from the [[Unix]] operating system which ran on many different hardware architectures. Microsoft itself sold a version of Unix for the PC called [[Xenix]].\n\nIn the emerging world of home users, a variety of other computers based on various other processors were in serious competition with the IBM PC: the [[Apple II]], early [[Apple Macintosh]], the [[Commodore 64]] and others did not use the 808x processor; many 808x machines of different architectures used custom versions of MS-DOS. At first all these machines were in competition. In time the IBM PC hardware configuration became dominant in the 808x market as software written to communicate directly with the PC hardware without using standard operating system calls ran much faster, but on true PC-compatibles only. Non-PC-compatible 808x machines were too small a market to have fast software written for them alone, and the market remained open only for IBM PCs and machines that closely imitated their architecture, all running either a single version of MS-DOS compatible only with PCs, or the equivalent IBM PC DOS. Most clones cost much less than IBM-branded machines of similar performance, and became widely used by home users, while IBM PCs had a large share of the business computer market.\n\nMicrosoft and IBM together began what was intended as the follow-on to MS-DOS/PC DOS, called [[OS/2]]. When OS/2 was released in 1987, Microsoft began an advertising campaign announcing that \"DOS is Dead\" and stating that version 4 was the last full release. OS/2 was designed for efficient multi-tasking (as was standard in operating systems since 1963) and offered a number of advanced features that had been designed together with similar [[look and feel]]; it was seen as the legitimate heir to the \"kludgy\" DOS platform.\n\nMS-DOS had grown in spurts, with many significant features being taken or duplicated from Microsoft's other products and operating systems. MS-DOS also grew by incorporating, by direct licensing or feature duplicating, the functionality of tools and utilities developed by independent companies, such as [[Norton Utilities]], [[PC Tools (Central Point Software)|PC Tools]] ([[Microsoft Anti-Virus]]), [[QEMM]] expanded memory manager, [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Stac|Stacker]] [[disk compression]], and others.\n\nDuring the period when Digital Research was competing in the operating system market some computers, like [[Amstrad PC1512]], were sold with floppy disks for two operating systems (only one of which could be used at a time), MS-DOS and CP/M-86 or a derivative of it. Digital Research produced [[DOS Plus]], which was compatible with MS-DOS 2.11, supported CP/M-86 programs, had additional features including multi-tasking, and could read and write disks in CP/M and MS-DOS format.\n\nWhile OS/2 was under protracted development, Digital Research released the MS-DOS compatible [[DR DOS]] 5.0, which included features only available as third-party add-ons for MS-DOS. Unwilling to lose any portion of the market, Microsoft responded by announcing the \"pending\" release of MS-DOS 5.0 in May 1990. This effectively killed most DR DOS sales until the actual release of MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991. Digital Research brought out DR DOS 6.0, which sold well until the \"pre-announcement\" of MS-DOS 6.0 again stifled the sales of DR DOS.\n\nMicrosoft had been accused of carefully orchestrating leaks about future versions of MS-DOS in an attempt to create what in the industry is called FUD ([[fear, uncertainty, and doubt]]) regarding DR DOS. For example, in October 1990, shortly after the release of DR DOS 5.0, and long before the eventual June 1991 release of MS-DOS 5.0, stories on feature enhancements in MS-DOS started to appear in ''InfoWorld'' and ''PC Week''. [[Brad Silverberg]], then Vice President of Systems Software at Microsoft and general manager of its Windows and MS-DOS Business Unit, wrote a forceful letter to ''PC Week'' (November 5, 1990), denying that Microsoft was engaged in FUD tactics (\"to serve our customers better, we decided to be more forthcoming about version 5.0\") and denying that Microsoft copied features from DR DOS:\n\n<blockquote>\"The feature enhancements of MS-DOS version 5.0 were decided and development was begun long before we heard about DR DOS 5.0. There will be some similar features. With 50 million MS-DOS users, it shouldn't be surprising that DRI has heard some of the same requests from customers that we have.\"&nbsp;\u2013 (Schulman et al. 1994).<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\">{{cite book |author-first1=Andrew |author-last1=Schulman |author-first2=Ralf D. |author-last2=Brown |author-link2=Ralf D.

Much of Microsoft's further contributions to OS/2 also went into creating a third [[GUI]] replacement for DOS, [[Windows NT]].\n\nIBM, which had already been developing the next version of OS/2, carried on development of the platform without Microsoft and sold it as the alternative to DOS and Windows.\n\n==Legal issues==\nAs a response to [[Digital Research]]'s [[DR DOS 6.0]], which bundled SuperStor disk compression, Microsoft opened negotiations with [[Stac Electronics]], vendor of the most popular DOS disk compression tool, Stacker. In the [[due diligence]] process, Stac engineers had shown Microsoft part of the Stacker source code. Stac was unwilling to meet Microsoft's terms for licensing Stacker and withdrew from the negotiations. Microsoft chose to license Vertisoft's DoubleDisk, using it as the core for its DoubleSpace disk compression.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec6/art1.htm |title=How Safe is Disk Compression? |date=February 1994 |work=[[BYTE Magazine]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619060529/http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec6/art1.htm |archive-date=June 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMS-DOS 6.0 and 6.20 were released in 1993, both including the Microsoft DoubleSpace disk compression utility program. Stac successfully sued Microsoft for patent infringement regarding the compression algorithm used in DoubleSpace. This resulted in the 1994 release of MS-DOS 6.21, which had disk compression removed. Shortly afterwards came version 6.22, with a new version of the disk compression system, DriveSpace, which had a different compression algorithm to avoid the infringing code.\n\nPrior to 1995, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS (and Windows) to computer manufacturers under three types of agreement: per-processor (a fee for each system the company sold), per-system (a fee for each system of a particular model), or per-copy (a fee for each copy of MS-DOS installed). The largest manufacturers used the per-processor arrangement, which had the lowest fee. This arrangement made it expensive for the large manufacturers to migrate to any other operating system, such as DR DOS. In 1991, the U.S. government [[Federal Trade Commission]] began investigating Microsoft's licensing procedures, resulting in a 1994 settlement agreement limiting Microsoft to per-copy licensing. Digital Research did not gain by this settlement, and years later its successor in interest, [[Caldera, Inc.|Caldera]], sued Microsoft for damages in the ''[[Caldera v. Microsoft]]'' lawsuit. It was believed that the settlement ran in the order of $150&nbsp;million, but was revealed in November 2009 with the release of the Settlement Agreement to be $280&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Groklaw_2009_NovellWP\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091120165256836 |title=Exhibits to Microsoft's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment in Novell WordPerfect Case |date=November 23, 2009 |website=[[Groklaw]] |access-date=October 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Use of undocumented APIs==\nMicrosoft also used a variety of tactics in MS-DOS and several of their applications and development tools that, while operating perfectly when running on genuine MS-DOS (and PC DOS), would break when run on another vendor's implementation of DOS. Notable examples of this practice included:\n* [[Microsoft Pascal|Microsoft's QuickPascal]] released in early 1989 was the first MS product that checked for MS-DOS by modifying the program's [[Program Segment Prefix]] using undocumented DOS functions, and then checked whether or not the associated value changed in a fixed position within the DOS data segment (also undocumented). This check also made it into later MS products, including Microsoft [[QuickC]] v2.5, Programmer's Workbench and Microsoft C v6.0.<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\"/>\n* The [[AARD code]], a block of code in the windows launcher (WIN.COM) and a few other system files of Windows 3.1. It was XOR encrypted, [[Self-modifying code|self-modifying]], and deliberately obfuscated, using various undocumented DOS structures and functions to determine whether or not Windows really was running on MS-DOS.<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\"/> In the beta versions, it displayed an \"error\" message if the test for genuine MS-DOS failed, prompting the user to abort or continue, with abort the default. In the final release version, the code still ran, but the message and prompt were disabled by an added flag byte, rendering it (probably) ineffectual.\n** Note that the Windows 3.0 beta code only gave a warning that Windows would not operate properly on a \"foreign\" OS. It did, in fact, run just fine on DR DOS 6.0.\n* Interrupt routines called by Windows to inform MS-DOS that Windows is starting/exiting, information that MS-DOS retained in an IN_WINDOWS flag, in spite of the fact that MS-DOS and Windows were supposed to be two separate products.<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\"/>\n\n==End of MS-DOS==\n[[File:US Navy 110129-N-7676W-152 Culinary Specialist 3rd Class John Smith uses the existing DOS-based food service management system aboard the aircraft.jpg|thumb|{{As of|2011}}, MS-DOS is still used in some enterprises to run legacy applications, such as this [[United States Navy|US Navy]] food service management system.]]\nThe introduction of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990, with an easy-to-use [[graphical user interface]], marked the beginning of the end for the command-line driven MS-DOS. With the release of [[Windows 95]] (and continuing in the [[Windows 9x]] product line through to [[Windows Me]]), an integrated version of MS-DOS was used for [[bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]], troubleshooting, and backwards-compatibility with old DOS software, particularly games, and no longer released as a standalone product.<ref name=\"Goldstein 2017\">{{cite news |author-last=Goldstein |author-first=Phil |title=MS-DOS Became Synonymous with PC Operating Systems in the 1980s |url=https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2017/10/ms-dos-became-synonymous-pc-operating-systems-1980s |access-date=January 26, 2018 |publisher=BizTech Magazine |date=October 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126161504/https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2017/10/ms-dos-became-synonymous-pc-operating-systems-1980s |archive-date=January 26, 2018}}</ref> In Windows 95, the DOS, called MS-DOS 7, can be booted separately, without the Windows GUI; this capability was retained through Windows 98 Second Edition. Windows Me removed the capability to boot its underlying MS-DOS 8.0 alone from a hard disk, but retained the ability to make a DOS boot floppy disk (called an \"Emergency Boot Disk\") and can be hacked to restore full access to the underlying DOS.\n\nIn contrast to the Windows 9x series, the [[Windows NT]]-derived 32-bit operating systems developed alongside the 9x series ([[Windows NT]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]] and newer) do not contain MS-DOS as part of the operating system, as NT is not built as a subsystem running on DOS but an entirely different independent operating system,<ref name=\"Goldstein 2017\"/> but provide a subset of DOS emulation to run DOS applications and provide DOS-like command prompt windows.

Starting with Windows 10, the ability to create a DOS startup disk has been removed and so either a [[virtual machine]] running MS-DOS or an older version (in a virtual machine or dual boot) must be used to format a floppy disk, or an image must be obtained from an external source. Other solutions include using DOS compatible alternatives, such as [[FreeDOS]] or even copying the required files and boot sector themselves.\n\nMS-DOS 6.22 was the last standalone version produced by Microsoft for [[Intel 8088]], [[Intel 8086]], and [[Intel 80286]] processors, which remain available for download via their [[MSDN]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Supplemental Disk&nbsp;\u2014 MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx |publisher=Microsoft Developer Network |access-date=January 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902225102/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx |archive-date=September 2, 2017}}</ref> volume license, and OEM license partner websites, for customers with valid login credentials. MS-DOS is still used in embedded x86 systems due to its simple architecture and minimal memory and processor requirements, though some current products have switched to the still-maintained open-source alternative [[FreeDOS#Commercial uses|FreeDOS]].\n\nIn 2018, Microsoft released the [https://github.com/Microsoft/MS-DOS source code for MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0] on [[GitHub]]. The purpose of this, according to Microsoft, is mainly for education and experimentation with historic operating systems and for new programmers to gain an understanding of how low-level software works, both historic and current.\n\nDue to the historical nature of the software, Microsoft will not accept any [[pull request]]s to the code; only pull requests for modified and translated documentation will be accepted. Users, however, are allowed and fully encouraged to [[Fork (software development)|fork]] the repository containing the MS-DOS source code and make their own modifications, and do whatever they like with it.\n\n==Windows command-line interface==\nAll versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] have had an MS-DOS-like [[command-line interface]] (CLI) called [[Command Prompt]]. This could run many DOS and variously Win32, OS/2 1.x and [[POSIX]] command line utilities in the same command-line session, allowing piping between commands. The user interface, and the icon up to Windows 2000, followed the native MS-DOS interface.\n\nThe [[16-bit]] versions of Windows (up to 3.11) ran as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on top of MS-DOS. With [[Windows 95]], 98, 98 SE and Me, the MS-DOS part was (superficially) integrated, treating the MS-DOS operating system and the Windows GUI as a complete package, though the DOS component could actually stand alone. The command line accessed the DOS command line (usually <code>COMMAND.COM</code>) through a Windows module (WINOLDAP.MOD).{{clarify|date=August 2015}}\n\nA new line of Windows, (Windows NT), boot through a kernel whose sole purpose is to load Windows. One cannot run Win32 applications in the loader system in the manner that OS/2, UNIX or Consumer Windows can launch character-mode sessions.\n\nThe command session permits running of various supported command line utilities from Win32, MS-DOS, OS/2 1.x and POSIX. The emulators for MS-DOS, OS/2 and POSIX use the host's window in the same way that Win16 applications use the Win32 explorer. Using the host's window allows one to pipe output between emulations.\n\nThe MS-DOS emulation is done through the [[NTVDM]] (NT Virtual DOS Machine). This is a modified [[SoftPC]] (a former product similar to [[VirtualPC]]), running a modified MS-DOS 5 (NTIO.SYS and NTDOS.SYS). The output is handled by the console DLLs, so that the program at the prompt (<code>CMD.EXE</code>, <code>4NT.EXE</code>, <code>TCC.EXE</code>), can see the output. 64-bit Windows does not have either the DOS emulation, or the DOS commands EDIT, [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]], [[EDLIN]]), that come with 32-bit Windows.\n\nThe DOS version returns 5.00 or 5.50, depending on which API function is used to determine it. Utilities from MS-DOS 5.00 run in this emulation without modification. The very early beta programs of NT show MS-DOS 30.00, but programs running in MS-DOS 30.00 would assume that OS/2 was in control.\n\nThe OS/2 emulation is handled through OS2SS.EXE and OS2.EXE, and DOSCALLS.DLL. OS2.EXE is a version of the OS/2 shell (CMD.EXE), which passes commands down to the OS2SS.EXE, and input-output to the Windows NT shell. Windows 2000 was the last version of NT to support OS/2. The emulation is OS/2 1.30.\n\nPOSIX is emulated through the POSIX shell, but no emulated shell; the commands are handled directly in CMD.EXE.\n\nThe Command Prompt is often called the MS-DOS prompt. In part, this was the official name for it in Windows 9x and early versions of Windows NT (NT 3.5 and earlier), and in part because the SoftPC emulation of DOS redirects output into it. Actually only <code>COMMAND.COM</code> and other 16-bit commands run in an NTVDM with <code>AUTOEXEC.NT</code> and <code>CONFIG.NT</code> initialisation determined by <code>[[Program information file|_DEFAULT.PIF]]</code>, optionally permitting the use of [[Win32 console]] applications and internal commands with an <code>NTCMDPROMPT</code> directive.\n\n[[Win32 console]] applications use <code>CMD.EXE</code> as their command prompt shell. This confusion does not exist under OS/2 because there are separate DOS and OS/2 prompts, and running a DOS program under OS/2 will launch a separate DOS window to run the application.\n\nAll versions of Windows for [[Itanium]] (no longer sold by Microsoft) and [[x86-64]] architectures no longer include the NTVDM and can therefore no longer natively run DOS or 16-bit Windows applications. There are alternatives in the form of [[virtual machine]] emulators such as Microsoft's own [[Virtual PC]], as well as [[VMware]], [[DOSBox]], and others.\n\n==Legacy compatibility==\nFrom 1983 onwards, various companies worked on [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) capable of running on PC hardware. However, this required duplicated effort and did not provide much consistency in interface design (even between products from the same company).\n\nLater, in 1985, [[Microsoft Windows 1.0]] was released as Microsoft's first attempt at providing a consistent user interface (for applications). The early versions of Windows ran on top of MS-DOS. At first Windows met with little success, but this was also true for most other companies' efforts as well, for example [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]. After version 3.0, Windows gained market acceptance.\n\n[[Windows 9x]] used the DOS boot process to launch into protected mode. Basic features related to the file system, such as long file names, were only available to DOS when running as a subsystem of Windows. [[Windows NT]] runs independently of DOS but includes [[NTVDM]], a component for simulating a DOS environment for legacy applications.\n\n==Related systems==\n{{main|DOS}}\nMS-DOS compatible systems include:\n* [[IBM PC DOS]]\n* [[DR DOS]], [[Novell DOS]], [[OpenDOS]]\n* [[FreeDOS]]\n* [[PTS-DOS]]\n* [[ROM-DOS]]\n\nMicrosoft manufactured [[IBM PC DOS]] for IBM.

Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as [[IBM PC&nbsp;DOS]], and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as \"DOS\" (which is also the generic acronym for [[disk operating system]]). MS-DOS was the main operating system for [[IBM PC compatible]] personal computers during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), in various generations of the graphical [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.\n\nIBM licensed and re-released it in 1981, as [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax, and capabilities.\n\nDuring its lifetime, [[Comparison of DOS operating systems|several competing products]] were released for the x86 platform,<ref name=\"roy\">{{cite book |title=A history of the personal computer: the people and the technology |author-first=Roy A. |author-last=Allan |chapter=Microsoft in the 1980s, part III 1980s&nbsp;\u2013 The IBM/Macintosh era |page=14 |isbn=0-9689108-0-7 |date=2001 |publisher=Allan Pub. |location=[[London, Ontario]] |url=http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/ |access-date=December 5, 2009}} [http://www.retrocomputing.net/info/allan/eBook12.pdf]</ref> and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000.<ref name=\"Historical Essays\">{{cite web |title=A Compilation of 8 Historical Essays |publisher=Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyto0YS-bpYC&pg=PT18 |access-date=January 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014035229/https://books.google.com/books?id=oyto0YS-bpYC&pg=PT18 |archive-date=October 14, 2016}}</ref> Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at [[Intel 8086]] processors running on computer hardware using [[floppy disk]]s to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft's development from a [[programming language]] company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible installation space.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|DOS|Timeline of DOS operating systems}}\nMS-DOS was a renamed form of [[86-DOS]]<ref name=\"PATERSON\">{{cite web |title=Father of DOS Still Having Fun at Microsoft |author-last=Conner |author-first=Doug |website=patersontech.com |publisher=Micronews |url=http://www.patersontech.com/Dos/Micronews/paterson04_10_98.htm |access-date=December 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209023553/http://www.patersontech.com/Dos/Micronews/paterson04_10_98.htm |archive-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>{{snd}} owned by [[Seattle Computer Products]], written by [[Tim Paterson]].

Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, similar to the situation that existed for [[CP/M]], and with MS-DOS emulating the [[CP/M BIOS|same solution]] as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. To this end, MS-DOS was designed with a modular structure with internal device drivers (the [[DOS BIOS]]), minimally for primary disk drives and the console, integrated with the kernel and loaded by the boot loader, and installable device drivers for other devices loaded and integrated at boot time. The [[OEM]] would use a development kit provided by Microsoft to build a version of MS-DOS with their basic I/O drivers and a standard Microsoft kernel, which they would typically supply on disk to end users along with the hardware. Thus, there were many different versions of \"MS-DOS\" for different hardware, and there is a major distinction between an IBM-compatible (or ISA) machine and an MS-DOS [compatible] machine. Some machines, like the [[Tandy 2000]], were MS-DOS compatible but not IBM-compatible, so they could run software written exclusively for MS-DOS without dependence on the peripheral hardware of the IBM PC architecture.\n\nThis design would have worked well for compatibility, if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O, and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]]). However, in MS-DOS's early days, the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially for games, which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware.

Applications requesting the version through the API would report version 8.00.\n\nMicrosoft DOS was released through the OEM channel, until Digital Research released DR&nbsp;DOS 5.0 as a retail upgrade. With PC&nbsp;DOS 5.00.1, the IBM-Microsoft agreement started to end, and IBM entered the retail DOS market with IBM DOS 5.00.1, 5.02, 6.00 and PC&nbsp;DOS 6.1, 6.3, 7, 2000 and 7.1.\n\nLocalized versions of MS-DOS existed for different markets.<ref name=\"country\">{{Cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722862.aspx#XSLTsection136121120120 |title=Country |website=MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |at=ANSI.SYS |access-date=April 1, 2014 |via=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]}}</ref> While Western issues of MS-DOS evolved around the same set of tools and drivers just with localized message languages and differing sets of supported codepages and keyboard layouts, some language versions were considerably different from Western issues and were adapted to run on localized PC hardware with additional BIOS services not available in Western PCs, support multiple hardware codepages for displays and printers, support DBCS, alternative input methods and graphics output. Affected issues include Japanese ([[DOS/V]]), Korean, Arabic (ADOS 3.3/5.0), Hebrew (HDOS 3.3/5.0), Russian ([[Russian MS-DOS 4.01|RDOS 4.01]]/[[Russian MS-DOS 5.0|5.0]]) as well as some other Eastern European versions of DOS.\n\n==Competition==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n[[Image:Msdosad.jpg|left|thumb|270px|The original MS-DOS advertisement in 1981.]]\n\nOn microcomputers based on the [[Intel 8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors, including the IBM PC and clones, the initial competition to the PC DOS/MS-DOS line came from [[Digital Research]], whose [[CP/M]] operating system had inspired MS-DOS. In fact, there remains controversy as to whether QDOS was more or less plagiarized from early versions of CP/M code. Digital Research released [[CP/M-86]] a few months after MS-DOS, and it was offered as an alternative to MS-DOS and Microsoft's licensing requirements, but at a higher price. [[Executable program]]s for CP/M-86 and MS-DOS were not interchangeable with each other; many [[applications software|applications]] were sold in both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions until MS-DOS became preponderant (later Digital Research operating systems could run both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software). MS-DOS originally supported the simple [[COM file|.COM]], which was modeled after a similar but binary incompatible format known from [[CP/M-80]]. CP/M-86 instead supported a [[Relocation (computing)|relocatable]] format using the [[file extension]] [[CMD file (CP/M)|.CMD]] to avoid name conflicts with CP/M-80 and MS-DOS .COM files. MS-DOS version 1.0 added a more advanced relocatable .[[EXE]] executable file format.\n\nMost of the machines in the early days of MS-DOS had differing system architectures and there was a certain degree of incompatibility, and subsequently [[vendor lock-in]]. Users who began using MS-DOS with their machines were compelled to continue using the version customized for their hardware, or face trying to get all of their proprietary hardware and software to work with the new system.\n\nIn the business world the 808x-based machines that MS-DOS was tied to faced competition from the [[Unix]] operating system which ran on many different hardware architectures. Microsoft itself sold a version of Unix for the PC called [[Xenix]].\n\nIn the emerging world of home users, a variety of other computers based on various other processors were in serious competition with the IBM PC: the [[Apple II]], early [[Apple Macintosh]], the [[Commodore 64]] and others did not use the 808x processor; many 808x machines of different architectures used custom versions of MS-DOS. At first all these machines were in competition. In time the IBM PC hardware configuration became dominant in the 808x market as software written to communicate directly with the PC hardware without using standard operating system calls ran much faster, but on true PC-compatibles only. Non-PC-compatible 808x machines were too small a market to have fast software written for them alone, and the market remained open only for IBM PCs and machines that closely imitated their architecture, all running either a single version of MS-DOS compatible only with PCs, or the equivalent IBM PC DOS. Most clones cost much less than IBM-branded machines of similar performance, and became widely used by home users, while IBM PCs had a large share of the business computer market.\n\nMicrosoft and IBM together began what was intended as the follow-on to MS-DOS/PC DOS, called [[OS/2]]. When OS/2 was released in 1987, Microsoft began an advertising campaign announcing that \"DOS is Dead\" and stating that version 4 was the last full release. OS/2 was designed for efficient multi-tasking (as was standard in operating systems since 1963) and offered a number of advanced features that had been designed together with similar [[look and feel]]; it was seen as the legitimate heir to the \"kludgy\" DOS platform.\n\nMS-DOS had grown in spurts, with many significant features being taken or duplicated from Microsoft's other products and operating systems. MS-DOS also grew by incorporating, by direct licensing or feature duplicating, the functionality of tools and utilities developed by independent companies, such as [[Norton Utilities]], [[PC Tools (Central Point Software)|PC Tools]] ([[Microsoft Anti-Virus]]), [[QEMM]] expanded memory manager, [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Stac|Stacker]] [[disk compression]], and others.\n\nDuring the period when Digital Research was competing in the operating system market some computers, like [[Amstrad PC1512]], were sold with floppy disks for two operating systems (only one of which could be used at a time), MS-DOS and CP/M-86 or a derivative of it. Digital Research produced [[DOS Plus]], which was compatible with MS-DOS 2.11, supported CP/M-86 programs, had additional features including multi-tasking, and could read and write disks in CP/M and MS-DOS format.\n\nWhile OS/2 was under protracted development, Digital Research released the MS-DOS compatible [[DR DOS]] 5.0, which included features only available as third-party add-ons for MS-DOS. Unwilling to lose any portion of the market, Microsoft responded by announcing the \"pending\" release of MS-DOS 5.0 in May 1990. This effectively killed most DR DOS sales until the actual release of MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991. Digital Research brought out DR DOS 6.0, which sold well until the \"pre-announcement\" of MS-DOS 6.0 again stifled the sales of DR DOS.\n\nMicrosoft had been accused of carefully orchestrating leaks about future versions of MS-DOS in an attempt to create what in the industry is called FUD ([[fear, uncertainty, and doubt]]) regarding DR DOS. For example, in October 1990, shortly after the release of DR DOS 5.0, and long before the eventual June 1991 release of MS-DOS 5.0, stories on feature enhancements in MS-DOS started to appear in ''InfoWorld'' and ''PC Week''. [[Brad Silverberg]], then Vice President of Systems Software at Microsoft and general manager of its Windows and MS-DOS Business Unit, wrote a forceful letter to ''PC Week'' (November 5, 1990), denying that Microsoft was engaged in FUD tactics (\"to serve our customers better, we decided to be more forthcoming about version 5.0\") and denying that Microsoft copied features from DR DOS:\n\n<blockquote>\"The feature enhancements of MS-DOS version 5.0 were decided and development was begun long before we heard about DR DOS 5.0. There will be some similar features. With 50 million MS-DOS users, it shouldn't be surprising that DRI has heard some of the same requests from customers that we have.\"&nbsp;\u2013 (Schulman et al. 1994).<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\">{{cite book |author-first1=Andrew |author-last1=Schulman |author-first2=Ralf D. |author-last2=Brown |author-link2=Ralf D.

Much of Microsoft's further contributions to OS/2 also went into creating a third [[GUI]] replacement for DOS, [[Windows NT]].\n\nIBM, which had already been developing the next version of OS/2, carried on development of the platform without Microsoft and sold it as the alternative to DOS and Windows.\n\n==Legal issues==\nAs a response to [[Digital Research]]'s [[DR DOS 6.0]], which bundled SuperStor disk compression, Microsoft opened negotiations with [[Stac Electronics]], vendor of the most popular DOS disk compression tool, Stacker. In the [[due diligence]] process, Stac engineers had shown Microsoft part of the Stacker source code. Stac was unwilling to meet Microsoft's terms for licensing Stacker and withdrew from the negotiations. Microsoft chose to license Vertisoft's DoubleDisk, using it as the core for its DoubleSpace disk compression.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec6/art1.htm |title=How Safe is Disk Compression? |date=February 1994 |work=[[BYTE Magazine]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619060529/http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec6/art1.htm |archive-date=June 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMS-DOS 6.0 and 6.20 were released in 1993, both including the Microsoft DoubleSpace disk compression utility program. Stac successfully sued Microsoft for patent infringement regarding the compression algorithm used in DoubleSpace. This resulted in the 1994 release of MS-DOS 6.21, which had disk compression removed. Shortly afterwards came version 6.22, with a new version of the disk compression system, DriveSpace, which had a different compression algorithm to avoid the infringing code.\n\nPrior to 1995, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS (and Windows) to computer manufacturers under three types of agreement: per-processor (a fee for each system the company sold), per-system (a fee for each system of a particular model), or per-copy (a fee for each copy of MS-DOS installed). The largest manufacturers used the per-processor arrangement, which had the lowest fee. This arrangement made it expensive for the large manufacturers to migrate to any other operating system, such as DR DOS. In 1991, the U.S. government [[Federal Trade Commission]] began investigating Microsoft's licensing procedures, resulting in a 1994 settlement agreement limiting Microsoft to per-copy licensing. Digital Research did not gain by this settlement, and years later its successor in interest, [[Caldera, Inc.|Caldera]], sued Microsoft for damages in the ''[[Caldera v. Microsoft]]'' lawsuit. It was believed that the settlement ran in the order of $150&nbsp;million, but was revealed in November 2009 with the release of the Settlement Agreement to be $280&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Groklaw_2009_NovellWP\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091120165256836 |title=Exhibits to Microsoft's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment in Novell WordPerfect Case |date=November 23, 2009 |website=[[Groklaw]] |access-date=October 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Use of undocumented APIs==\nMicrosoft also used a variety of tactics in MS-DOS and several of their applications and development tools that, while operating perfectly when running on genuine MS-DOS (and PC DOS), would break when run on another vendor's implementation of DOS. Notable examples of this practice included:\n* [[Microsoft Pascal|Microsoft's QuickPascal]] released in early 1989 was the first MS product that checked for MS-DOS by modifying the program's [[Program Segment Prefix]] using undocumented DOS functions, and then checked whether or not the associated value changed in a fixed position within the DOS data segment (also undocumented). This check also made it into later MS products, including Microsoft [[QuickC]] v2.5, Programmer's Workbench and Microsoft C v6.0.<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\"/>\n* The [[AARD code]], a block of code in the windows launcher (WIN.COM) and a few other system files of Windows 3.1. It was XOR encrypted, [[Self-modifying code|self-modifying]], and deliberately obfuscated, using various undocumented DOS structures and functions to determine whether or not Windows really was running on MS-DOS.<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\"/> In the beta versions, it displayed an \"error\" message if the test for genuine MS-DOS failed, prompting the user to abort or continue, with abort the default. In the final release version, the code still ran, but the message and prompt were disabled by an added flag byte, rendering it (probably) ineffectual.\n** Note that the Windows 3.0 beta code only gave a warning that Windows would not operate properly on a \"foreign\" OS. It did, in fact, run just fine on DR DOS 6.0.\n* Interrupt routines called by Windows to inform MS-DOS that Windows is starting/exiting, information that MS-DOS retained in an IN_WINDOWS flag, in spite of the fact that MS-DOS and Windows were supposed to be two separate products.<ref name=\"undocumenteddos\"/>\n\n==End of MS-DOS==\n[[File:US Navy 110129-N-7676W-152 Culinary Specialist 3rd Class John Smith uses the existing DOS-based food service management system aboard the aircraft.jpg|thumb|{{As of|2011}}, MS-DOS is still used in some enterprises to run legacy applications, such as this [[United States Navy|US Navy]] food service management system.]]\nThe introduction of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990, with an easy-to-use [[graphical user interface]], marked the beginning of the end for the command-line driven MS-DOS. With the release of [[Windows 95]] (and continuing in the [[Windows 9x]] product line through to [[Windows Me]]), an integrated version of MS-DOS was used for [[bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapping]], troubleshooting, and backwards-compatibility with old DOS software, particularly games, and no longer released as a standalone product.<ref name=\"Goldstein 2017\">{{cite news |author-last=Goldstein |author-first=Phil |title=MS-DOS Became Synonymous with PC Operating Systems in the 1980s |url=https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2017/10/ms-dos-became-synonymous-pc-operating-systems-1980s |access-date=January 26, 2018 |publisher=BizTech Magazine |date=October 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126161504/https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2017/10/ms-dos-became-synonymous-pc-operating-systems-1980s |archive-date=January 26, 2018}}</ref> In Windows 95, the DOS, called MS-DOS 7, can be booted separately, without the Windows GUI; this capability was retained through Windows 98 Second Edition. Windows Me removed the capability to boot its underlying MS-DOS 8.0 alone from a hard disk, but retained the ability to make a DOS boot floppy disk (called an \"Emergency Boot Disk\") and can be hacked to restore full access to the underlying DOS.\n\nIn contrast to the Windows 9x series, the [[Windows NT]]-derived 32-bit operating systems developed alongside the 9x series ([[Windows NT]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]] and newer) do not contain MS-DOS as part of the operating system, as NT is not built as a subsystem running on DOS but an entirely different independent operating system,<ref name=\"Goldstein 2017\"/> but provide a subset of DOS emulation to run DOS applications and provide DOS-like command prompt windows.

Starting with Windows 10, the ability to create a DOS startup disk has been removed and so either a [[virtual machine]] running MS-DOS or an older version (in a virtual machine or dual boot) must be used to format a floppy disk, or an image must be obtained from an external source. Other solutions include using DOS compatible alternatives, such as [[FreeDOS]] or even copying the required files and boot sector themselves.\n\nMS-DOS 6.22 was the last standalone version produced by Microsoft for [[Intel 8088]], [[Intel 8086]], and [[Intel 80286]] processors, which remain available for download via their [[MSDN]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Supplemental Disk&nbsp;\u2014 MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx |publisher=Microsoft Developer Network |access-date=January 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902225102/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx |archive-date=September 2, 2017}}</ref> volume license, and OEM license partner websites, for customers with valid login credentials. MS-DOS is still used in embedded x86 systems due to its simple architecture and minimal memory and processor requirements, though some current products have switched to the still-maintained open-source alternative [[FreeDOS#Commercial uses|FreeDOS]].\n\nIn 2018, Microsoft released the [https://github.com/Microsoft/MS-DOS source code for MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0] on [[GitHub]]. The purpose of this, according to Microsoft, is mainly for education and experimentation with historic operating systems and for new programmers to gain an understanding of how low-level software works, both historic and current.\n\nDue to the historical nature of the software, Microsoft will not accept any [[pull request]]s to the code; only pull requests for modified and translated documentation will be accepted. Users, however, are allowed and fully encouraged to [[Fork (software development)|fork]] the repository containing the MS-DOS source code and make their own modifications, and do whatever they like with it.\n\n==Windows command-line interface==\nAll versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] have had an MS-DOS-like [[command-line interface]] (CLI) called [[Command Prompt]]. This could run many DOS and variously Win32, OS/2 1.x and [[POSIX]] command line utilities in the same command-line session, allowing piping between commands. The user interface, and the icon up to Windows 2000, followed the native MS-DOS interface.\n\nThe [[16-bit]] versions of Windows (up to 3.11) ran as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on top of MS-DOS. With [[Windows 95]], 98, 98 SE and Me, the MS-DOS part was (superficially) integrated, treating the MS-DOS operating system and the Windows GUI as a complete package, though the DOS component could actually stand alone. The command line accessed the DOS command line (usually <code>COMMAND.COM</code>) through a Windows module (WINOLDAP.MOD).{{clarify|date=August 2015}}\n\nA new line of Windows, (Windows NT), boot through a kernel whose sole purpose is to load Windows. One cannot run Win32 applications in the loader system in the manner that OS/2, UNIX or Consumer Windows can launch character-mode sessions.\n\nThe command session permits running of various supported command line utilities from Win32, MS-DOS, OS/2 1.x and POSIX. The emulators for MS-DOS, OS/2 and POSIX use the host's window in the same way that Win16 applications use the Win32 explorer. Using the host's window allows one to pipe output between emulations.\n\nThe MS-DOS emulation is done through the [[NTVDM]] (NT Virtual DOS Machine). This is a modified [[SoftPC]] (a former product similar to [[VirtualPC]]), running a modified MS-DOS 5 (NTIO.SYS and NTDOS.SYS). The output is handled by the console DLLs, so that the program at the prompt (<code>CMD.EXE</code>, <code>4NT.EXE</code>, <code>TCC.EXE</code>), can see the output. 64-bit Windows does not have either the DOS emulation, or the DOS commands EDIT, [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]], [[EDLIN]]), that come with 32-bit Windows.\n\nThe DOS version returns 5.00 or 5.50, depending on which API function is used to determine it. Utilities from MS-DOS 5.00 run in this emulation without modification. The very early beta programs of NT show MS-DOS 30.00, but programs running in MS-DOS 30.00 would assume that OS/2 was in control.\n\nThe OS/2 emulation is handled through OS2SS.EXE and OS2.EXE, and DOSCALLS.DLL. OS2.EXE is a version of the OS/2 shell (CMD.EXE), which passes commands down to the OS2SS.EXE, and input-output to the Windows NT shell. Windows 2000 was the last version of NT to support OS/2. The emulation is OS/2 1.30.\n\nPOSIX is emulated through the POSIX shell, but no emulated shell; the commands are handled directly in CMD.EXE.\n\nThe Command Prompt is often called the MS-DOS prompt. In part, this was the official name for it in Windows 9x and early versions of Windows NT (NT 3.5 and earlier), and in part because the SoftPC emulation of DOS redirects output into it. Actually only <code>COMMAND.COM</code> and other 16-bit commands run in an NTVDM with <code>AUTOEXEC.NT</code> and <code>CONFIG.NT</code> initialisation determined by <code>[[Program information file|_DEFAULT.PIF]]</code>, optionally permitting the use of [[Win32 console]] applications and internal commands with an <code>NTCMDPROMPT</code> directive.\n\n[[Win32 console]] applications use <code>CMD.EXE</code> as their command prompt shell. This confusion does not exist under OS/2 because there are separate DOS and OS/2 prompts, and running a DOS program under OS/2 will launch a separate DOS window to run the application.\n\nAll versions of Windows for [[Itanium]] (no longer sold by Microsoft) and [[x86-64]] architectures no longer include the NTVDM and can therefore no longer natively run DOS or 16-bit Windows applications. There are alternatives in the form of [[virtual machine]] emulators such as Microsoft's own [[Virtual PC]], as well as [[VMware]], [[DOSBox]], and others.\n\n==Legacy compatibility==\nFrom 1983 onwards, various companies worked on [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) capable of running on PC hardware. However, this required duplicated effort and did not provide much consistency in interface design (even between products from the same company).\n\nLater, in 1985, [[Microsoft Windows 1.0]] was released as Microsoft's first attempt at providing a consistent user interface (for applications). The early versions of Windows ran on top of MS-DOS. At first Windows met with little success, but this was also true for most other companies' efforts as well, for example [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]. After version 3.0, Windows gained market acceptance.\n\n[[Windows 9x]] used the DOS boot process to launch into protected mode. Basic features related to the file system, such as long file names, were only available to DOS when running as a subsystem of Windows. [[Windows NT]] runs independently of DOS but includes [[NTVDM]], a component for simulating a DOS environment for legacy applications.\n\n==Related systems==\n{{main|DOS}}\nMS-DOS compatible systems include:\n* [[IBM PC DOS]]\n* [[DR DOS]], [[Novell DOS]], [[OpenDOS]]\n* [[FreeDOS]]\n* [[PTS-DOS]]\n* [[ROM-DOS]]\n\nMicrosoft manufactured [[IBM PC DOS]] for IBM.

He was born in 1756 in [[Seoul]]. His father was Soam Yi Dong-uk (\u8607\u5dd6 \u674e\u6771\u90c1, 1739-?) who rose to the rank of ''champan'' (vice-minister) and, after possible initial interest, fiercely opposed the spread of Catholic teachings. His mother was a sister of Yi Ga-hwan (\u674e\u5bb6\u7165, 1742-1801), one of the Catholics executed with him in 1801. Yi Seung-hun first came into contact with Catholicism via [[Yi Byeok]] in 1779. In 1783-4, he accompanied his father on a diplomatic mission to [[Beijing]], [[China]], and on the suggestion of Yi Byeok contacted the Catholic priests there. He was baptised in Beijing in the spring of 1784. This was the first time that a member of the Korean [[yangban]] class was formally baptised as a Christian and he returned to Korea with books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts. Yi Byeok then seems to have taken some time to study the books before declaring himself convinced. He then set about evangelizing those around him, including Gwon Cheol-sin and his younger brother Gwon Il-sin. This was also the moment when he spoke of the Catholic faith to the brothers Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-jeon, and Jeong Yak-Yong (who recorded the event in his epitaph ''myojimyeong.''<ref>Jean Sangbae Ri. Confucius et Jesus Christ. Paris: Beauchesne. 1979. page 26</ref>\n\nIt was only after Yi Byeok felt fully convinced that he authorized Yi Seung-hun to baptise himself and the other converts to Catholicism. Early in 1785 the growing group of believers and sympathizers in Seoul moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where [[Myeongdong Cathedral]] now stands. Almost immediately the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. Yi Seung-hun was among those named in the official report of the incident.<ref>Jean Sangbae Ri. Confucius et Jesus Christ. Paris: Beauchesne. 1979. page 29-30</ref> After the death of Yi Byeok later that year, Yi Seung-hun took over his role in the group. In the spring of 1786, as there were yet no formally ordained priests in Korea, Various leading Korean laymen, including Choi Chang-Hyon, Yi Tan-won, began acting as \"temporary clerics\". In 1789, however, the Korean Catholics were informed by the [[bishop]] in [[Beijing]], Mgr. Gouvea, that such practices were contrary to Church teachings and that they should cease.<ref>Jean Sangbae Ri. Confucius et Jesus Christ. Paris: Beauchesne. 1979. page 31</ref> There would be no ordained priest in Korea until 1795, when the Chinese priest [[Zhu Wenmiao]] arrived, at which time the Church had grown to over 4000 members. Yi Seung-hun and [[Jeong Yak-jong]] were the main leaders of the community in Seoul after the death of Yi Byeok in 1786. Yi Seung-hun's wife was Jeong Yak-jong's sister.\n\nIn 1801, the Korean Catholic Church was subject to the first major repression by the government (the Sinyu Persecution) in which more than 300 people were killed. Yi was martyred by beheading on the 26th of the 2nd lunar month (April 8), 1801. This incident has come to be known as the [[Catholic Persecution of 1801]]. Little written material remains from this period but a collection of texts by several of the first believers, known as ''Mancheon yugo'' (\u8513\u5ddd\u907a\u7a3f), was discovered in about 1970. ''Mancheon'' was the ''ho'' of '''Yi Seung-hun''', whose writings occupy a major part of the book, together with texts written by Yi Byeok etc. It is not known when or by whom the collection was made, and although it is sometimes claimed to be in the handwriting of [[Jeong Yak-yong]], this does not seem to be the case.<ref>Jean Sangbae Ri.
