The concept of male grooming has become increasingly visible in popular culture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.joins.com/article/19760048|title=\uafb8\ubbf8\ub294 \ub0a8\uc131 '\uadf8\ub8e8\ubc0d\uc871'|last=\uac15|first=\ud0dc\uc6b0|date=2016-03-22|work=JoongAng Ilbo|access-date=2018-10-29|language=ko-KR|trans-title=Decorating male Groomingjok}}</ref>\n\n== Background and History ==\nThe history of male grooming dates back to the ancient [[Egypt]] civilization. Scholars consider the discovery of copper razors and oil on the skin as the origin of \"grooming.\" When [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] conquered the world and encouraged short and neat hairstyles, it made men feel less aware of the fashion trends of absolute monarchs such as [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and more conscious of the fashions of their peers. Development of [[women's rights]] movements is another reason for the growth of interest in male grooming. As women continued to enter the workforce, it was believed men can compete if they also take good care of their appearance, an idea described as \u2018body capital\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00002410.htm|title=\"Body work\": physical capital, habitus and the field of school|last=Holroyd|first=Rachel|date=2003-01-23|website=www.leeds.ac.uk|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref> Trend research institute \u2018Interfashion Planning\u2019 stated that \u201cMen's enthusiasm for good looks is not a sudden trend.

In other words, men have decided to wear makeup to survive and compete during a severe job shortage. The [[Korean Wave]], including [[K-pop]], is heavily influential. As pop [[Kpop idol|idol]]<nowiki/>s in their 20s and so-called \"flower boys\" <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42499809|title='Flowerboys' and the appeal of 'soft masculinity'|date=2018-09-05|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-GB}}</ref>have become popular, the perception of men's makeup has changed. While it was once common for men who wore makeup to think of a [[Drag queen|Drag Queen]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in western cultures, [[South Korea|Korean]] male idols are different. They generally have clean skin, soft eyes, and delicate emotions, but perform dynamic and masculine duties. Men are encouraged to copy the makeup of Korean male idols. In fashion and beauty magazines overseas, there are many articles on skin care and  makeup tutorials for Korean pop stars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2018/08/27/2018082700739.html|title=\uc0e4\ub12c, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0a8\uc131 \ud654\uc7a5\ud488 \uccab \ucd9c\uc2dc...\uc138\uacc4 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 '\ud654\uc7a5\ub0a8'|last=\uae40|first=\uc740\uc601|date=2018-08-27|work=Chosun.com|access-date=2018-11-12|language=ko|trans-title=Chanel, the first male cosmetics to be released in Korea...Korea's 'Grooming male' led by the global market}}</ref>\n\n=== The State of Grooming in China===\nAs a \"woman-like man\" has become a new trend in China, a growing number of young men are interested in makeup. Internet broadcasters and beauty [[bloggers]] who produce makeup videos for men have increased rapidly. Accordingly, the men's cosmetics industry has shown rapid growth in China.

Development of [[women's rights]] movements is another reason for the growth of interest in male grooming. As women continued to enter the workforce, it was believed men can compete if they also take good care of their appearance, an idea described as \u2018body capital\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00002410.htm|title=\"Body work\": physical capital, habitus and the field of school|last=Holroyd|first=Rachel|date=2003-01-23|website=www.leeds.ac.uk|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref> Trend research institute \u2018Interfashion Planning\u2019 stated that \u201cMen's enthusiasm for good looks is not a sudden trend.

Since then, over 20 million people worldwide have died due to motor vehicle accidents.{{synthesis inline|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe need for a means of analyzing and mitigating the effects of motor vehicle accidents on humans was felt soon after commercial production of automobiles began in the late 1890s, and by the 1930s, when the automobile became a common part of daily life and the number of motor vehicle deaths were rising. Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles and were continuing to climb.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 1930 cars had [[dashboard]]s of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against the interior of the automobile or through the [[windshield]]. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, [[List of automobile manufacturers|car manufacturers]] were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Cadaver testing===\n[[File:B11510P002.jpg|thumb|Cadaver used during a frontal impact test.]]\n[[Detroit]]'s [[Wayne State University]] was the first to begin serious work on collecting data on the effects of high-speed collisions on the human body. In the late 1930s there was no reliable data on how the human body responds to the sudden, violent forces acting on it in an automobile accident. Furthermore, no effective tools existed to measure such responses.\n[[Biomechanics]] was a field barely in its infancy. It was therefore necessary to employ two types of test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.\n\nThe first test subjects were human [[cadaver]]s. They were used to obtain fundamental information about the human body's ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a high-speed accident. To such an end, steel [[ball bearing]]s were dropped on [[human skull|skulls]], and bodies were dumped down unused [[elevator]] shafts onto steel plates. Cadavers fitted with crude [[accelerometer]]s were strapped into automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.\n\nAlbert King's 1995 ''Journal of Trauma'' article, \"Humanitarian Benefits of Cadaver Research on Injury Prevention\", clearly states the value in human lives saved as a result of cadaver research. King's calculations indicate that as a result of design changes implemented up to 1987, cadaver research since saved 8,500 lives annually.<ref>King, A.I., Viano, D.C., Mizeres, N., & States, J. D. (1995). Humanitarian benefits of cadaver research on injury prevention. ''Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection & Critical Care,'' ''38''(4) 564-569. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/toc/1995/04000</nowiki></ref> He notes that for every cadaver used, each year 61 people survive due to wearing [[seat belt]]s, 147 live due to [[air bag]]s, and 68 survive windshield impact.\n\nHowever, work with cadavers presented almost as many problems as it resolved. Not only were there the [[morals|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] issues related to working with the dead, but there were also research concerns. The majority of cadavers available were older adults males who had died non-violent deaths; they did not represent a [[demography|demographic]] cross-section of accident victims. Deceased accident victims could not be employed because any data that might be collected from such experimental subjects would be compromised by the cadaver's previous injuries. Since no two cadavers are the same, and since any specific part of a cadaver could only be used once, it was extremely difficult to achieve reliable comparison data. In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and [[public opinion]] made them effectively unusable. Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce. As a result, [[biometric]] data were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.\n\nVery little attention has been paid to obesity and car crash studies, and it is hard to obtain an obese dummy for the experiment. Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to automobile accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person.<ref name=\"cushion\" /> At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a \"cushioning effect.\" <ref name=\"cushion\">{{cite journal|last1=Kent|first1=Richard|title=Is There Really a \"Cushion Effect\"?: A Biomechanical Investigation of Crash Injury Mechanisms in the Obese|journal=Obesity|date=2010|volume=18|issue=4|pages=749\u2013753|doi=10.1038/oby.2009.315|pmid=19798067}}</ref>\n\nThe use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were implemented inside Cadavers brains to focus on the impact and separation of the brain and skull. NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers to look at a specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation. It also helped to establish and develop the FE model. To measure neck injuries for three year olds, the model FE was created. A real child's neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model.

While data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests that exceeded a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of test subject.\n\n=== Animal testing ===\nBy the mid-1950s, the bulk of the information cadaver testing could provide had been collected. It was also necessary to collect data on accident survivability, research for which cadavers were woefully inadequate. In concert with the shortage of cadavers, this need forced researchers to seek other models. A description by [[Mary Roach]] of the ''Eighth Stapp Car Crash and Field Demonstration Conference'' shows the direction in which research had begun to move. \"We saw [[chimpanzee]]s riding rocket sleds, a [[bear]] on an impact swing...We observed a [[pig]], [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] and placed in a sitting position on the swing in the harness, crashed into a deep-dish steering wheel at about 10 mph.\"<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/health/col/roac/1999/11/19/crash_test/index1.html I was a human crash-test dummy] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125034009/http://archive.salon.com/health/col/roac/1999/11/19/crash_test/index1.html |date=November 25, 2005}} (November 19, 1999).</ref>\n\nOne important research objective that could not be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by [[impalement]] on the [[steering column]]. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from [[steering wheel]] impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by [[General Motors]] in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column reduced the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.\n\nPigs were used for steering wheel impacts because they have an internal structure similar to humans, and can be easily placed correctly via sitting upright in the vehicle.<ref name=\"live animals3\">{{Cite journal|date=1980|title=Live Animals in Car Crash Studies|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=acwp_arte|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|pages=214\u2013217|last1=Heneson|first1=Nancy|access-date=26 March 2016}}</ref> The ability to sit upright was an important requirement for test animals so that another common fatal injury among human victims, [[decapitation]], could be studied. Additionally, it was important for researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a [[dashboard]] with too little padding or padding that was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, it was essential to determine which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. [[Rear-view mirror]] impact is a significant occurrence in a [[Traffic collision|frontal collision]]: How should a mirror be built so that it is rigid enough to perform its task, yet of low injury risk if struck?\n\nWhile work with cadavers had aroused some opposition, primarily from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no [[pain]], and the indignity of their situations was directly related to easing the pain of the living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{Cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=Tyler|title=Auto Safety Crash Testing Ignites Furor : Germany: The program uses human bodies.

Animal testing is no longer practiced by any of the major automobile makers; General Motors discontinued live testing in 1993 and other manufacturers followed suit shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1980, animals such as bears and pigs were tested in car crash stimulations. This led to moral dilemmas and was not the first time that animals were used in car crashes. In 1978, The [[University of Michigan]] Highway Safety Research Institute used baboons as a substitute for human test subjects in car crashes. Although there was the objection of animal cruelty that arose, there was also the controversy of how they are similar to humans and can be used as a sufficient testing substitution for us.<ref name=\"live animals\" /> The researchers did not end up stopping the use of baboons because of moral objections, but instead stopped because they had collected sufficient data. The moral inputs from other people and organizations were inconsistent, which caused implications when deciding to ban healthy animals from research testing.

The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data are needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars.<ref name=\"live animals\" /> Years later, animal testing ceased and instead an instrumented dummy was created as a replacement. In 1978, animals were their only subjects that could be a reliable substitution for the human being. The disadvantage, though, to using an instrumented dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as a live animal.<ref name=\"live animals\" /> By 1991, the use of animals in vehicle collision tests was in decline because of advances in computers and technology.<ref name=\"new york\" /> It is difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families of the deceased.

Lightweight Helmet]</ref> and pilot restraint harnesses. This testing involved the use of high acceleration to 1000&nbsp;km/h (600&nbsp;mph) rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate. In the early 1950s, Alderson and Grumman produced a dummy which was used to conduct crash tests in both motor vehicles and aircraft. The original \"Sierra Sam\" was a 95th percentile male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).\n\nAlderson went on to produce what it called the VIP-50 series, built specifically for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], but which was also adopted by the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. Sierra followed up with a competitor dummy, a model it called \"Sierra Stan\".\n\n===Hybrid I and II===\n[[File:HS117-399.jpg|thumb|left|Two uninstrumented Hybrid II 50th percentile male dummies used as ballast in a low speed collision test.]]\n\nGeneral Motors, who had taken over the impetus in developing a reliable and durable dummy, found neither Sierra model satisfied its needs. GM engineers decided to combine the best features of the VIP series and Sierra Stan, and so in 1971 Hybrid I was born.\nHybrid I was what is known as a \"50th [[percentile]] male\" dummy. That is to say, it modeled an average male in height, mass, and proportion. In cooperation with the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE), GM shared this design, and a subsequent 5th percentile female dummy, with its competitors.\n\nSince then, considerable work has gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy to comply with the American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov |title=NHTSA|date=2019-03-13}}</ref> undertook an agreement with [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II's performance in a number of specific areas.<ref>[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/49cfr572.31.pdf NHTSA 49 CFR 572.31 Subpart E\u2014Hybrid III Test Dummy]</ref>\n\nThough a great improvement over cadavers for standardized testing purposes, Hybrid I and Hybrid II were still very crude, and their use was limited to developing and testing [[seat belt]] designs. A dummy was needed which would allow researchers to explore injury-reduction strategies. It was this need that pushed GM researchers to develop the current Hybrid line, the Hybrid III family of crash test dummies.\n\n===Hybrid III family===\n[[File:Hybridlll.jpg|thumbnail|The original 50th percentile male Hybrid III's family expanded to include a 95th percentile male, 5th percentile female, and ten, six, and three-year-old child dummies.]]\n{{main article|Hybrid III}}\nHybrid III, the 50th percentile male dummy which made its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, and he is now a family man.

Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation. Then the head and neck are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear [[chamois leather]] skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the [[human rib cage|rib]]s bend and flex as they should.\n\nWhen the dummy has been determined to be ready for testing, calibration marks are fastened to the side of the head to aid researchers when slow-motion [[film]]s are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the [[ankle]], record between 30&nbsp;000 and 35&nbsp;000 data items in a typical 100\u2013150&nbsp;[[millisecond]] crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's [[chest]], these data are downloaded to [[computer]] once the test is complete.\n\nBecause the Hybrid is a standardized data collection device, any part of a particular Hybrid type is interchangeable with any other. Not only can one dummy be tested several times, but if a part should fail, it can be replaced with a new part. A fully instrumented dummy is worth about [[Euro|\u20ac]]150,000.<ref>[http://crash.citroenz.biz/how-tests-r-done.html How the Test are done] (19 March 2003).

In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained.<ref name=\":0\" /> The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions.<ref name=\":0\" /> A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Specialized dummies===\nHybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]]s.

Since then, over 20 million people worldwide have died due to motor vehicle accidents.{{synthesis inline|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe need for a means of analyzing and mitigating the effects of motor vehicle accidents on humans was felt soon after commercial production of automobiles began in the late 1890s, and by the 1930s, when the automobile became a common part of daily life and the number of motor vehicle deaths were rising. Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles and were continuing to climb.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 1930 cars had [[dashboard]]s of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against the interior of the automobile or through the [[windshield]]. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, [[List of automobile manufacturers|car manufacturers]] were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Cadaver testing===\n[[File:B11510P002.jpg|thumb|Cadaver used during a frontal impact test.]]\n[[Detroit]]'s [[Wayne State University]] was the first to begin serious work on collecting data on the effects of high-speed collisions on the human body. In the late 1930s there was no reliable data on how the human body responds to the sudden, violent forces acting on it in an automobile accident. Furthermore, no effective tools existed to measure such responses.\n[[Biomechanics]] was a field barely in its infancy. It was therefore necessary to employ two types of test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.\n\nThe first test subjects were human [[cadaver]]s. They were used to obtain fundamental information about the human body's ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a high-speed accident. To such an end, steel [[ball bearing]]s were dropped on [[human skull|skulls]], and bodies were dumped down unused [[elevator]] shafts onto steel plates. Cadavers fitted with crude [[accelerometer]]s were strapped into automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.\n\nAlbert King's 1995 ''Journal of Trauma'' article, \"Humanitarian Benefits of Cadaver Research on Injury Prevention\", clearly states the value in human lives saved as a result of cadaver research. King's calculations indicate that as a result of design changes implemented up to 1987, cadaver research since saved 8,500 lives annually.<ref>King, A.I., Viano, D.C., Mizeres, N., & States, J. D. (1995). Humanitarian benefits of cadaver research on injury prevention. ''Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection & Critical Care,'' ''38''(4) 564-569. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/toc/1995/04000</nowiki></ref> He notes that for every cadaver used, each year 61 people survive due to wearing [[seat belt]]s, 147 live due to [[air bag]]s, and 68 survive windshield impact.\n\nHowever, work with cadavers presented almost as many problems as it resolved. Not only were there the [[morals|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] issues related to working with the dead, but there were also research concerns. The majority of cadavers available were older adults males who had died non-violent deaths; they did not represent a [[demography|demographic]] cross-section of accident victims. Deceased accident victims could not be employed because any data that might be collected from such experimental subjects would be compromised by the cadaver's previous injuries. Since no two cadavers are the same, and since any specific part of a cadaver could only be used once, it was extremely difficult to achieve reliable comparison data. In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and [[public opinion]] made them effectively unusable. Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce. As a result, [[biometric]] data were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.\n\nVery little attention has been paid to obesity and car crash studies, and it is hard to obtain an obese dummy for the experiment. Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to automobile accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person.<ref name=\"cushion\" /> At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a \"cushioning effect.\" <ref name=\"cushion\">{{cite journal|last1=Kent|first1=Richard|title=Is There Really a \"Cushion Effect\"?: A Biomechanical Investigation of Crash Injury Mechanisms in the Obese|journal=Obesity|date=2010|volume=18|issue=4|pages=749\u2013753|doi=10.1038/oby.2009.315|pmid=19798067}}</ref>\n\nThe use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were implemented inside Cadavers brains to focus on the impact and separation of the brain and skull.

A description by [[Mary Roach]] of the ''Eighth Stapp Car Crash and Field Demonstration Conference'' shows the direction in which research had begun to move. \"We saw [[chimpanzee]]s riding rocket sleds, a [[bear]] on an impact swing...We observed a [[pig]], [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] and placed in a sitting position on the swing in the harness, crashed into a deep-dish steering wheel at about 10 mph.\"<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/health/col/roac/1999/11/19/crash_test/index1.html I was a human crash-test dummy] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125034009/http://archive.salon.com/health/col/roac/1999/11/19/crash_test/index1.html |date=November 25, 2005}} (November 19, 1999).</ref>\n\nOne important research objective that could not be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by [[impalement]] on the [[steering column]]. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from [[steering wheel]] impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by [[General Motors]] in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column reduced the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.\n\nPigs were used for steering wheel impacts because they have an internal structure similar to humans, and can be easily placed correctly via sitting upright in the vehicle.<ref name=\"live animals3\">{{Cite journal|date=1980|title=Live Animals in Car Crash Studies|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=acwp_arte|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|pages=214\u2013217|last1=Heneson|first1=Nancy|access-date=26 March 2016}}</ref> The ability to sit upright was an important requirement for test animals so that another common fatal injury among human victims, [[decapitation]], could be studied. Additionally, it was important for researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a [[dashboard]] with too little padding or padding that was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, it was essential to determine which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. [[Rear-view mirror]] impact is a significant occurrence in a [[Traffic collision|frontal collision]]: How should a mirror be built so that it is rigid enough to perform its task, yet of low injury risk if struck?\n\nWhile work with cadavers had aroused some opposition, primarily from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no [[pain]], and the indignity of their situations was directly related to easing the pain of the living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{Cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=Tyler|title=Auto Safety Crash Testing Ignites Furor : Germany: The program uses human bodies.

Animal testing is no longer practiced by any of the major automobile makers; General Motors discontinued live testing in 1993 and other manufacturers followed suit shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1980, animals such as bears and pigs were tested in car crash stimulations. This led to moral dilemmas and was not the first time that animals were used in car crashes. In 1978, The [[University of Michigan]] Highway Safety Research Institute used baboons as a substitute for human test subjects in car crashes. Although there was the objection of animal cruelty that arose, there was also the controversy of how they are similar to humans and can be used as a sufficient testing substitution for us.<ref name=\"live animals\" /> The researchers did not end up stopping the use of baboons because of moral objections, but instead stopped because they had collected sufficient data. The moral inputs from other people and organizations were inconsistent, which caused implications when deciding to ban healthy animals from research testing.

The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data are needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars.<ref name=\"live animals\" /> Years later, animal testing ceased and instead an instrumented dummy was created as a replacement. In 1978, animals were their only subjects that could be a reliable substitution for the human being. The disadvantage, though, to using an instrumented dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as a live animal.<ref name=\"live animals\" /> By 1991, the use of animals in vehicle collision tests was in decline because of advances in computers and technology.<ref name=\"new york\" /> It is difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families of the deceased.

Lightweight Helmet]</ref> and pilot restraint harnesses. This testing involved the use of high acceleration to 1000&nbsp;km/h (600&nbsp;mph) rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate. In the early 1950s, Alderson and Grumman produced a dummy which was used to conduct crash tests in both motor vehicles and aircraft. The original \"Sierra Sam\" was a 95th percentile male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).\n\nAlderson went on to produce what it called the VIP-50 series, built specifically for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], but which was also adopted by the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. Sierra followed up with a competitor dummy, a model it called \"Sierra Stan\".\n\n===Hybrid I and II===\n[[File:HS117-399.jpg|thumb|left|Two uninstrumented Hybrid II 50th percentile male dummies used as ballast in a low speed collision test.]]\n\nGeneral Motors, who had taken over the impetus in developing a reliable and durable dummy, found neither Sierra model satisfied its needs. GM engineers decided to combine the best features of the VIP series and Sierra Stan, and so in 1971 Hybrid I was born.\nHybrid I was what is known as a \"50th [[percentile]] male\" dummy. That is to say, it modeled an average male in height, mass, and proportion. In cooperation with the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE), GM shared this design, and a subsequent 5th percentile female dummy, with its competitors.\n\nSince then, considerable work has gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy to comply with the American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov |title=NHTSA|date=2019-03-13}}</ref> undertook an agreement with [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II's performance in a number of specific areas.<ref>[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/49cfr572.31.pdf NHTSA 49 CFR 572.31 Subpart E\u2014Hybrid III Test Dummy]</ref>\n\nThough a great improvement over cadavers for standardized testing purposes, Hybrid I and Hybrid II were still very crude, and their use was limited to developing and testing [[seat belt]] designs. A dummy was needed which would allow researchers to explore injury-reduction strategies. It was this need that pushed GM researchers to develop the current Hybrid line, the Hybrid III family of crash test dummies.\n\n===Hybrid III family===\n[[File:Hybridlll.jpg|thumbnail|The original 50th percentile male Hybrid III's family expanded to include a 95th percentile male, 5th percentile female, and ten, six, and three-year-old child dummies.]]\n{{main article|Hybrid III}}\nHybrid III, the 50th percentile male dummy which made its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, and he is now a family man.

The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA255544&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Hybrid II and Hybrid III Dummy Neck Properties for Computer Modeling] (February 1992)</ref>\n\nThe Hybrid III dummy for three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, and does not provide the same physical outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When using data from the real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety.<ref name=\":0\" /> The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wencheng|first=Zhang|date=2008|title=Incorporation of Biomechanical Child Cadaver Neck Behaviour in a Child Model and Injury Prediction in Vehicle Frontal Crash|url=http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/1684087861/fmt/ai/rep/SPDF?hl=&cit%3Aauth=Zhang%2C+Wencheng&cit%3Atitle=Incorporation+of+biomechanical+child+cadaver+neck+behaviour+in+a+...&cit%3Apub=ProQuest+Dissertations+and+Theses&cit%3Avol=&cit%3Aiss=&cit%3Apg=n%2Fa&cit%3Adate=2008&ic=true&cit%3Aprod=ProQuest&_a=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%3D%3D&_s=ddkty0oDMV9mj9BgOEUwv63yBlM%3D|journal=|publisher=Heritage Branch|doi=|pmid=|access-date=18 April 2016|ref=Hybrid III}}</ref> Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThere are certain testing procedures for Hybrid IIIs to ensure that they obtain a correct humanlike neck flexure, and to ensure that they would react to a crash in a similar way that human bodies would. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n=== Warrior Injury Assessment Mannequin (WIAMan) ===\n\nWIAMan is a blast test dummy designed to assess potential skeletal injuries of soldiers exposed to under-body blast (UBB).

Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation. Then the head and neck are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear [[chamois leather]] skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the [[human rib cage|rib]]s bend and flex as they should.\n\nWhen the dummy has been determined to be ready for testing, calibration marks are fastened to the side of the head to aid researchers when slow-motion [[film]]s are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the [[ankle]], record between 30&nbsp;000 and 35&nbsp;000 data items in a typical 100\u2013150&nbsp;[[millisecond]] crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's [[chest]], these data are downloaded to [[computer]] once the test is complete.\n\nBecause the Hybrid is a standardized data collection device, any part of a particular Hybrid type is interchangeable with any other. Not only can one dummy be tested several times, but if a part should fail, it can be replaced with a new part. A fully instrumented dummy is worth about [[Euro|\u20ac]]150,000.<ref>[http://crash.citroenz.biz/how-tests-r-done.html How the Test are done] (19 March 2003).

In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained.<ref name=\":0\" /> The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions.<ref name=\":0\" /> A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Specialized dummies===\nHybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]]s.
