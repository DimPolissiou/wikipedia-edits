The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

The service proved so popular and profitable that further routes were soon established at [[Penzance]] and [[Slough]].\n\nBy the end of 1904, 36 buses were in operation, 10 more than were in service in [[London]]. When the Great Western Railway (Road Transport) Act was passed in 1928 the GWR had the largest railway bus fleet. This [[Act of Parliament|Act]] regularised the railway's operation of road services and also paved the way for them to be transferred out of the railway's control to bus companies, although the railway was to be a shareholder in these companies and there would still be an effort to co-ordinate to road and rail services.\n\n==Vehicles==\nThe first vehicles were 16&nbsp;hp Milnes-Daimler single-deck buses. They were soon supplemented by 20&nbsp;hp, and later, 30&nbsp;hp vehicles from the same company. Smaller numbers of vehicles were also supplied by [[Dennis Specialist Vehicles|Dennis]], [[D\u00fcrkopp]], [[Straker-Squire]], and [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]], as well as a few Clarkson 20&nbsp;hp [[steam bus]]es. Later buses were obtained from [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Daimler Company|Daimler]], [[Guy Motors|Guy]], [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]], [[Maudslay Motor Company|Maudslay]], [[Thornycroft]], and a few from Burford, [[Clement-Talbot]], [[Crossley Motors|Crossley]], [[Ford of Britain|Ford]], Gilford, Graham Dodge, [[International Harvester|International]], [[Lancia]], [[Morris Motors|Morris]], Overland BMT and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]].\n\nBuses for busier routes were double-deck, while some had luggage compartments for carrying mail bags. For tourist excursions, vehicles \u2013 known as \"Jersey Cars\" \u2013 were open, with seats arranged in tiers so that passengers sitting at the back could see over the heads of those in front. More familiar coach types were introduced later and were used on excursions and long-distance \"Land Cruises\".\n\n==Services in Devon and Cornwall==\nRoutes in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] were transferred to the new [[Western National]] Omnibus Company on 1 January 1929, which was half-owned by the Great Western Railway and half by the [[National Omnibus and Transport]] Company. Equivalent services are now operated [[First South West]] (in Cornwall) and [[Stagecoach Devon]]. In 1929 the railway also took 30% of the shares in the [[Devon General]] Omnibus and Touring Company, while the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] took 20%. At the same time, Western National routes around [[Bovey Tracey]] and [[Moretonhampstead]] were transferred to Devon General which has since become Stagecoach Devon.\n\n===Helston and Penzance===\nThe first service ran from [[Helston]] to [[The Lizard]], connecting with trains at [[Helston railway station]]. The service commenced on 17 August 1903, a trial run having been made two days earlier. The service was operated by the railway until the formation of Western National. Other services were operated to [[Mullion, Cornwall|Mullion]], [[Ruan Minor]], and [[Porthleven]]. A [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] to [[Penzance]] service via Helston was run from 11 July 1921.\n\nA service from Penzance to [[Marazion]] had been introduced on 31 October 1903 and ran until 6 August 1916, running beyond Penzance to [[Newlyn]] for the first few months. Another service was introduced on 16 May 1904 to [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]] which was often extended to [[Pendeen]] and [[Lands End]]. In 1922 services were introduced from Penzance through [[St Buryan]] to Lands End and various villages in the area. Two years later a short-lived service ran to [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]]. In 1925 new services were added from Helston to [[Redruth]], [[Gweek]], [[St Keverne]], [[Manaccan]].\n\nBus services today at Penzance continue to use a bus station adjacent to [[Penzance railway station]].\n\n===Plymouth and the South Hams===\nA service from [[Plymouth]] to [[Modbury]] was introduced later in 1904, with several local services from Modbury to [[Aveton Gifford]], [[Yealmpton]], [[Bigbury-on-Sea]], and [[Ivybridge]]. They also ran through [[Kingsbridge]] to [[Salcombe]] and [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. Further routes from Kingsbridge ran to [[Totnes]], [[Newton Abbot]], [[Thurlestone]] and [[Hope Cove]].\n\nA Plymouth to [[Roborough, South Hams|Roborough]] route ran from 12 September 1904 until 6 August 1916. Buses were kept underneath the [[viaduct]] upon which [[Plymouth Millbay railway station]] was built.\n\n===Torquay and Paignton===\nA service was introduced along the sea front, linking [[Paignton]] with [[Torquay]] on 11 July 1904. Another route was established from Paignton to [[Totnes]] on 20 April 1905, as well a short-lived one to [[Brixham]], and seasonal tours.\n\nThe bus station at Paignton is still opposite [[Paignton railway station]].\n\n===Redruth===\nServices from [[Redruth]] started on 29 July 1907 with a route to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. A network was established over the coming years that reached to [[Portreath]], [[Illogan]], [[St Day]], [[Carharrack]], [[St Keverne (Cornwall)|St Keverne]], and Helston.\n\nThe [[corrugated iron]] railway bus garage still stands behind [[Redruth railway station]], although no longer used for its original purpose.\n\n===St Austell===\nThe first services from [[St Austell]] were that to [[St Columb Road railway station|St Columb Road]] via [[St Dennis, Cornwall|St Dennis]] on 3 August 1908 and to [[Bugle, Cornwall|Bugle]] and [[Bodmin]] the following month. Other routes were added to [[Charlestown, Cornwall|Charlestown]], [[Pentewan]] (3 August 1908), [[Newquay]] (29 May 1910), [[Truro]] (1911), [[Trenarren]] (1 August 1911), [[St Blazey]], [[Treviscoe]] (2 October 1911), [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] (1 October 1920), [[Tywardreath]] and [[Fowey]], also [[Portscatho]] (9 October 1923), [[Mevagissey]] (17 December 1923), [[Gorran Haven]], [[Roche, Cornwall|Roche]] (9 July 1928).\n\nThe bus station at St Austell is still situated outside [[St Austell railway station]] in what used to be the railway goods yard.\n\n===Other services===\nA service ran from [[Saltash railway station]] to [[Callington, Cornwall|Callington]] from 1 June 1904 to test the market for a proposed [[light railway]], but continued as a bus service until 30 September 1911.\n\n[[Moretonhampstead railway station]] was a focal point for tours on [[Dartmoor]], and a regular service to [[Chagford]] ran from 9 April 1906 until 31 December 1928. Other routes in the area ran from [[Bovey railway station]] to [[Newton Abbot]] and tourist spots such as [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]] and [[Haytor]].\n\n==Services elsewhere in England==\n===Slough===\nOne of the railway's earliest routes was that from [[Slough railway station]] to [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, opened on 1 March 1904. Routes to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] followed on 18 July 1904 and to [[Burnham Beeches]] on 1 May 1908, extended to [[Taplow]] in 1927.\n\n===Cotswolds===\nServices from [[Stroud railway station]] were introduced on 9 January 1905 to link with [[GWR steam rail motors|steam rail motor]] services in the area. Routes linked [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] with [[Cheltenham]]. The Stroud area services were transferred to Western National in 1929. There were also services from Cheltenham to [[Bishops Cleeve]] and [[Winchcombe]], later transferred to [[Bristol Omnibus Company|Bristol Tramways]]. In 1927 some new routes were started from [[Pershore]]. In the following year a long cross-country route from Cheltenham to [[Oxford]] was started to connect Cheltenham to the London trains at Oxford, more direct than the all-rail route to London. The service was transferred to Bristol Tramways in 1932.\n\n===Somerset===\nSome [[steam bus]]es were tried at [[Highbridge and Burnham railway station|Highbridge railway station]] to work a [[Burnham-on-Sea]] to [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]] service during 1905. The following year a number of services were tried that radiated from [[Bridgwater]], but all had been withdrawn by the end of 1911.\n\nServices were run in [[Weston-super-Mare]] along the sea front to the Old Pier and Sand Point, and up the hill to Worlebury. Commencing on 8 July 1928, they continued under GWR operation until 19 July 1931 when they were transferred, along with some routes in [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], to [[Bristol Omnibus Company|Bristol Tramways]], which is now [[First West of England]].\n\n===Other services===\nA route from [[Wolverhampton]] to [[Bridgnorth]] was operated for a short while from 7 November 1904 using steam buses, and was restarted the following year with motor buses. [[Stourbridge]] was linked with [[Bromsgrove]], a town on the [[Midland Railway]], on 13 February 1905.\n\nIn the Weymouth area, services started in 1905 jointly with the [[London and South Western Railway]]. These, the last services operated by the railway, were transferred to the [[Southern National]] company on 1 January 1934.\n\nOther routes could be found at [[Banbury]], [[Frome]], [[Hungerford]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Swindon]], and [[Wantage]].\n\nRoutes were transferred to various local companies, with the railway taking a shareholding to allow it to exert an influence over the bus services, although routes were often transferred over a period of several months following the signing of the agreements on the dates given. Companies involved were the Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Company ([[Midland Red]] \u2013 1 January 1930), [[Oxford Bus Company|City of Oxford Motor Services]] (28 February 1930), [[Thames Valley Traction]] (1 January 1931), although some of those at Slough went to [[London Country Bus Services|London General Country Services]] on 10 April 1932. Routes around Swindon were transferred to [[Bristol Omnibus Company|Bristol Tramways]].\n\n==Services in Wales==\nServices started from [[Wrexham]] on 11 October 1904. Routes radiated from many stations, including [[Aberavon]], [[Abergavenny]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Brecon]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Carmarthen]], [[Corwen]], [[Neath]], [[Newcastle Emlyn]], [[New Quay]], [[Oswestry]], and [[St David's]].\n\nServices in south and west [[Wales]] transferred to the new [[Western Welsh Omnibus Company]] on 1 August 1929, which was half-owned by the railway. Services in the north became \"Western Transport\" from 3 November 1930, which was [[consolidation (business)|amalgamated]] with the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]-backed [[Crosville Motor Services]] on 1 May 1933. This is now [[Arriva Buses Wales]].\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book  | last = Cummings  | first = John  | title = Railway Motor Buses and Bus Services in the British Isles 1902\u20131933, volume 2  | publisher = Oxford Publishing Company  | date = 1980  | location = Headington  | isbn=0-86093-050-5 }}\n* {{cite book  | last = Kelley | first = Philip J | title = Road Vehicles of the Great Western Railway  | publisher = Oxford Publishing  | date = 1973  | location = Headington |  isbn=0-90288-812-9 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gwr.org.uk/noroad1.html GWR Road Vehicles]\n\n{{Defunct British Bus Companies}}\n[[Category:Great Western Railway|Road motor services]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Wales]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in England]]\n[[Category:Bus operators in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Transport in Devon]]\n[[Category:Transport in Buckinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Somerset]]\n[[Category:Transport in Wolverhampton]]\n[[Category:Transport in Shropshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:1903 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1933 disestablishments in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:GWR bus AF84 on Helston service.jpg|right|thumb|200px|AF84 working a service from Helston to the Lizard in 1904]]\nThe '''Great Western Railway road motor services''' operated from 1903 to 1933 by the [[Great Western Railway]], both as a feeder to their train services, and as a cheaper alternative to building new railways in rural areas.

Over centuries in Medieval Spain, Muslims had enslaved Christians, and with the Christian reconquest, the victors enslaved the Moors. Slavery was an institution that was economic in function, but it had strong social dimensions as well. Enslaved persons were outsiders of some kind, by ethnicity, language, or religion or some combination. In Medieval Spain, slaves were considered human and possessed some rights, but were at the bottom of the status hierarchy. There were some Muslim slaves remaining in Christian Spain after 1492, but increasingly enslaved Africans via the Portuguese slave trade became part of Spain's social mosaic. Black slaves in Spain were overwhelmingly domestic servants, and increasingly became prestigious property for elite Spanish households though at a much smaller scale than the Portuguese.  Artisans acquired black slaves and trained them in their trade, increasing the artisans' output.<ref>James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp. 17-19.</ref>\n\nBoth the Spanish and the Portuguese colonized the Atlantic islands off the coast of Africa, where they engaged in [[sugar cane]] production following the model of Mediterranean production. The sugar complex consisted of slave labor for cultivation and processing, with the sugar mill (''ingenio'') and equipment established with investor capital.  When plantation slavery was established in Spanish America and Brazil, they replicated the elements of the complex in the New World on a much larger scale.<ref>Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', pp. 26-28.</ref>\n\nAnother form of forced labor used in the New World with origins in Spain was the [[encomienda]], the award of the labor to Christian victors over Muslims during the reconquest. This institution of forced labor was employed by the Spaniards in the [[Canary Islands]] following their conquest. The institution was much more widespread following the Spanish contact and conquest of indigenous in the New World, but the precedents were set prior to 1492.<ref>Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', pp. 21-22.</ref>\n\n==Indigenous People==\n\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n\nPrior to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], slavery [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|was a common institution among various Pre-Columbian indigenous peoples]]. The Spanish conquest and settlement in the [[New World]] quickly led to large-scale subjugation of indigenous peoples, mainly of the [[Ta\u00edno|Native Caribbean people]], by Columbus on his four voyages. Initially, forced labor represented a means by which the [[conquistadores]] mobilized native labor and met production quotas, with [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|disastrous effects on the population]]. Unlike the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Crown]]'s support for the slave trade, ''[[Catholic monarchs|los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' ({{lang-en|Catholic Monarchs}}) opposed the introduction of slavery in the newly conquered lands on religious grounds.  When Columbus [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#First return|returned with indigenous slaves]], they ordered the survivors to be returned to their homelands. In 1512, after pressure from Dominican friars, the [[Laws of Burgos]] were introduced to protect the rights of the natives in the New World and secure their freedom. The papal bull [[Sublimis Deus|''Sublimus Dei'']] of 1537, to which Spain was committed, also officially banned enslavement of indigenous people, but it was rescinded a year after its promulgation. The other major form of coerced labor in their colonies, the [[encomienda]] system, was also abolished, despite the considerable anger this caused in local criollo elites. It was replaced by the [[repartimiento]] system.<ref name=\"Scarano\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/20715464/ | title=Slavery- Spanish Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, | author=Scarano, Francisco | journal=The Caribbean: A History of the Region and Its Peoples  University of Chicago Press. | year=2013 | pages=21\u201344}}</ref><ref name=\"Paquette\">{{Cite web|title = Slavery in the Americas |url = https://www.academia.edu/20706356/|website = www.academia.edu|author1=Paquette, Robert L.  |author2=Mark M.

These first Africans, who had been enslaved in Europe before crossing the Atlantic, may have spoken Spanish and perhaps were even Christians.  About 17 of them started in the copper mines, and about a hundred were sent to extract gold.  As introduced diseases decimated Caribbean indigenous populations in the first decades of the 1500s, enslaved Blacks from Africa (\"bozales\") gradually replaced their labor, but they also mingled and joined in flights from slavery, creating mixed [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] communities in all the islands where Europeans had established [[chattel slavery]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Maroon Teachers: Teaching the Transatlantic Trade in Enslaved Africans | publisher=Ian Randle Publishers | author=Gift, Sandra Ingrid | year=2008 | location=Kingston, Jamaica | isbn=9789766373405}}</ref> The newly enslaved workers continued to arrive in Spanish colonies as colonials imported them directly from Portuguese traders, who in turn purchased them from African traders on the Atlantic coast.

Its counselors insisted on a source of labor to develop Caribbean plantations.<ref>Sergio Tognetti, \"The Trade in Black African slaves in fifteenth-century Florence,\" a chapter in T. F.

This permission was granted in the form of the [[Asiento]], the official contract for trading in slaves in the vast Spanish territories was a major engine of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Opponents cited the weak [[Christianity|Christian]] faith of the Africans and their penchant for escaping to the mountains. Proponents argued that the rapid decline of the Native American population required a consistent supply of reliable workers.  In addition, the first years of Spanish presence in the Americas were marked by an outbreak of a tropical epidemic influenza that decimated both the native and Spanish populations. It was argued that the population would never be large enough to carry out all the labour needed to assure the economic viability of the Spanish colonies.  In 1501, a first shipment of African-born slaves was sent to the West Indies (Hispaniola). The Spaniards chiefly purchased the slaves from the Portuguese and English traders in Africa.  They did not engage directly in the trade and overall imported fewer slaves to the New World than did the Portuguese, British, or French.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Spanish used enslaved Africans as workers to develop their agriculture and settlements.  They also used them in defense of the colonies. Originally the Crown relied on private initiative and resources to protect colonial shipping and settlements. In some cases, colonists hired out their slaves or donated them for this purpose; in other cases, the Crown bought the slaves. Building forts and defense works relied on slave labor, but most were privately owned.\n\nThe slave populations were extremely low on [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] until the 1760s, when the [[United Kingdom|British]] took [[Havana]], Cuba, in 1762. After that, the British imported more than 10,000 slaves to Havana, a number that would have taken 20 years to import on other islands. They used it as a base to supply the Caribbean and the lower [[Thirteen Colonies]].<ref>Rogozinsky, Jan. ''A Brief History of the Caribbean''. Plume. 1999.</ref> This change is almost directly related to the opening of Spanish slave trade to other powers in the 18th century.  Spain and Great Britain made a contract in 1713 by which the British would provide the slaves. The Spanish outlawed its own slave trade of Africans.\n\nWhile historians have studied the production of sugar on plantations by enslaved workers in nineteenth-century Cuba, they have sometimes overlooked the crucial role of the Spanish state before the 1760s. Cuba ultimately developed two distinct but interrelated sources using enslaved labor, which converged at the end of the eighteenth century. The first of these sectors was urban and was directed in large measure by the needs of the Spanish colonial state, reaching its height in the 1760s. As of 1778, it was reported by [[Thomas Kitchin]] that \"about 52,000 slaves\" were being brought from Africa to the [[West Indies]] by Europeans, with approximately 4,000 being brought by the Spanish.<ref name=Kitchin1>{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R. Baldwin|location=London|page=12|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/}}</ref>\n\nThe second sector, which flourished after 1790, was rural and was directed by private slaveholders/planters involved in the production of export [[Commodity crop|agricultural commodities]], especially sugar. After 1763, the scale and urgency of defense projects led the state to deploy many of its enslaved workers in ways that were to anticipate the intense work regimes on sugar plantations in the nineteenth century. Another important group of workers enslaved by the Spanish colonial state in the late eighteenth century were the king's laborers, who worked on the city's [[fortification]]s.\n\nThe Spanish colonies were late to exploit slave labor in the production of [[sugarcane]], particularly on Cuba.  The Spanish colonies in the Caribbean were among the last to abolish slavery. While the British colonies abolished slavery completely by 1834, Spain abolished slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873 and in Cuba in 1886. On the mainland of Central and South America, Spain ended African slavery in the eighteenth century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Peru was one of the countries that revived the institution for some decades after declaring independence from Spain in the early 19th century.\n\n== Liberation of British and American slaves in Spanish Florida ==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Florida}}\nSince the beginning of the 18th century, [[Spanish Florida]] attracted numerous African slaves who escaped from British slavery in the Thirteen Colonies. Since 1623 the official Spanish policy was that any and all slaves that touched Spanish soil and asked for refuge would be made a free man, alphabetized if he wasn't, helped to establish his own workshop if he had a trade or given a lot of land as his own to cultivate as a farmer. In exchange they would be required to serve for a number of years in the Spanish National Guard and convert to Catholicism. [[Francisco Men\u00e9ndez (creole)|Francisco Men\u00e9ndez]] escaped from South Carolina and traveled to St. Augustine, Florida for freedom.<ref>Riordan, Patrick: \"Finding Freedom in Florida: Native Peoples, African Americans, and Colonists, 1670-1816\", ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' 75(1), 1996, pp. 25-44.</ref>\n\nOnce the slaves reached Florida, the Spanish freed them if they converted to Roman Catholicism. Most settled in a community called [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose]], the first settlement of free slaves in North America.\n\nThe former slaves also found refuge among the [[Creek Indians|Creek]] and [[Seminole]], Native Americans who had established settlements in Florida at the invitation of the Spanish government.{{dubious|date=July 2018}} In 1771, Governor [[John Moultrie (politician)|John Moultrie]] wrote to the English Board of Trade, \"It has been a practice for a good while past, for negroes to run away from their Masters, and get into the Indian towns, from whence it proved very difficult to get them back.\"<ref name=\"miller\"/> When British government officials pressured the Native Americans to return the fugitive slaves, they replied that they had \"merely given hungry people food, and invited the slaveholders to catch the runaways themselves.\"<ref name=\"miller\">Miller, E: \"St. Augustine's British Years,\" ''The Journal of the St. Augustine Historical Society,'' 2001, p. 38. .</ref>\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], slaves from the [[State of Georgia]] and the Low Country escaped to Florida. The U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817\u20131818 campaign by [[Andrew Jackson]] that became known as the [[First Seminole War]]. The United States afterwards effectively controlled [[East Florida]]. According to Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]], the US had to take action there because Florida had become \"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\".<ref>Alexander Deconde, ''A History of American Foreign Policy'' (1963) p. 127</ref> Spain requested British intervention, but London declined to assist Spain in the negotiations. Some of President [[James Monroe]]'s cabinet demanded Jackson's immediate dismissal, but Adams realized that it put the U.S. in a favorable diplomatic position. Adams negotiated very favorable terms.<ref>Weeks (2002)</ref>\n\nAs Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons, the Crown decided to cede the territory to the United States. It accomplished this through the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] in 1819, effective 1821.\n\n==Ending of slavery==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nSupport for [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionism]] rose in Great Britain. Slavery was abolished under the [[French Revolution]], for the French Caribbean colonies, (the slavery was abolished in European part of France in 1315 by Louis X) but was restored under [[Napoleon I]]. Slaves in Saint-Domingue established independence, founding the republic of Haiti in 1804.\n\nLater slave revolts were arguably part of the upsurge of liberal and democratic values centered on individual rights and liberties which came in the aftermath of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution in Europe. As emancipation became more of a concrete reality, the slaves' concept of freedom changed. No longer did they seek to overthrow the whites and re-establish carbon-copy African societies as they had done during the earlier rebellions; the vast majority of slaves were  creole, native born where they lived, and envisaged their freedom within the established framework of the existing society.\n[[File:Indemnity slave-bond.tif|thumb|upright|On March 22, 1873, the Spain abolished slavery in [[Puerto Rico]]. The owners were compensated.]]\nThe [[Spanish American wars of independence]] emancipated most of the overseas territories of Spain; in Central and South America, various nations emerged from these wars. The wars were  influenced by the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and economic affairs, which also led to the reduction and ending of feudalism. It was not a unified process. Some countries, including Peru and Ecuador, reintroduced slavery for some time after achieving independence.\n\nIn the treaty of 1814, the king of Spain promised to consider means for abolishing the slave trade. In the treaty of September 23, 1817, with Great Britain, the Spanish Crown said that \"having never lost sight of a matter so interesting to him and being desirous of hastening the moment of its attainment, he has determined to co-operate with His Britannic Majesty in adopting the cause of humanity.\" The king bound himself \"that the slave trade will be abolished in all the dominions of Spain, May 30, 1820, and that after that date it shall not be lawful for any subject of the crown of Spain to buy slaves or carry on the slave trade upon any part of the coast of Africa.\" The date of final suppression was October 30. The subjects of the king of Spain were forbidden to carry slaves for any one outside the Spanish dominions, or to use the flag to cover such dealings.\u00b3\n\nThe [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]] (1813) of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] declared the [[freedom of wombs]]. It did not end slavery completely, but emancipated the children of slaves. Many slaves gained emancipation by joining the armies, either against royalists during the War of Independence, or during the later Civil Wars. For example, the [[Argentine Confederation]] ended slavery definitely with the sanction of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Atlantic slave trade]]\n*[[European colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean]]\n*[[Slavery in Latin America]]\n*[[Slavery in Spain]]\n*[[Peon]]\n*[[Race and ethnicity in Latin America]]\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Primary sources===\n\n*Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9 de, ''The Devastation of the Indies'', Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore & London, 1992.\n*Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9 de, ''History of the Indies'', translated by Andr\u00e9e M.

Meanwhile, slavery was gradually replaced with similarly barbarous forms of labor, like [[peon]]age and the harsh use of Asian migrant workers.

With the rise of Christianity, the status of slaves was not altered, but slaves were to be converted to Christianity. Christians were in theory banned from enslaving fellow Christians, but the practice persisted. With the rise of Islam, and the conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula in the eighth century, slavery declined in remaining Iberian Christian kingdoms. Muslims were resistant to conversion to Christianity, and they did not enslave fellow believers. Latin Christianity gradually diminished enslavement of fellow Christians.<ref>Blackburn, ''The Making of New World Slavery'', pp.34-44.</ref> As Christian Spain sought to retake territory lost to Muslims, the [[reconquista]] had implications for their understanding of slavery. Conquered Muslims were enslaved with the justification conversion and acculturation, but Muslim captives were often offered back to their families and communities for cash payments (''rescate''). The thirteenth-century code of law, the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso \"the learned\"]] (1252\u20131284) specified who could be enslaved: those who were captured in just war; offspring of an enslaved mother; those who voluntarily sold themselves into slavery, and specified slaves' good treatment by their masters. At the time it was generally domestic slavery and was a temporary condition of members of outgroups.<ref>Blackburn, ''The Making of New World Slavery'', pp. 50-51.</ref> As well as the formal parameters for slavery, the ''Siete Partidas'' also makes a value judgment, stating that it \"was the basest and most wretched condition into which anyone could fall because man, who is the most free  noble of all God's creatures, becomes thereby in the power of another, who can do with him what he wishes as with any property, whether living or dead.\"<ref>quoted in Blackburn,''The Making of New World Slavery'', p. 51.</ref>\n[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|400px|thumb|right|Lines dividing the non-Christian world between Castile and Portugal: the 1494 Tordesillas meridian (purple) and the 1529 Zaragoza antimeridian (green)]]\nAs the Spanish (Castilians) and Portuguese expanded overseas, they conquered and occupied Atlantic islands off the north coast of Africa, including the [[Canary Islands]] as well as [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] and [[Madeira]] where they introduced plantation sugar cultivation.  They considered the indigenous populations there more animal than human, supposedly justifying their enslavement.  The Canary Islands came under Castilian control, and by the early sixteenth century the indigenous population had largely been decimated and African slave labor replaced indigenous. Multiple West African states were participants in slave raiding and trading, and the slaves the Castilians purchased were considered legitimate slaves. Slave-trading African states accepted a variety of European goods, including firearms, horses, and other desirable goods in exchange for slaves.<ref>Blackburn, ''The Making of New World Slavery'', pp. 62-63, 81-82.</ref>\n\nBoth the Spanish and the Portuguese colonized the Atlantic islands off the coast of Africa, where they engaged in [[sugar cane]] production following the model of Mediterranean production. The sugar complex consisted of slave labor for cultivation and processing, with the sugar mill (''ingenio'') and equipment established with significant investor capital.  When plantation slavery was established in Spanish America and Brazil, they replicated the elements of the complex in the New World on a much larger scale.<ref>Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', pp. 26-28.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese exploration of the African coast and the division of overseas territories via the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] meant that the African slave trade was held by the Portuguese. However, demand for African slaves as the Spanish established themselves in the Caribbean meant that became part of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s social mosaic. Black slaves in Spain were overwhelmingly domestic servants, and increasingly became prestigious property for elite Spanish households though at a much smaller scale than the Portuguese.  Artisans acquired black slaves and trained them in their trade, increasing the artisans' output.<ref>Lockhart, James and Stuart B. Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp. 17-19.</ref>\n\nAnother form of forced labor used in the New World with origins in Spain was the [[encomienda]], on the model of the award of the labor to Christian victors over Muslims during the [[reconquista]]. This institution of forced labor was initially employed by the Spaniards in the [[Canary Islands]] following their conquest, but the [[Guanches|Guanche]] (Canarian) population precipitously declined. The institution as an institution was much more widespread following the Spanish contact and conquests in Mexico and Peru, but the precedents were set prior to 1492.<ref>Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', pp. 21-22.</ref>\n\n==Prohibition of forced labor of Indigenous Peoples==\n{{See also|Spanish colonization of the Americas#Spanish Law and indigenous peoples}}\n[[Image:Collared.jpg|thumb|250px|An Aztec slave.]]\n[[File:Xochipilla.jpg|thumb|250px|Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza and Tlaxcalan Indians battle with the Caxcanes in the Mixt\u00f3n War]]\nPrior to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], slavery [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|was a common institution among some Pre-Columbian indigenous peoples]], particularly the [[Aztec slavery|Aztecs]]. The Spanish conquest and settlement in the [[New World]] quickly led to large-scale subjugation of indigenous peoples, mainly of the [[Ta\u00edno|Native Caribbean people]], by Columbus on his four voyages. Initially, forced labor represented a means by which the [[conquistadores]] mobilized native labor, with [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|disastrous effects on the population]]. Unlike the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Crown]]'s support for the slave trade in Africa, ''[[Catholic monarchs|los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]]'' ({{lang-en|Catholic Monarchs}}) opposed the enslavement of the native peoples in the newly conquered lands on religious grounds.  When Columbus [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Slavery,_settlers,_and_tribute|returned with indigenous slaves]], they ordered the survivors to be returned to their homelands. In 1512, after pressure from Dominican friars, the [[Laws of Burgos]] were introduced to protect the rights of the natives in the New World and secure their freedom. The papal bull [[Sublimis Deus|''Sublimus Dei'']] of 1537, to which Spain was committed, also officially banned enslavement of indigenous peoples, but it was rescinded a year after its promulgation. \n\nThe other major form of coerced labor in their colonies, the [[encomienda]] system, was also abolished, despite the considerable anger this caused in the conquistador group who had expected to hold their grants in perpetuity.  It was replaced by the [[repartimiento]] system.<ref name=\"Scarano\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/20715464 | title=Slavery- Spanish Hispaniola and Puerto Rico | author=Scarano, Francisco | journal=The Caribbean: A History of the Region and Its Peoples University of Chicago Press. | year=2013 | pages=21\u201344}}</ref><ref name=\"Paquette\">{{Cite web|title = Slavery in the Americas |url = https://www.academia.edu/20706356|website = www.academia.edu|author1=Paquette, Robert L.  |author2=Mark M.

Spanish colonists purchased them directly from Portuguese traders, who in turn purchased them from African traders on the Atlantic coast. With the increased dependency on enslaved Africans and with the Spanish crown opposed to enslavement of indigenous, except in the case of rebellion, slavery became associated with race and racial hierarchy, with Europeans hardening  their concepts of racial ideologies. These were buttressed by prior ideologies of differentiation as that of the [[limpieza de sangre]] (en: purity of blood), which in Spain referred to individuals without the perceived taint of Jewish or Muslim ancestry.<ref name=\"Asante\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/296509575 | title=The Ideology of Racial Hierarchy and the Construction of the European Slave Trade | author=Asante, Molefi Kete | journal=Black Renaissance | year=2001 | volume=3 | issue=3 | pages=133\u2013146}}</ref> However, in Spanish America, purity of blood came to mean a person free of any African ancestry.<ref>Mart\u00ednez, Mar\u00eda Elena. \"The Black Blood of New Spain: Limpieza De Sangre, Racial Violence, and Gendered Power in Early Colonial Mexico\".

The crown issued licenses [[asiento]]s, to merchants to specifically trade slaves, regulating the trade.  During the 16th century, the Spanish colonies were the most important customers of the Atlantic slave trade, claiming several thousands in sales, but the Dutch, French and British soon dwarfed these numbers when their demand for enslaved workers began to drive the slave market to unprecedented levels.<ref name=\"Spanish Hispaniola\">{{cite journal| url=https://www.academia.edu/20715464 | title=Spanish Hispaniola and Puerto Rico| author=Sacarano, Francisco | journal=The Oxford Handbook of Slavery in the Americas (Edited by Paquette, Robert L., and Mark M.

He learned several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages in the process. He went on to serve as a well-respected guide.  Later, while leading an expedition in what is now [[New Mexico]] in search of [[Quivira and C\u00edbola|the Seven Cities of Gold]], he was killed in a dispute with the [[Zuni people|Zu\u00f1i]] local people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Black slavery in the late colonial period==\nBlack slave populations were extremely low on [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] until the 1760s, when the [[United Kingdom|British]] took [[Havana]], Cuba, in 1762. After that, the British imported more than 10,000 African slaves to Havana, a number that would have taken 20 years to import on other islands. They used it as a base to supply the Caribbean and the lower [[Thirteen Colonies]].<ref>Rogozinsky, Jan. ''A Brief History of the Caribbean''. Plume. 1999.</ref> This change is almost directly related to the opening of Spanish slave trade to other powers in the 18th century.  Spain and Great Britain made a contract in 1713 by which the British would provide the slaves. The Spanish outlawed its own slave trade of Africans.\n\nWhile historians have studied the production of sugar on plantations by enslaved workers in nineteenth-century Cuba, they have sometimes overlooked the crucial role of the Spanish state before the 1760s. Cuba ultimately developed two distinct but interrelated sources using enslaved labor, which converged at the end of the eighteenth century. The first of these sectors was urban and was directed in large measure by the needs of the Spanish colonial state, reaching its height in the 1760s. As of 1778, it was reported by [[Thomas Kitchin]] that \"about 52,000 slaves\" were being brought from Africa to the [[West Indies]] by Europeans, with approximately 4,000 being brought by the Spanish.<ref name=Kitchin1>{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R. Baldwin|location=London|page=12|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/}}</ref>\n\nThe second sector, which flourished after 1790, was rural and was directed by private slaveholders/planters involved in the production of export [[Commodity crop|agricultural commodities]], especially sugar. After 1763, the scale and urgency of defense projects led the state to deploy many of its enslaved workers in ways that were to anticipate the intense work regimes on sugar plantations in the nineteenth century. Another important group of workers enslaved by the Spanish colonial state in the late eighteenth century were the king's laborers, who worked on the city's [[fortification]]s.\n\nThe Spanish colonies were late to exploit slave labor in the production of [[sugarcane]], particularly on Cuba.  The Spanish colonies in the Caribbean were among the last to abolish slavery. While the British colonies abolished slavery completely by 1834, Spain abolished slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873 and in Cuba in 1886. On the mainland of Central and South America, Spain ended African slavery in the eighteenth century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Peru was one of the countries that revived the institution for some decades after declaring independence from Spain in the early 19th century.\n\n== British and American slaves in Spanish Florida ==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Florida}}\nSince the beginning of the 18th century, [[Spanish Florida]] attracted numerous African slaves who escaped from British slavery in the Thirteen Colonies. Since 1623 the official Spanish policy had been that all slaves who touched Spanish soil and asked for refuge could become free Spanish citizens, and would be assisted in establishing their own workshops if they had a trade or given a grant of land to cultivate if they were farmers. In exchange they would be required to convert to Catholicism and serve for a number of years in the Spanish militia. Most were settled in a community called [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose]], the first settlement of free African's in North America.

The U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817\u20131818 campaign by [[Andrew Jackson]] that became known as the [[First Seminole War]]. The United States afterwards effectively controlled [[East Florida]]. According to Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]], the US had to take action there because Florida had become \"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\".<ref>Alexander Deconde, ''A History of American Foreign Policy'' (1963) p. 127</ref> Spain requested British intervention, but London declined to assist Spain in the negotiations. Some of President [[James Monroe]]'s cabinet demanded Jackson's immediate dismissal, but Adams realized that it put the U.S. in a favorable diplomatic position. Adams negotiated very favorable terms.<ref>Weeks (2002)</ref>\n\nAs Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons, the Crown decided to cede the territory to the United States. It accomplished this through the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] in 1819, effective 1821.\n\n==Ending of slavery==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nSupport for [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionism]] rose in Great Britain. Slavery was abolished under the [[French Revolution]], for the French Caribbean colonies, (the slavery was abolished in European part of France in 1315 by Louis X) but was restored under [[Napoleon I]]. Slaves in Saint-Domingue established independence, founding the republic of Haiti in 1804.\n\nLater slave revolts were arguably part of the upsurge of liberal and democratic values centered on individual rights and liberties which came in the aftermath of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution in Europe. As emancipation became more of a concrete reality, the slaves' concept of freedom changed. No longer did they seek to overthrow the whites and re-establish carbon-copy African societies as they had done during the earlier rebellions; the vast majority of slaves were  creole, native born where they lived, and envisaged their freedom within the established framework of the existing society.\n[[File:Indemnity slave-bond.tif|thumb|upright|On March 22, 1873, the Spain abolished slavery in [[Puerto Rico]]. The owners were compensated.]]\nThe [[Spanish American wars of independence]] emancipated most of the overseas territories of Spain; in Central and South America, various nations emerged from these wars. The wars were  influenced by the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and economic affairs, which also led to the reduction and ending of feudalism. It was not a unified process. Some countries, including Peru and Ecuador, reintroduced slavery for some time after achieving independence.\n\nIn the treaty of 1814, the king of Spain promised to consider means for abolishing the slave trade. In the treaty of September 23, 1817, with Great Britain, the Spanish Crown said that \"having never lost sight of a matter so interesting to him and being desirous of hastening the moment of its attainment, he has determined to co-operate with His Britannic Majesty in adopting the cause of humanity.\" The king bound himself \"that the slave trade will be abolished in all the dominions of Spain, May 30, 1820, and that after that date it shall not be lawful for any subject of the crown of Spain to buy slaves or carry on the slave trade upon any part of the coast of Africa.\" The date of final suppression was October 30. The subjects of the king of Spain were forbidden to carry slaves for any one outside the Spanish dominions, or to use the flag to cover such dealings.\u00b3\n\nThe [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]] (1813) of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] declared the [[freedom of wombs]]. It did not end slavery completely, but emancipated the children of slaves. Many slaves gained emancipation by joining the armies, either against royalists during the War of Independence, or during the later Civil Wars. For example, the [[Argentine Confederation]] ended slavery definitely with the sanction of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Afro-Mexicans]]\n*[[Atlantic slave trade]]\n*[[European colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean]]\n*[[Slavery in Latin America]]\n*[[Slavery in Spain]]\n*[[Peon]]\n*[[Race and ethnicity in Latin America]]\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Primary sources===\n\n*Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9 de, ''The Devastation of the Indies'', Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore & London, 1992.\n*Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9 de, ''History of the Indies'', translated by Andr\u00e9e M.

An abnormal reflex commonly called [[Plantar reflex|Babinski's sign]] also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations). However, twitching is more of a side effect than a diagnostic symptom; it either occurs after or accompanies weakness and atrophy.<ref name=NINDS2014/>\n\n=== Progression ===\nAlthough the initial symptoms and rate of progression vary from person to person, the disease eventually spreads to unaffected regions and the affected regions become more affected.

In about 97% of people with ALS, the main component of the inclusion bodies is TDP-43 protein;<ref name=Nature2017/> however, in those with ''SOD1'' or ''FUS'' mutations, the main component is SOD1 protein or FUS protein, respectively.<ref name=\"Cold Spring Harbor 2017\"/> The [[gross pathology]] of ALS, which are features of the disease that can be seen with the naked eye, include skeletal muscle atrophy, motor cortex atrophy, sclerosis of the [[corticospinal tract|corticospinal]] and [[corticobulbar tract]]s, thinning of the [[hypoglossal nerve]]s (which control the tongue), and thinning of the anterior roots of the spinal cord.<ref name=Nature2017/> Besides for the death of motor neurons, two other characteristics common to most ALS variants are focal initial pathology, meaning that symptoms start in a single spinal cord region, and progressive continuous spread, meaning that symptoms spread to additional regions over time. [[Prion]]-like propagation of misfolded proteins from cell to cell may explain why ALS starts in one area and spreads to others.<ref name=\"Cold Spring Harbor 2017\"/>\n\n===Biochemistry===\n[[File:ALS Disease Pathology and Proposed Disease Mechanisms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|This figure shows ten proposed disease mechanisms for ALS and the genes associated with them.<ref name=\"Modelling ALS\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Philip Van Damme P, Robberecht W, Van Den Bosch L  | title = Modelling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: progress and possibilities | journal = Disease Models and Mechanisms | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 537\u201349 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28468939 | pmc = 5451175 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.029058 }}</ref>]]\nIt is still not fully understood why neurons die in ALS, but this [[neurodegeneration]] is thought to involve many different cellular and molecular processes.<ref name=Lancet2017/> The genes known to be involved in ALS can be grouped into three general categories based on their normal function: protein degradation, the [[cytoskeleton]], and RNA processing. Mutant SOD1 protein forms intracellular aggregations that inhibit protein degradation. Cytoplasmic aggregations of [[wild-type]] (normal) SOD1 protein are common in sporadic ALS.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> It is thought that misfolded mutant SOD1 can cause misfolding and aggregation of wild-type SOD1 in neighboring neurons in a prion-like manner.<ref name=Nature2017/> Other protein degradation genes that can cause ALS when mutated include ''[[Valosin-containing protein|VCP]]'', ''[[Optineurin|OPTN]]'', ''TBK1'', and ''SQSTM1''. Three genes implicated in ALS that are important for maintaining the cytoskeleton<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> and for axonal transport<ref name=Nature2017/> include ''[[DCTN1]]'', ''[[PFN1]]'', and ''[[TUBA4A]]''.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\nThere are a number of ALS genes that encode for RNA-binding proteins. The first to be discovered was TDP-43 protein,<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> a nuclear protein that aggregates in the cytoplasm of motor neurons in almost all cases of ALS; however, mutations in ''TARDBP'', the gene that codes for TDP-43, are a rare cause of ALS.<ref name=Nature2017/> ''FUS'' codes for FUS, another RNA-binding protein with a similar function to TDP-43, which can cause ALS when mutated.<ref name=Neuroscience2014/> It is thought that mutations in ''TARDBP'' and ''FUS'' increase the binding affinity of the low-complexity domain, causing their respective proteins to aggregate in the cytoplasm. Once these mutant RNA-binding proteins are misfolded and aggregated, they may be able to misfold normal protein both within and between cells in a prion-like manner.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> This also leads to decreased levels of RNA-binding protein in the nucleus, which may mean that their target RNA transcripts do not undergo the normal processing. Other RNA metabolism genes associated with ALS include ''[[angiogenin|ANG]]'', ''[[SETX]]'', and ''[[MATR3]]''.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n''C9orf72'' is the most commonly mutated gene in ALS and causes motor neuron death through a number of mechanisms.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> The pathogenic mutation is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (a series of six nucleotides repeated over and over);<ref name=\"Trends in Genetics 2018\"/> people with 30 repeats are normal, while people with hundreds or thousands of repeats can have familial ALS, frontotemporal dementia, or sometimes sporadic ALS. The three mechanisms of disease associated with these ''C9orf72'' repeats are deposition of RNA transcripts in the nucleus, translation of the RNA into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins in the cytoplasm, and decreased levels of the normal C9orf72 protein.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\n[[Excitotoxicity]], or nerve cell death caused by high levels of intracellular calcium due to excessive stimulation by the excitatory neurotransmitter [[glutamate]], is a mechanism thought to be common to all forms of ALS. Motor neurons are more sensitive to excitotoxicity than other types of neurons because they have a lower calcium-buffering capacity and a type of glutamate receptor (the [[AMPA receptor]]) that is more permeable to calcium. In ALS, there are decreased levels of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ([[EAAT2]]), which is the main transporter that removes glutamate from the synapse; this leads to increased synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity. Riluzole, a drug that modestly prolongs survival in ALS, inhibits glutamate release from pre-synaptic neurons; however, it is unclear if this mechanism is responsible for its therapeutic effect.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:ALS cross.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MRI (axial [[Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery|FLAIR]]) demonstrates increased [[Spin-spin relaxation|''T<sub>2</sub>'']] signal within the [[Internal capsule#Posterior limb|posterior part of the internal capsule]], consistent with the diagnosis of ALS.]]\nNo test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the [[physician]] observes in the person and a series of tests to rule out other diseases.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Physicians obtain the person's full [[medical history]] and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, [[hyperreflexia]], and spasticity are worsening.<ref name=NINDS2014/> A number of biomarkers are being studied for the condition, but so far are not in general medical use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Z, Henderson RD, David M, McCombe PA | title = Neurofilaments as Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = e0164625 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27732645 | pmc = 5061412 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0164625 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1164625X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vu LT, Bowser R | title = Fluid-Based Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 119\u2013134 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27933485 | pmc = 5233638 | doi = 10.1007/s13311-016-0503-x }}</ref>\n\n===Diagnostic criteria===\nThe diagnosis of ALS is based on the El Escorial Revised criteria and the Awaji criteria.<ref name=Nature2017/> The original El Escorial criteria had four levels of diagnostic certainty, based on how many of the four spinal cord regions were involved: bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. Definite ALS was defined as upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in three spinal cord regions, probable ALS as UMN and LMN signs in two regions, possible ALS as UMN and LMN signs in only one region, and suspected ALS as LMN signs only. The El Escorial Revised criteria, also known as the Airlie House criteria, dropped the \"suspected ALS\" category and added a \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category. The Awaji criteria give abnormal EMG tests the same weight as clinical signs of LMN dysfunction in making the diagnosis of ALS,<ref name=Classification2016/> thus making the \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category unnecessary.

If the legs are affected first, people may experience awkwardness, tripping, or stumbling when walking or running; this is often marked by walking with a \"[[Foot drop|dropped foot]]\" that drags gently on the ground. If the arms are affected first, they may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity, such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock.<ref name=NHSsymptoms/>\n\nIn bulbar-onset ALS, the first symptoms are difficulty speaking or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. There may be difficulty with swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of people experience \"respiratory-onset\" ALS, where the [[intercostal muscle]]s that support breathing are affected first.<ref name=Lancet2011/>\n\nOver time, people experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and speaking or forming words ([[dysarthria]]). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles ([[spasticity]]) and exaggerated reflexes ([[hyperreflexia]]), including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called [[Plantar reflex|Babinski's sign]] also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations). However, twitching is more of a side effect than a diagnostic symptom; it either occurs after or accompanies weakness and atrophy.<ref name=NINDS2014/>\n\n=== Progression ===\nAlthough the initial symptoms and rate of progression vary from person to person, the disease eventually spreads to unaffected regions and the affected regions become more affected.

The first to be discovered was TDP-43 protein,<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> a nuclear protein that aggregates in the cytoplasm of motor neurons in almost all cases of ALS; however, mutations in ''TARDBP'', the gene that codes for TDP-43, are a rare cause of ALS.<ref name=Nature2017/> ''FUS'' codes for FUS, another RNA-binding protein with a similar function to TDP-43, which can cause ALS when mutated.<ref name=Neuroscience2014/> It is thought that mutations in ''TARDBP'' and ''FUS'' increase the binding affinity of the low-complexity domain, causing their respective proteins to aggregate in the cytoplasm. Once these mutant RNA-binding proteins are misfolded and aggregated, they may be able to misfold normal protein both within and between cells in a prion-like manner.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> This also leads to decreased levels of RNA-binding protein in the nucleus, which may mean that their target RNA transcripts do not undergo the normal processing. Other RNA metabolism genes associated with ALS include ''[[angiogenin|ANG]]'', ''[[SETX]]'', and ''[[MATR3]]''.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n''C9orf72'' is the most commonly mutated gene in ALS and causes motor neuron death through a number of mechanisms.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> The pathogenic mutation is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (a series of six nucleotides repeated over and over);<ref name=\"Trends in Genetics 2018\"/> people with 30 repeats are normal, while people with hundreds or thousands of repeats can have familial ALS, frontotemporal dementia, or sometimes sporadic ALS. The three mechanisms of disease associated with these ''C9orf72'' repeats are deposition of RNA transcripts in the nucleus, translation of the RNA into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins in the cytoplasm, and decreased levels of the normal C9orf72 protein.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\n[[Excitotoxicity]], or nerve cell death caused by high levels of intracellular calcium due to excessive stimulation by the excitatory neurotransmitter [[glutamate]], is a mechanism thought to be common to all forms of ALS. Motor neurons are more sensitive to excitotoxicity than other types of neurons because they have a lower calcium-buffering capacity and a type of glutamate receptor (the [[AMPA receptor]]) that is more permeable to calcium. In ALS, there are decreased levels of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ([[EAAT2]]), which is the main transporter that removes glutamate from the synapse; this leads to increased synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity. Riluzole, a drug that modestly prolongs survival in ALS, inhibits glutamate release from pre-synaptic neurons; however, it is unclear if this mechanism is responsible for its therapeutic effect.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:ALS cross.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MRI (axial [[Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery|FLAIR]]) demonstrates increased [[Spin-spin relaxation|''T<sub>2</sub>'']] signal within the [[Internal capsule#Posterior limb|posterior part of the internal capsule]], consistent with the diagnosis of ALS.]]\nNo test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the [[physician]] observes in the person and a series of tests to rule out other diseases.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Physicians obtain the person's full [[medical history]] and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, [[hyperreflexia]], and spasticity are worsening.<ref name=NINDS2014/> A number of biomarkers are being studied for the condition, but so far are not in general medical use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Z, Henderson RD, David M, McCombe PA | title = Neurofilaments as Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = e0164625 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27732645 | pmc = 5061412 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0164625 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1164625X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vu LT, Bowser R | title = Fluid-Based Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 119\u2013134 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27933485 | pmc = 5233638 | doi = 10.1007/s13311-016-0503-x }}</ref>\n\n===Diagnostic criteria===\nThe diagnosis of ALS is based on the El Escorial Revised criteria and the Awaji criteria.<ref name=Nature2017/> The original El Escorial criteria had four levels of diagnostic certainty, based on how many of the four spinal cord regions were involved: bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar.

The El Escorial Revised criteria, also known as the Airlie House criteria, dropped the \"suspected ALS\" category and added a \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category. The Awaji criteria give abnormal EMG tests the same weight as clinical signs of LMN dysfunction in making the diagnosis of ALS,<ref name=Classification2016/> thus making the \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category unnecessary.

These trials in humans went ahead on the basis of positive results in ''SOD1'' transgenic mice, which are not a good animal model for sporadic ALS. Additionally, in most preclinical studies the ''SOD1'' mice were given the drug during the presymptomatic stage; this makes the results less likely to apply to people with ALS, who begin treatment well after their symptoms begin. Positive results in small phase II studies in humans could also be misleading and lead to failure in phase III trials.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\nWhile sailing yachts continued to exist, the development of reliable power plants created a new category of pleasure craft. The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

In junior years, the curriculum is a broad one where history, geography, and science are studied alongside subjects that have already been studied at primary schools. In senior years, this becomes more selective and students have a choice over what and how much is to be studied. Almost all schools but [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]] and its feeder junior secondary college have both sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itseducation.asia/education-system.htm|title=The Hong Kong Education System and school system explained|access-date=7 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903115913/http://www.itseducation.asia/education-system.htm|archive-date=3 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Further education===\n\nThe commerce stream in secondary schools is considered [[Vocational Education|vocational]]. Students in the Commerce stream would usually enter the workplace to gain practical work experience by this point. Further education pursuits in the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education or universities abroad are common. The [[Manpower Development Committee]] (MDC) advises the government on coordination, regulation, and promotion of the sector. Also, the [[Vocational Training Council]] (VTC) ensures the level of standard is met through the ''\"Apprentice Ordinance\"''. The VTC also operates three skills-centres for people with disabilities. secondary schools in Hong Kong are going to be cut down to only two years due to the switch in the government.\n\n===Alternative education options===\n\nInternational institutions provide both primary and secondary education in Hong Kong. International institutions like schools within the [[English Schools Foundation]], [[Li Po Chun United World College]], [[Hong Kong International School]], [[American International School Hong Kong]], [[Chinese International School]], [http://www.vsa.edu.hk Victoria Shanghai Academy] [[German Swiss International School]], [[Canadian International School of Hong Kong|Canadian International School]], [[Hong Kong Japanese School]], [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais International Victor Segalen|French International School]], [[Yew Chung International School]], [[Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School]], [[Singapore International School]], and [[Harrow International School Hong Kong]] teach with English as the primary language, with some sections bilingual in German, French and Chinese. International school students rarely take Hong Kong public exams. British students take [[GCSE]], [[IGCSE]], and A-levels. US students take [[Advanced Placement|AP]]s. Increasingly, international schools follow the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IBDP) program and enter universities through non-[[JUPAS]] direct entry. International students apply on a per-school basis, whereas Hong Kong local students submit 1 application for multiple local universities as a JUPAS applicant.\n\n==Tertiary and Higher education==\n\n[[File:The University of Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|[[University of Hong Kong]].]]\n{{Main|Higher education in Hong Kong}}\n\nHigher education remains exclusive in Hong Kong.

The concept was not common several decades ago. The [[Education and Manpower Bureau|EMB]] has commissioned two non-profit school operators to provide evening courses. The operators have fee remission schemes to help adult learners in need of financial assistance. Adult education courses also provide Vocational Training Council through universities and private institutions. The [[Open University of Hong Kong]] is one establishment for mature students. Several secondary schools operate adult education sessions, the first being [[Cheung Sha Wan Catholic Secondary School]], while [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]] offers [[associate degree]] and joint-degree programmes.\n\n==Education for immigrant and non-Cantonese-speaking children==\n\nThe Education Bureau provides education services for immigrant children from [[Mainland China]] and other countries, as well as non-Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong children. Free \"Induction Programmes\" of up to 60 hours have been offered to NAC by non-government organisations. The EMB also provides a 6-month full-time \"Initiation Programme\" incorporating both academic and non-academic support services, for NAC before they are formally placed into mainstream schools.

In 2013 there were 556 white students of any background in Hong Kong government schools. Historically non-local students from other Asian countries attended government schools while white students attended private schools instead. In 2018 Angie Chan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that increasing numbers of white students were enrolling in Cantonese medium government schools. This was due to increasing tuitions from international schools which received influxes of wealthy Mainland Chinese and desires from parents for white students to learn Cantonese.<ref name=ChanWhiteStudents>{{cite web|author=Chan, Angie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/world/asia/hong-kong-schools-.html|title=The New Thing in Hong Kong\u2019s Public Schools: White Students|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2018-08-22|accessdate=2020-01-18}}<!--Chinese versions: TRAD: https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20180827/hong-kong-schools-/zh-hant/ // SIMP: https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20180827/hong-kong-schools-/ --></ref>\n\n==International education==\n\nAs of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=International School Consultancy Group > Home|access-date=19 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130003317/http://www.iscresearch.com/|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> listed Hong Kong as having 175 international schools.<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|title=International School Consultancy Group > Information > ISC News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country\u2019s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\"<ref name=\"iscresearch.com\"/> This definition is used by publications including ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|date=17 December 2014|journal=The Economist|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215730/http://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> There are top-rated exempted courses where courses offered overseas are collaborated with local institutions in Hong Kong to broaden the scope of [[Tertiary Education]] in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/tc/edu-system/postsecondary/non-local-higher-professional-edu/course/exempted-course.html|script-title=zh:\u7372\u8c41\u514d\u8ab2\u7a0b\u540d\u55ae|author=|date=|website=www.edb.gov.hk|accessdate=21 April 2018|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426175957/http://www.edb.gov.hk/tc/edu-system/postsecondary/non-local-higher-professional-edu/course/exempted-course.html|archive-date=26 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[MIT]] has an innovation node in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hkinnovationnode.mit.edu/news/|title=News - MIT Hong Kong Innovation Node|author=|date=|website=MIT Hong Kong Innovation Node|accessdate=21 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923210952/http://hkinnovationnode.mit.edu/news/|archive-date=23 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the international day school, [[Japanese in Hong Kong|Hong Kong's Japanese population]] is served by a [[hoshuko|weekend education programme]], the {{Nihongo|Hong Kong Japanese Supplementary School|\u9999\u6e2f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821|Honkon Nihonjin Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d|extra=HKJSS}}.<ref>\"[http://www.hkjss.hk/ Home] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503215234/http://www.hkjss.hk/ |date=3 May 2015 }}.\" Hong Kong Japanese Supplementary School.

The two sessions are usually treated as separate school entities with two different headmasters. To make up for the time of shortened half days, students are sometimes required to attend alternate Saturdays. Most primary schools are gradually moving to full school day systems as government policy aims to phase out half-day schooling over time as resource permits.\n\nDue to the drop in [[birth rate]] in recent years, many primary schools were forced to cut classes, cut teachers and even close down. There have been debates that one should seize the opportunity to promote small class teaching.  Doing so could mitigate the pressure of teachers, class and school reductions, on top of improving ratio of students to teachers.\n\n==Discipline==\n\nGood behaviour has always been emphasised in Hong Kong, to the point that it is sometimes said to hinder pupils' development. Misbehavior is recorded and shown on school reports. The Education Bureau (EDB) provides the 'Guidelines for Student Disciplines' to schools to as guidance in creating a disciplined education environment. It outlines the principles and policies regarding student discipline, the organisational structure of a school discipline team, the roles and responsibilities of the discipline master and mistress, and discipline strategies illustrated with case studies.<ref>{{cite web|first1=|title=Student Guidance and Discipline Services|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/student-parents/student-guidance-discipline-services/overview/index.html|website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719191521/http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/student-parents/student-guidance-discipline-services/overview/index.html|archive-date=19 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{see also|Hong Kong Kids phenomenon|Monster parents}}\n\n===Spoon feeding===\n\nEducation in Hong Kong has often been described as 'spoon fed'. [[Cram schools in Hong Kong]] have also become a popular standard in parallel to regular education. Teachers focus on helping students getting high scores in the major exams and heavily rely on textbook knowledge rather than exchanging ideas and essence of the subjects.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chong, Chan|first1=Dennis, Joyee|title=Students 'spoon-fed'|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1006323/students-spoon-fed|accessdate=4 August 2015|agency=South China Morning Post|date=9 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095939/http://www.scmp.com/article/1006323/students-spoon-fed|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Education reform===\n{{OR-section|date=June 2018}}\nWith the advent of education reform there is a greater emphasis on group projects, open-ended assignments on top of traditional homework. The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately two hours of schoolwork nightly. Along with [[extra-curricular activities]], Hong Kong's education has become synonymous for leaning towards quantity. As early as March 1987, education advisory inspectors became concerned with the excessive amounts of \"mechanical work and meaningless homework\".<ref name=\"Vickers\">Vickers, Edward. [2003] (2003). In Search of an Identity: The Politics of History Teaching in Hong Kong, 1960s\u20132000. United Kingdom: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94502-X}}</ref> In particular, history education has been recognised as ineffective, with critics claiming that the curriculum is not capable of delivering a sense of identity. Not only that, students have to memorise the whole history texts, thereby indicating that rote-learning has greater priority than absorbing and understanding material.<ref name=\"Vickers\" />\n\nSome {{who|date=March 2017}} have criticised the system for having too narrow of a stream focus, too early on. [[Hong Kong Legislative Council|Legco]] Member [[Alan Leong]] argued in a guest lecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong that secondary level science students are incapable of participating in meaningful discussions on history, arts, or literature.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Vice versa journalists of arts stream background are incapable of accurately discussing technological issues. The narrow focus of education in Hong Kong has been a concern.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe pervasive perception from observers in overseas education institutions generally is that a typical Hong Kong student compared with other students, even against other students in the Asia region, lacks systematic decision-making confidence and relies on repetition and undeveloped answers. This deviates from the common benchmark of intellect where value propositions are generated from innovation and distinctive solutions, and this has led to much schism in the debate of educational direction of Hong Kong, where the populace makes no such aspiration for intellect but seek constant reaffirmation of the value of myriad certificates obtained through pedagogy throughout their working lives. The desperation to seek standing in life through education is further highlighted by severe ironies such as:\n\n# Senior education officials often acclaim the excellence of Hong Kong education, yet few if any will let their children matriculate locally, preferring overseas universities instead.\n# A certificate driven society that takes pride in its academic excellence is unable to devise a suitable benchmark of excellence itself, with a low public approval of the local educational system, relies on certification from outside Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Education by country]]\n* [[Education in the UK]]\n* [[Education in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[List of schools in Hong Kong]]\n* [[List of universities in Hong Kong]]\n* [[334 Scheme]] (New Senior Secondary Scheme)\n* [[EMI schools]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tang, Kwok-Chun ([[Hong Kong Baptist University]]) and Mark Bray ([[University of Hong Kong]]). \"[http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00238I/WEB/PDF/TANG_BRA.PDF Colonial models and the evolution of education systems: centralization and decentralization in Hong Kong and Macau].\" [[World Bank]].\n*Chan, Anita K.W. and Lucille L.S.

In junior years, the curriculum is a broad one where history, geography, and science are studied alongside subjects that have already been studied at primary schools. In senior years, this becomes more selective and students have a choice over what and how much is to be studied. Almost all schools but [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]] and its feeder junior secondary college have both sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itseducation.asia/education-system.htm|title=The Hong Kong Education System and school system explained|access-date=7 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903115913/http://www.itseducation.asia/education-system.htm|archive-date=3 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Further education===\n\nThe commerce stream in secondary schools is considered [[Vocational Education|vocational]]. Students in the Commerce stream would usually enter the workplace to gain practical work experience by this point. Further education pursuits in the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education or universities abroad are common. The [[Manpower Development Committee]] (MDC) advises the government on coordination, regulation, and promotion of the sector. Also, the [[Vocational Training Council]] (VTC) ensures the level of standard is met through the ''\"Apprentice Ordinance\"''. The VTC also operates three skills-centres for people with disabilities. secondary schools in Hong Kong are going to be cut down to only two years due to the switch in the government.\n\n===Alternative education options===\n\nInternational institutions provide both primary and secondary education in Hong Kong. International institutions like schools within the [[English Schools Foundation]], [[Li Po Chun United World College]], [[Hong Kong International School]], [[American International School Hong Kong]], [[Chinese International School]], [http://www.vsa.edu.hk Victoria Shanghai Academy] [[German Swiss International School]], [[Canadian International School of Hong Kong|Canadian International School]], [[Hong Kong Japanese School]], [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais International Victor Segalen|French International School]], [[Yew Chung International School]], [[Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School]], [[Singapore International School]], and [[Harrow International School Hong Kong]] teach with English as the primary language, with some sections bilingual in German, French and Chinese. International school students rarely take Hong Kong public exams. British students take [[GCSE]], [[IGCSE]], and A-levels. US students take [[Advanced Placement|AP]]s. Increasingly, international schools follow the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IBDP) program and enter universities through non-[[JUPAS]] direct entry. International students apply on a per-school basis, whereas Hong Kong local students submit 1 application for multiple local universities as a JUPAS applicant.\n\n==Tertiary and Higher education==\n\n[[File:The University of Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|[[University of Hong Kong]].]]\n{{Main|Higher education in Hong Kong}}\n\nHigher education remains exclusive in Hong Kong.

The operators have fee remission schemes to help adult learners in need of financial assistance. Adult education courses also provide Vocational Training Council through universities and private institutions. The [[Open University of Hong Kong]] is one establishment for mature students.

Historically non-local students from other Asian countries attended government schools while white students attended private schools instead.

The two sessions are usually treated as separate school entities with two different headmasters. To make up for the time of shortened half days, students are sometimes required to attend alternate Saturdays. Most primary schools are gradually moving to full school day systems as government policy aims to phase out half-day schooling over time as resource permits.\n\nDue to the drop in [[birth rate]] in recent years, many primary schools were forced to cut classes, cut teachers and even close down. There have been debates that one should seize the opportunity to promote small class teaching.  Doing so could mitigate the pressure of teachers, class and school reductions, on top of improving ratio of students to teachers.\n\n==Discipline==\n\nGood behaviour has always been emphasised in Hong Kong, to the point that it is sometimes said to hinder pupils' development. Misbehavior is recorded and shown on school reports. The Education Bureau (EDB) provides the 'Guidelines for Student Disciplines' to schools to as guidance in creating a disciplined education environment. It outlines the principles and policies regarding student discipline, the organisational structure of a school discipline team, the roles and responsibilities of the discipline master and mistress, and discipline strategies illustrated with case studies.<ref>{{cite web|first1=|title=Student Guidance and Discipline Services|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/student-parents/student-guidance-discipline-services/overview/index.html|website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719191521/http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/student-parents/student-guidance-discipline-services/overview/index.html|archive-date=19 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{see also|Hong Kong Kids phenomenon|Monster parents}}\n\n===Spoon feeding===\n\nEducation in Hong Kong has often been described as 'spoon fed'. [[Cram schools in Hong Kong]] have also become a popular standard in parallel to regular education. Teachers focus on helping students getting high scores in the major exams and heavily rely on textbook knowledge rather than exchanging ideas and essence of the subjects.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chong, Chan|first1=Dennis, Joyee|title=Students 'spoon-fed'|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1006323/students-spoon-fed|accessdate=4 August 2015|agency=South China Morning Post|date=9 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095939/http://www.scmp.com/article/1006323/students-spoon-fed|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Education reform===\n{{OR-section|date=June 2018}}\nWith the advent of education reform there is a greater emphasis on group projects, open-ended assignments on top of traditional homework. The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately two hours of schoolwork nightly. Along with [[extra-curricular activities]], Hong Kong's education has become synonymous for leaning towards quantity. As early as March 1987, education advisory inspectors became concerned with the excessive amounts of \"mechanical work and meaningless homework\".<ref name=\"Vickers\">Vickers, Edward. [2003] (2003). In Search of an Identity: The Politics of History Teaching in Hong Kong, 1960s\u20132000. United Kingdom: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94502-X}}</ref> In particular, history education has been recognised as ineffective, with critics claiming that the curriculum is not capable of delivering a sense of identity. Not only that, students have to memorise the whole history texts, thereby indicating that rote-learning has greater priority than absorbing and understanding material.<ref name=\"Vickers\" />\n\nSome {{who|date=March 2017}} have criticised the system for having too narrow of a stream focus, too early on. [[Hong Kong Legislative Council|Legco]] Member [[Alan Leong]] argued in a guest lecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong that secondary level science students are incapable of participating in meaningful discussions on history, arts, or literature.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Vice versa journalists of arts stream background are incapable of accurately discussing technological issues. The narrow focus of education in Hong Kong has been a concern.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe pervasive perception from observers in overseas education institutions generally is that a typical Hong Kong student compared with other students, even against other students in the Asia region, lacks systematic decision-making confidence and relies on repetition and undeveloped answers. This deviates from the common benchmark of intellect where value propositions are generated from innovation and distinctive solutions, and this has led to much schism in the debate of educational direction of Hong Kong, where the populace makes no such aspiration for intellect but seek constant reaffirmation of the value of myriad certificates obtained through pedagogy throughout their working lives. The desperation to seek standing in life through education is further highlighted by severe ironies such as:\n\n# Senior education officials often acclaim the excellence of Hong Kong education, yet few if any will let their children matriculate locally, preferring overseas universities instead.\n# A certificate driven society that takes pride in its academic excellence is unable to devise a suitable benchmark of excellence itself, with a low public approval of the local educational system, relies on certification from outside Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Education by country]]\n* [[Education in the UK]]\n* [[Education in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[List of schools in Hong Kong]]\n* [[List of universities in Hong Kong]]\n* [[334 Scheme]] (New Senior Secondary Scheme)\n* [[EMI schools]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tang, Kwok-Chun ([[Hong Kong Baptist University]]) and Mark Bray ([[University of Hong Kong]]). \"[http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00238I/WEB/PDF/TANG_BRA.PDF Colonial models and the evolution of education systems: centralization and decentralization in Hong Kong and Macau].\" [[World Bank]].\n*Chan, Anita K.W. and Lucille L.S.

Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been \"under review\" before the lawsuit was filed.
