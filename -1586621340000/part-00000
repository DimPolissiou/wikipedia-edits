The school's mission is to educate its students either in the [[religious studies|academic study of religion]] or for leadership roles in religion, government, and service.<ref>{{cite web |title=About HDS |url=https://hds.harvard.edu/about |website=Harvard Divinity School |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> It also caters to students from other Harvard schools that are interested in the former field. HDS is among a small group of university-based, non-denominational [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] schools in the United States (others include [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], [[Yale Divinity School]], [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]], and [[Wake Forest University School of Divinity]]).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Andover Hall, Harvard Divinity School - general view.JPG|thumb|left|Andover Hall]]\nHarvard College was founded in 1636 as a [[Puritan]]/[[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] institution and trained ministers for many years.  The separate institution of the Divinity School, however, dates from 1816, when it was established as the first non-denominational divinity school in the United States. ([[Princeton Theological Seminary]] had been founded as a [[Presbyterian]] institution in 1812. [[Andover Theological Seminary]] was founded in 1807 by orthodox [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] who fled [[Harvard College]] after it appointed liberal theologian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] to the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professorship of Divinity]] in 1805.)\n\nDuring its first century, Harvard Divinity School was unofficially associated with [[American Unitarian Association|American Unitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636-1926|date=1964|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674888913|pages=242\u2013243|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_Centuries_of_Harvard_1636_1936.html?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref> However, it also retains a historical tie to one of the successor denominations of American Congregationalism, the [[United Church of Christ]].\n[[File:Andover Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Andover Hall]]\n\n===Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism===\nThroughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalist#United States|Congregationalist]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>{{cite book|last1=Dorrien|first1=Gary|title=The Making of American Liberal Theology|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=9780664223540|page=195|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbJzVH7DOc4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Gary+J.+Dorrien%22#v=onepage&q=age%20of%20enlightenment|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20134}}\n\nWhen the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professor of Divinity]] [[David Tappan]] died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, the overseer of the college [[Jedidiah Morse]] demanded that orthodox men be elected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY|isbn=9780664224097|page=393|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PA393&lpg=PA393&dq=jedidiah+morse+and+harvard&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, after much struggle, the Unitarian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, [[Calvinist]] ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas (defined by traditionalists as [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian]] ideas).<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Peter S.|title=Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lewiston, NY|isbn=9780847688425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXHbEWJacwwC|accessdate=7 January 2016|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|24}} The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the [[Andover Theological Seminary]] as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\n===Today===\nToday, students and faculty come from a variety of religious backgrounds: Christian (all denominations), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and others. Its academic programs attempt to balance theology and religious studies\u2014that is, the \"believer's\" perspective on religion with the \"secular\" perspective on religion. This is in contrast to many other divinity schools where one or the other is given primacy ([[Yale Divinity School]], for example, emphasizes its theological program, while the majority of students at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] enroll in its \"religious studies\" Master of Arts program).\n\n==Degrees==\nHarvard Divinity School is [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS) and approved by ATS to grant the following degrees:<ref name=ats>{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|title=Member Schools: Harvard University Divinity School|publisher=[[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]]|accessdate=2009-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917190508/http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*[[Master of Theological Studies]] (MTS)\n*[[Master of Divinity]] (MDiv)\n*[[Master of Theology]] (ThM)\n*[[Doctor of Theology]] (ThD) (discontinued, see below){{refend}}\n\nIn addition to candidates for the above, many Harvard graduate students pursuing PhDs in the study of religion work closely with Divinity School faculty. These students are formally affiliated with the Committee on the Study of Religion which is made up of 50% Arts and Sciences and 50% Divinity faculty members and housed in the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nIn April 2014, the faculty of HDS voted to discontinue the ThD in favor of the PhD in the study of religion in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (GSAS), suspending admission to the ThD. Those previously admitted to the ThD program continue to be candidates for the ThD, with the first cohort of PhD candidates entering in fall 2015.<ref>http://hds.harvard.edu/academics/degree-programs</ref> While many PhD students in the GSAS take courses at HDS, and HDS continues to advertise the PhD in the study of religion, PhD students are formally enrolled in the GSAS and not HDS; only the GSAS at Harvard may award the PhD.\n\n==Curriculum==\nCandidates for the MTS choose among 18 areas of academic focus:\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Africa]]n and [[African Americans|African American]] Religious Studies\n* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Studies\n* Comparative Religious Studies\n* East Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Hebrew Bible]] / [[Old Testament]]\n* [[History of Christianity]]\n* [[Hindu Studies]]\n* South Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Islam]]ic Studies\n* [[Jews|Jewish]] Studies\n* [[New Testament]] and Early Christianity\n* [[Philosophy of Religion]]\n* Religions of the Americas\n* Religion, Ethics, and Politics\n* Religion, Literature, and Culture\n* Religious Studies and Education\n* [[Theology]]\n* Women, Gender, Sexuality, and Religion\n{{refend}}\n\nCandidates for the MDiv are required to take:\n* Three courses in the theories, methods, and practices of scriptural interpretation within the student's religious tradition\n* Six courses in the history, theology, and practice of the student's religious tradition in which they are preparing to minister\n* Three courses within a religious tradition different from the one they are studying\n\n==Research and special programs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Women's Studies in Religion Program===\nThe Women's Studies in Religion Program (WSRP) at Harvard Divinity School was founded in 1973 and was the first program offering an interdisciplinary study of women and religion. Since its founding, it has supported more than 100 scholars, from over 50 institutions of higher learning in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe WSRP promotes critical inquiry into the interaction between religion and gender, and every year the program brings five postdoctoral scholars to HDS. The research associates each work on a book-length research project and teach courses related to their research.\n\n==={{anchor|Center for the Study of World Religions}}Center for the Study of World Religions===\n\n[[Image:CSWR.png|thumb|right|Rear view of the CSWR designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]]]]\n\nFounded in 1960 after an anonymous donation in 1957, the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School is a residential community of academic fellows, graduate students, and visiting professors of many world religious traditions. The Center focuses on the understanding of religions globally through its research, publications, funding, and public programs. It welcomes scholars and practitioners and highlights the intellectual and historical dimensions of religious dialogue. {{as of|2017|July|1|df=US}}, its current director is Charles Stang, a scholar of ancient Christianity, focusing especially on Eastern varieties of late antique Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hds.harvard.edu/news/2017/04/04/charles-stang-named-director-center-study-world-religions|title=Charles Stang Named Director of Center for the Study of World Religions|website=hds.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref> The Center sponsors a diverse range of educative programs, ranging from public lectures to colloquia and reading groups, student-initiated projects, and \"religion in the news\" lunches on topics of public interest. The Center's Meditation Room is used regularly by individuals and groups.\n\nThe building that houses the Center was designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]].\n\n===Summer Leadership Institute===\nThe Summer Leadership Institute (SLI), which has been discontinued, was a two-week training program that sought to establish theological instruction and grounding for individuals engaged in community and economic development.\n\nThe program of study was divided into four modules: Theology, Ethics, and Public Policy; Organizational Development and Management; Housing and Community Development; and Finance and Economic Development. It was a full-time residential program, holding classes five days a week, with an emphasis on faith-based case studies of corporations and communities.\n\nSince the SLI's inauguration in 1998, more than 450 participants have completed the program. About 50 people were selected each year from around the United States and internationally to participate in lectures, seminars, and field visits with faculty from across Harvard and other recognized experts. Participants also developed individual plans of action, on a case-study model, applicable to the local work in their communities.\n\n===Program in Religion and Secondary Education===\nThe Program in Religion and Secondary Education is a teacher education program that prepares students to teach about religion in public schools from a non-sectarian perspective. Students in the master of theological studies or master of divinity degree programs integrate their work in religion with courses on education and public policy to understand the relationship between religion and education and to advance religious literacy within their fields of licensure.\n\nHarvard Divinity School's Program in Religious Studies and Education (PRSE) has been temporarily suspended, pending new permanent funding that will allow the program to continue and to be capable of serving more students than can currently be admitted into the program. Beginning with the 2009\u201310 academic year, no new students will be admitted to the program for at least the next two years. Students who are already in the PRSE will continue and be able to finish their degrees in normal fashion.\n\n==Andover-Harvard Theological Library==\n\n[[Image:Andover Library.png|thumb|right|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]\n\n[[Andover-Harvard Theological Library]] was founded in 1836 and underwent expansion in 1911 when the collections of HDS and [[Andover Theological Seminary]] were combined. The Library is part of the larger Harvard University library system, which is available to all faculty, staff, and students at HDS. In September 2001, the library completed a $12-million renovation that enhanced its technology facilities and improved its information systems.

The school's mission is to educate its students either in the [[religious studies|academic study of religion]] or for leadership roles in religion, government, and service.<ref>{{cite web |title=About HDS |url=https://hds.harvard.edu/about |website=Harvard Divinity School |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> It also caters to students from other Harvard schools that are interested in the former field. HDS is among a small group of university-based, non-denominational [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] schools in the United States (others include [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], [[Yale Divinity School]], [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]], and [[Wake Forest University School of Divinity]]).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Andover Hall, Harvard Divinity School - general view.JPG|thumb|left|Andover Hall]]\nHarvard College was founded in 1636 as a [[Puritan]]/[[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] institution and trained ministers for many years.  The separate institution of the Divinity School, however, dates from 1816, when it was established as the first non-denominational divinity school in the United States. ([[Princeton Theological Seminary]] had been founded as a [[Presbyterian]] institution in 1812. [[Andover Theological Seminary]] was founded in 1807 by orthodox [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] who fled [[Harvard College]] after it appointed liberal theologian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] to the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professorship of Divinity]] in 1805.)\n\nDuring its first century, Harvard Divinity School was unofficially associated with [[American Unitarian Association|American Unitarianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636-1926|date=1964|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674888913|pages=242\u2013243|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Three_Centuries_of_Harvard_1636_1936.html?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref> However, it also retains a historical tie to one of the successor denominations of American Congregationalism, the [[United Church of Christ]].\n[[File:Andover Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Andover Hall]]\n\n===Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism===\nThroughout the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among [[Congregationalist#United States|Congregationalist]] ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, [[Calvinist]] parties.<ref name=Dorrien>{{cite book|last1=Dorrien|first1=Gary|title=The Making of American Liberal Theology|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=9780664223540|page=195|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbJzVH7DOc4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Gary+J.+Dorrien%22#v=onepage&q=age%20of%20enlightenment|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20134}}\n\nWhen the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis Professor of Divinity]] [[David Tappan]] died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, the overseer of the college [[Jedidiah Morse]] demanded that orthodox men be elected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall|title=The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism|date=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY|isbn=9780664224097|page=393|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&pg=PA393&lpg=PA393&dq=jedidiah+morse+and+harvard&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, after much struggle, the Unitarian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, [[Calvinist]] ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, [[Arminianism|Arminian]] ideas (defined by traditionalists as [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian]] ideas).<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Peter S.|title=Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lewiston, NY|isbn=9780847688425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXHbEWJacwwC|accessdate=7 January 2016|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|24}} The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal [[Samuel Webber]] to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the [[Andover Theological Seminary]] as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.<ref name=Dorrien/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\n===Today===\nToday, students and faculty come from a variety of religious backgrounds: Christian (all denominations), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and others. Its academic programs attempt to balance theology and religious studies\u2014that is, the \"believer's\" perspective on religion with the \"secular\" perspective on religion. This is in contrast to many other divinity schools where one or the other is given primacy ([[Yale Divinity School]], for example, emphasizes its theological program, while the majority of students at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] enroll in its \"religious studies\" Master of Arts program).\n\n==Degrees==\nHarvard Divinity School is [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS) and approved by ATS to grant the following degrees:<ref name=ats>{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|title=Member Schools: Harvard University Divinity School|publisher=[[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]]|accessdate=2009-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917190508/http://www.ats.edu/MemberSchools/Pages/SchoolDetail.aspx?ID=387|archivedate=17 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*[[Master of Theological Studies]] (MTS)\n*[[Master of Divinity]] (MDiv)\n*[[Master of Theology]] (ThM)\n*[[Doctor of Theology]] (ThD) (discontinued, see below){{refend}}\n\nIn addition to candidates for the above, many Harvard graduate students pursuing PhDs in the study of religion work closely with Divinity School faculty. These students are formally affiliated with the Committee on the Study of Religion which is made up of 50% Arts and Sciences and 50% Divinity faculty members and housed in the [[Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nIn April 2014, the faculty of HDS voted to discontinue the ThD in favor of the PhD in the study of religion in the [[Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (GSAS), suspending admission to the ThD. Those previously admitted to the ThD program continue to be candidates for the ThD, with the first cohort of PhD candidates entering in fall 2015.<ref>http://hds.harvard.edu/academics/degree-programs</ref> While many PhD students in the GSAS take courses at HDS, and HDS continues to advertise the PhD in the study of religion, PhD students are formally enrolled in the GSAS and not HDS; only the GSAS at Harvard may award the PhD.\n\n==Curriculum==\nCandidates for the MTS choose among 18 areas of academic focus:\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* [[Africa]]n and [[African Americans|African American]] Religious Studies\n* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Studies\n* Comparative Religious Studies\n* East Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Hebrew Bible]] / [[Old Testament]]\n* [[History of Christianity]]\n* [[Hindu Studies]]\n* South Asian Religious Studies\n* [[Islam]]ic Studies\n* [[Jews|Jewish]] Studies\n* [[New Testament]] and Early Christianity\n* [[Philosophy of Religion]]\n* Religions of the Americas\n* Religion, Ethics, and Politics\n* Religion, Literature, and Culture\n* Religious Studies and Education\n* [[Theology]]\n* Women, Gender, Sexuality, and Religion\n{{refend}}\n\nCandidates for the MDiv are required to take:\n* Three courses in the theories, methods, and practices of scriptural interpretation within the student's religious tradition\n* Six courses in the history, theology, and practice of the student's religious tradition in which they are preparing to minister\n* Three courses within a religious tradition different from the one they are studying\n\n==Research and special programs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Women's Studies in Religion Program===\nThe Women's Studies in Religion Program (WSRP) at Harvard Divinity School was founded in 1973 and was the first program offering an interdisciplinary study of women and religion. Since its founding, it has supported more than 100 scholars, from over 50 institutions of higher learning in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe WSRP promotes critical inquiry into the interaction between religion and gender, and every year the program brings five postdoctoral scholars to HDS. The research associates each work on a book-length research project and teach courses related to their research.\n\n==={{anchor|Center for the Study of World Religions}}Center for the Study of World Religions===\n\n[[Image:CSWR.png|thumb|right|Rear view of the CSWR designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]]]]\n\nFounded in 1960 after an anonymous donation in 1957, the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School is a residential community of academic fellows, graduate students, and visiting professors of many world religious traditions. The Center focuses on the understanding of religions globally through its research, publications, funding, and public programs. It welcomes scholars and practitioners and highlights the intellectual and historical dimensions of religious dialogue. {{as of|2017|July|1|df=US}}, its current director is Charles Stang, a scholar of ancient Christianity, focusing especially on Eastern varieties of late antique Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hds.harvard.edu/news/2017/04/04/charles-stang-named-director-center-study-world-religions|title=Charles Stang Named Director of Center for the Study of World Religions|website=hds.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref> The Center sponsors a diverse range of educative programs, ranging from public lectures to colloquia and reading groups, student-initiated projects, and \"religion in the news\" lunches on topics of public interest. The Center's Meditation Room is used regularly by individuals and groups.\n\nThe building that houses the Center was designed by [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]].\n\n===Summer Leadership Institute===\nThe Summer Leadership Institute (SLI), which has been discontinued, was a two-week training program that sought to establish theological instruction and grounding for individuals engaged in community and economic development.\n\nThe program of study was divided into four modules: Theology, Ethics, and Public Policy; Organizational Development and Management; Housing and Community Development; and Finance and Economic Development. It was a full-time residential program, holding classes five days a week, with an emphasis on faith-based case studies of corporations and communities.\n\nSince the SLI's inauguration in 1998, more than 450 participants have completed the program. About 50 people were selected each year from around the United States and internationally to participate in lectures, seminars, and field visits with faculty from across Harvard and other recognized experts. Participants also developed individual plans of action, on a case-study model, applicable to the local work in their communities.\n\n===Program in Religion and Secondary Education===\nThe Program in Religion and Secondary Education is a teacher education program that prepares students to teach about religion in public schools from a non-sectarian perspective. Students in the master of theological studies or master of divinity degree programs integrate their work in religion with courses on education and public policy to understand the relationship between religion and education and to advance religious literacy within their fields of licensure.\n\nHarvard Divinity School's Program in Religious Studies and Education (PRSE) has been temporarily suspended, pending new permanent funding that will allow the program to continue and to be capable of serving more students than can currently be admitted into the program. Beginning with the 2009\u201310 academic year, no new students will be admitted to the program for at least the next two years. Students who are already in the PRSE will continue and be able to finish their degrees in normal fashion.\n\n==Andover-Harvard Theological Library==\n\n[[Image:Andover Library.png|thumb|right|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]\n\n[[Andover-Harvard Theological Library]] was founded in 1836 and underwent expansion in 1911 when the collections of HDS and [[Andover Theological Seminary]] were combined. The Library is part of the larger Harvard University library system, which is available to all faculty, staff, and students at HDS. In September 2001, the library completed a $12-million renovation that enhanced its technology facilities and improved its information systems.

Nicknamed \"The Chloroform Killer\", Bolsen is a Colorado native who confessed to the killing of a German engineer in 2006. Bolsen claimed the incident was not pre-meditated, though the Sharja court says it was a premeditated plan by Bolsen to lure in Steiner and kill him. E-mails turned to phone conversations and Steiner and Bolsen, allegedly posing as the maid, agreed to meet on June 12, 2006, after Steiner finished work. According to the court, he had been told he would have a sexual encounter with an Emirati woman.\n\nA struggle followed. Bolsen said he reached for his chloroform, an anesthetic once popular with doctors, that he said he used to help with his insomnia. Bolsen said he intended to sedate Steiner, not kill him. But in the maid Yousef's initial testimony, she said she had stepped out of the room and returned to find Steiner on the bed. She told the Sharjah's Criminal Court of First Instance that Bolsen \"said 'do not worry, but say Allahu akbar, for an infidel is dead'.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/courts/shahid-king-bolsen-s-troubled-road-to-sharjah-s-death-row-1.527883|title=Shahid King Bolsen's troubled road to Sharjah's Death Row|website=The National|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nBolsen is not the only controversial partner in The Detained In Dubai organisation.

[[Ice yachting]] is the [[sport]] of [[sailing]] and racing iceboats. Sail-able ice is known in the sport as \"hard water\" versus sailing on liquid or \"soft\" water. A related sport, [[land sailing]], utilizes a configuration with an iceboat-like fuselage or frame equipped with wheels instead of runners. Iceboats commonly used for racing are usually only for one person, but several classes of two-seat and multiple-seat iceboats are more or less common. On some boats, a \"side car\" can be fitted to take others along for a ride.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\nThe first iceboats were probably converted from canal vessels used in the [[Netherlands]], where due to the [[Little Ice Age]] - a cooler [[Climate change (general concept)|climatic period]] lasting from the [[15th century|15th]] to the [[19th century]] - the canals were typically covered with ice for up to 5 months a year. Due to the winters lasted for almost half a year, trade and the transport of goods through the canals could not stop, so ingenious merchants put their boats on skates with the help of a plank, thus making them usable even during wintertime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://icesailing.nl/|title=ijszeilvereniging \"De Robben\" uit Kaag|website=icesailing.nl|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nTraditional iceboats from before the late 19th century were used for transportation of goods and racing. These boats reached lengths of {{convert|30|to|50|ft|m}} and were sometimes transported between sites on rail cars. Ice sailing was first developed in Europe. \n\nIn America, it was done in several locations where the sport also continues today. Many active ice sailing clubs are thriving in the northern States and Canadian Provinces, including on the [[Hudson River]]; [[Long Island Sound]]; [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; [[Sandusky, Ohio]]; [[Gull Lake (Michigan)|Gull Lake, Michigan]]; [[Lake Muskegon]], [[Michigan]]; [[Geneva Lake]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]; Hamilton Bay, Ontario, Rondeau Bay, Ontario; [[Ghost Lake, Alberta]], [[Fort Peck Lake|Fort Peck Lake, Montana]] and on other venues as far south as Decatur and Springfield, Illinois. Some of the older large \"stern steerer\" iceboats can seat several in their \"baskets.\" Several of these boats are maintained and raced today. The Northwest Ice Yacht Association sponsors an annual [[regatta]] that includes classes for these boats. This annual regatta recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe first iceboat in America is attributed to Oliver Booth in 1790 at Poughkeepsie, NY.  This craft was a small triangular box with two runners affixed to the front and a steering runner at the rear.\n\nOne unique type of ice boat has its history in wide, stubby, scow-like vessels used in the 1800s, often for transportation across a mixed passage transitioning over sea-ice and open water. Wildly sailed by adjusting main and jib sail trim only, these boats had no rudder. Parallel rails were mounted on the bottom, like multiple sled runners. These early vessels (called an \"ice scooter\" or \"bay scooter\") were capable of simultaneously and daringly traversing both open water and jumping onto stretches of ice and were used primarily for winter [[transportation]] to and from lighthouses and for [[ice fishing]]. In 1869, one of the largest ice yachts ever was built for racing on the frozen [[Hudson River]], called the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''. That boat occasionally raced the railroad which ran alongside the Hudson.\n\nThe first iceboats were adaptations of regular sailing boats, with a wooden plank fastened cross-wise at the front having a fixed runner at each end, and a steering runner attached to the bottom of the rudder at the [[stern]] (back). These early ice sailing [[marine vessel|vessels]] led to the development of boats designed strictly for racing on ice. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''. This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into a very efficient aerodynamically clean machine. While the large stern-steerers could have up to {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of sail, the Skeeter class is limited to just {{convert|75|sqft|m2}} of sail.\n\nIn 1937, The [[Detroit News]] sponsored a new home-buildable ice boat design, which became the [[International DN]]. In 1968 Dick Slates of [[Pewaukee, Wisconsin]] designed and built the ''Nite'' with two wooden prototypes. The design was refined and fiberglass production began in 1970.\n\n==Modern designs==\n[[File:Ice yachters on Hudson River near Barrytown, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Ice yachters on [[Hudson River]] at [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown, NY]]|alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them. In the far right upper background a portion of a bridge is visible]]\nModern iceboats designs are generally supported by three skate blades called \"runners\" supporting a triangular or cross-shaped frame with the steering runner in front. Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails. Once the lateral force has been effectively countered by the runner edge, the remaining force of \"sail-lift\" vacuums the boat forward with significant power. That power increases as the speed of the boat increases, allowing the boat to go much faster than the wind. The only seeming limitations to iceboat speed are windage, friction, the camber of the sail shape, strength of construction, quality of the ice surface and the level of skill, athleticism and fearlessness of the sailor.<ref>An elementary introduction to the relevant physics can be found at the bottom of the page {{cite web |url=http://iceboat.org/faqiceboat.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309200937/http://www.iceboat.org/faqiceboat.html |archive-date=2011-03-09 |df= }}</ref> Iceboats can sail as close as 7 degrees off the apparent wind.<ref>See page 204 of {{cite book\n |last = Bethwaite\n |first = Frank\n |title = High Performance Sailing\n |publisher = Adlard Coles Nautical\n |year = 2007\n |isbn = 978-0-7136-6704-2}}</ref>\n\nModern designs of iceboats are very efficient, utilizing aerodynamic designs and low friction, and can achieve speeds as high as ten times the [[wind speed]] in good conditions. [[International DN]] iceboats often achieve speeds of {{convert|48|knots|km/h mph}} while racing, and speeds as high as {{convert|59|knots|km/h mph}} have been recorded.<ref name=Boat_Speed>{{Citation\n | first = Bob\n | last = Dill\n | contribution = Sailing Yacht Design for Maximum Speed\n | contribution-url = http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/572109/24503675/1394724903587/Sailing+Yacht+Design+for+Maximum+Speed.pdf?token=5pzNaaWIFu%2F7e3pN5RiQ2e6MmmM%3D\n | title = The 16th Chesapeake Sailing Yacht Symposium\n | date = March 2003\n | pages =\n | place = Anapolis\n | publisher = SNAME\n | url = http://www.sname.org/chesapeakesailingyachtsymposiumcsys/pastpapers/16thcsys }}</ref> Skeeters and older large stern-steerer iceboats can exceed {{convert|90|knots|km/h mph}}. The rumored, but unconfirmed, top speed of an iceboat is over {{convert|130|knots|km/h mph}}. One reference to a timed run on Lake Geneva, Wisconsin reported an \"E-Skeeter\" as having reached {{convert|137|knots|km/h mph}}. The same reference reported clocking a DN 60 iceboat on a closed course over black ice on Green Bay, Wisconsin at {{convert|94|knots|km/h mph}}. The stern-steerer ''Debutaunte'', recently rebuilt, was timed over a measured mile at {{convert|124|knots|km/h mph}} on the ice of [[Lake Winnebago]], Wisconsin in 1938.\n\nBecause of the very high potential boat speeds, iceboat race courses are established around fixed marks which are to be rounded in a one-way route. The courses are deliberately set in a straight line [[upwind]] and [[downwind]], though the boats have to tack back and forth to advance through the course. This course configuration provides a measure of traffic safety between competitors. Also, by directing the iceboat straight upwind or straight downwind, the sailor can best control the sail and limit the aerodynamic force; these are the slowest directions of travel. Recorded racing speeds for an [[International DN]] in {{convert|9|knots|km/h mph}} winds are {{convert|26|knots|km/h mph}} upwind, and {{convert|35|knots|km/h mph}} downwind.<ref>Dill, Bob (2004-Feb): [http://www.ice.idniyra.org/articles/IceboatSailingPerformance.html \"Putting Numbers on Iceboat Sailing Performance\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''idniyra.org'', retrieved on 2009-01-14</ref> A downwind speed of {{convert|49|knots|km/h mph}} was recorded at a World Championship in winds of just {{convert|13|to|15|knots|km/h mph}}.<ref name=Boat_Speed/>\n\nIceboats are not produced commercially on a wide scale, but remain largely the province of hobbyists and enthusiasts building with high quality wood and plywood and more exotic materials such as foam, carbon fiber, fiberglass and epoxy. There are no known governmental licensing or registration requirements. Several classes are organized and boats must conform to the designs and rules of the classes in order to race.\n\nIce boats may have [[Lateen#Modern small-boat lateen sails|Sunfish rig]]s, [[Bermuda rig]]s, [[gaff rig]]s (see image) and even [[kite rig]]s.<ref>http://www.instructables.com/id/Traditional-Polynesian-Ice-Canoe-Ice-Proa/</ref>\n\n==Classes==\nThe [[International DN]] class is the most popular class in both North America and Europe. It is a one-person wood boat twelve feet long with a cross \"plank\" eight feet long and carries a mast {{convert|16|ft|m}} high. Modern competitive DNs use flexible masts commonly made of composite materials. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20171227121944/https://ice.idniyra.org/ ice.idniyra.org] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20061205014651/http://icesailing.org/ icesailing.org]. As noted above, the DN 60 name came as a result of a request published in the late 1930s by the Detroit News newspaper for a design to build a relatively inexpensive one-person iceboat that showed excellent performance, yet could be quickly built and sailed easily. The high-performance, modern DN is a far cry in materials and construction from the original design selected by the Detroit News. Yet, many of its one-design features are exactly the same as the original boat, including the basic aerodynamic fuselage design, runner configurations and {{convert|60|sqft|m2}} of high-performance sail.\n\nThe IceOptimist<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idniyra.eu/juniors/|title=ICE OPTI and DN JUNIOR \u2013 IDNIYRA \u2013 Europe|website=idniyra.eu|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> is a youth iceboat class that uses the sails and the rig of the [[Optimist (dinghy)|International Optimist dinghy]]. The first design was built in [[Estonia]] in 1978, with a scaled down elements of a [[International DN|DN]]. In [[2002]], the class was registered under the guardianship of IDNIYRA Europe with the permission of IODA. World and European Championships are sailed each winter with a fleet of approx. 40 racers.\n\nThe Skeeter class is divided into sub-classes (A, B and C) all of which are limited to {{convert|75|sqft|m2}} of sail area. A class boats are single seat, have mast heights in excess of 26&nbsp;ft and include bubble boats and rumble seaters. These boats are the fastest skeeters around and are on the cutting edge of technology using carbon fiber in their construction. B class skeeters are two seat boats (side by side seating) with 23 to 25&nbsp;ft masts, examples of B skeeters are the eastern Yankee and western Boe-Craft skeeters (www.boecraft.com). C class skeeters are single seat and are limited to a mast height of 20&nbsp;ft 3in or less. Some one-design classes have evolved within the C Skeeter class as well. These include the Nite, Renegade and J14 (C class), which have a wide and enthusiastic following, and several locally popular classes at iceboating locations. The International Skeeter Association holds an annual regatta to bring all the classes together to race. The skeeters have a limited number of rules, including a requirement for a cloth sail, and some restrictions on mast profile. Modern \"A\" skeeters are the fastest boats on ice. Some have fully enclosed cockpits and mast heights up to {{convert|30|ft|m}}. The \"A\" class sail is measured at {{convert|72|sqft|m2}}, which is the area of the triangle between the ends of the [[boom (sailing)|boom]] and the top of the mast. The actual sail area is much larger, as the \"roach\" of the sail outside this triangle is unmeasured. Also, the wing-mast and large [[aerodynamic]] boom is also unmeasured.\n\n==Icy areas==\nIceboating's popularity is primarily limited to the northern continental United States and Europe, as few places elsewhere have ice thick enough to safely use the vessels for an extended duration. Despite the ephemeral nature of perfect racing conditions in which a steady not-too-cold breeze combines with a broad stretch of flawless black ice, [[regatta]]s are held regularly, including local, regional, continental and world championships. In the United States there are active regattas around the [[Great Lakes]], and [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] in [[New Hampshire]], to [[Lake Minnetonka]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and in [[Wisconsin]] at [[Pewaukee Lake]], [[Geneva Lake]], [[Lake Winnebago]] and the lakes surrounding [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], several lakes in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] and several Western lakes. All are within the \"ice belt\" of approximately 40\u00b0N latitude to 45\u00b0-50\u00b0N latitude where it gets cold enough to freeze water to several inches thick before snow covers them. There is an active group of sailors on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], where sail-able ice appears irregularly. Once a thick snow fall occurs, iceboaters must wait for the snow to melt completely then refreeze or travel to another lake/area. The preferred condition of [[Black ice (lakes)|\"black ice\"]] is smooth clear ice that has no snow and has frozen in a state of smoothness. Thus, the far north cannot support iceboating well, as the snow comes early and does not melt, and further south the freezing does not produce consistently safe ice.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[Sail boat]]\n* [[Sailing]]\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[Land sailing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Iceboats}}\n\n{{Application of wind energy}}\n{{Ice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ice Boat}}\n[[Category:Ice yachting]]\n[[Category:Sailboat types]]\n[[Category:Racing vehicles]]\n[[Category:Human-powered watercraft]]\n\n[[de:Eissegeln]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2012}}\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2010}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Dn nasva 0854.jpg|300px|thumb|An iceboat at the 2011 DN European Championships  in [[Nasva]], [[Estonia]]]]\nAn '''ice boat''' (often spelled as \"iceboat\") is a [[boat]] or purpose-built framework similar in functional design to a [[sail boat]] but fitted with [[skis]] or runners (skates) and designed to run over [[ice]] instead of through (liquid) [[water]].

On some boats, a \"side car\" can be fitted to take others along for a ride.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\nThe first iceboats were probably converted from canal vessels used in the [[Netherlands]], where due to the [[Little Ice Age]] - a cooler [[Climate change (general concept)|climatic period]] lasting from the [[15th century|15th]] to the [[19th century]] - the canals were typically covered with ice for up to 5 months a year. Due to the winters lasted for almost half a year, trade and the transport of goods through the canals could not stop, so ingenious merchants put their boats on skates with the help of a plank, thus making them usable even during wintertime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://icesailing.nl/|title=ijszeilvereniging \"De Robben\" uit Kaag|website=icesailing.nl|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nTraditional iceboats from before the late 19th century were used for transportation of goods and racing. These boats reached lengths of {{convert|30|to|50|ft|m}} and were sometimes transported between sites on rail cars. Ice sailing was first developed in Europe. \n\nIn America, it was done in several locations where the sport also continues today. Many active ice sailing clubs are thriving in the northern States and Canadian Provinces, including on the [[Hudson River]]; [[Long Island Sound]]; [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; [[Sandusky, Ohio]]; [[Gull Lake (Michigan)|Gull Lake, Michigan]]; [[Lake Muskegon]], [[Michigan]]; [[Geneva Lake]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]; Hamilton Bay, Ontario, Rondeau Bay, Ontario; [[Ghost Lake, Alberta]], [[Fort Peck Lake|Fort Peck Lake, Montana]] and on other venues as far south as Decatur and Springfield, Illinois. Some of the older large \"stern steerer\" iceboats can seat several in their \"baskets.\" Several of these boats are maintained and raced today. The Northwest Ice Yacht Association sponsors an annual [[regatta]] that includes classes for these boats. This annual regatta recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe first iceboat in America is attributed to Oliver Booth in 1790 at Poughkeepsie, NY.  This craft was a small triangular box with two runners affixed to the front and a steering runner at the rear.\n\nOne unique type of ice boat has its history in wide, stubby, scow-like vessels used in the 1800s, often for transportation across a mixed passage transitioning over sea-ice and open water. Wildly sailed by adjusting main and jib sail trim only, these boats had no rudder. Parallel rails were mounted on the bottom, like multiple sled runners. These early vessels (called an \"ice scooter\" or \"bay scooter\") were capable of simultaneously and daringly traversing both open water and jumping onto stretches of ice and were used primarily for winter [[transportation]] to and from lighthouses and for [[ice fishing]]. In 1869, one of the largest ice yachts ever was built for racing on the frozen [[Hudson River]], called the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''. That boat occasionally raced the railroad which ran alongside the Hudson.\n\nThe first iceboats were adaptations of regular sailing boats, with a wooden plank fastened cross-wise at the front having a fixed runner at each end, and a steering runner attached to the bottom of the rudder at the [[stern]] (back). These early ice sailing [[marine vessel|vessels]] led to the development of boats designed strictly for racing on ice. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''. This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into a very efficient aerodynamically clean machine. While the large stern-steerers could have up to {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of sail, the Skeeter class is limited to just {{convert|75|sqft|m2}} of sail.\n\nIn 1937, The [[Detroit News]] sponsored a new home-buildable ice boat design, which became the [[International DN]]. In 1968 Dick Slates of [[Pewaukee, Wisconsin]] designed and built the ''Nite'' with two wooden prototypes. The design was refined and fiberglass production began in 1970.\n\n==Modern designs==\n[[File:Ice yachters on Hudson River near Barrytown, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Ice yachters on [[Hudson River]] at [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown, NY]]|alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them. In the far right upper background a portion of a bridge is visible]]\nModern iceboats designs are generally supported by three skate blades called \"runners\" supporting a triangular or cross-shaped frame with the steering runner in front. Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails. Once the lateral force has been effectively countered by the runner edge, the remaining force of \"sail-lift\" vacuums the boat forward with significant power. That power increases as the speed of the boat increases, allowing the boat to go much faster than the wind. The only seeming limitations to iceboat speed are windage, friction, the camber of the sail shape, strength of construction, quality of the ice surface and the level of skill, athleticism and fearlessness of the sailor.<ref>An elementary introduction to the relevant physics can be found at the bottom of the page {{cite web |url=http://iceboat.org/faqiceboat.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309200937/http://www.iceboat.org/faqiceboat.html |archive-date=2011-03-09 |df= }}</ref> Iceboats can sail as close as 7 degrees off the apparent wind.<ref>See page 204 of {{cite book\n |last = Bethwaite\n |first = Frank\n |title = High Performance Sailing\n |publisher = Adlard Coles Nautical\n |year = 2007\n |isbn = 978-0-7136-6704-2}}</ref>\n\nModern designs of iceboats are very efficient, utilizing aerodynamic designs and low friction, and can achieve speeds as high as ten times the [[wind speed]] in good conditions.

The same reference reported clocking a DN 60 iceboat on a closed course over black ice on Green Bay, Wisconsin at {{convert|94|knots|km/h mph}}. The stern-steerer ''Debutaunte'', recently rebuilt, was timed over a measured mile at {{convert|124|knots|km/h mph}} on the ice of [[Lake Winnebago]], Wisconsin in 1938.\n\nBecause of the very high potential boat speeds, iceboat race courses are established around fixed marks which are to be rounded in a one-way route. The courses are deliberately set in a straight line [[upwind]] and [[downwind]], though the boats have to tack back and forth to advance through the course. This course configuration provides a measure of traffic safety between competitors. Also, by directing the iceboat straight upwind or straight downwind, the sailor can best control the sail and limit the aerodynamic force; these are the slowest directions of travel. Recorded racing speeds for an [[International DN]] in {{convert|9|knots|km/h mph}} winds are {{convert|26|knots|km/h mph}} upwind, and {{convert|35|knots|km/h mph}} downwind.<ref>Dill, Bob (2004-Feb): [http://www.ice.idniyra.org/articles/IceboatSailingPerformance.html \"Putting Numbers on Iceboat Sailing Performance\"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''idniyra.org'', retrieved on 2009-01-14</ref> A downwind speed of {{convert|49|knots|km/h mph}} was recorded at a World Championship in winds of just {{convert|13|to|15|knots|km/h mph}}.<ref name=Boat_Speed/>\n\nIceboats are not produced commercially on a wide scale, but remain largely the province of hobbyists and enthusiasts building with high quality wood and plywood and more exotic materials such as foam, carbon fiber, fiberglass and epoxy. There are no known governmental licensing or registration requirements. Several classes are organized and boats must conform to the designs and rules of the classes in order to race.\n\nIce boats may have [[Lateen#Modern small-boat lateen sails|Sunfish rig]]s, [[Bermuda rig]]s, [[gaff rig]]s (see image) and even [[kite rig]]s.<ref>http://www.instructables.com/id/Traditional-Polynesian-Ice-Canoe-Ice-Proa/</ref>\n\n==Classes==\nThe [[International DN]] class is the most popular class in both North America and Europe. It is a one-person wood boat twelve feet long with a cross \"plank\" eight feet long and carries a mast {{convert|16|ft|m}} high. Modern competitive DNs use flexible masts commonly made of composite materials. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20171227121944/https://ice.idniyra.org/ ice.idniyra.org] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20061205014651/http://icesailing.org/ icesailing.org]. As noted above, the DN 60 name came as a result of a request published in the late 1930s by the Detroit News newspaper for a design to build a relatively inexpensive one-person iceboat that showed excellent performance, yet could be quickly built and sailed easily. The high-performance, modern DN is a far cry in materials and construction from the original design selected by the Detroit News. Yet, many of its one-design features are exactly the same as the original boat, including the basic aerodynamic fuselage design, runner configurations and {{convert|60|sqft|m2}} of high-performance sail.\n\nThe IceOptimist<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idniyra.eu/juniors/|title=ICE OPTI and DN JUNIOR \u2013 IDNIYRA \u2013 Europe|website=idniyra.eu|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> is a youth iceboat class that uses the sails and the rig of the [[Optimist (dinghy)|International Optimist dinghy]]. The first design was built in [[Estonia]] in 1978, with a scaled down elements of a [[International DN|DN]]. In [[2002]], the class was registered under the guardianship of IDNIYRA Europe with the permission of IODA. World and European Championships are sailed each winter with a fleet of approx. 40 racers.\n\nThe Skeeter class is divided into sub-classes (A, B and C) all of which are limited to {{convert|75|sqft|m2}} of sail area. A class boats are single seat, have mast heights in excess of 26&nbsp;ft and include bubble boats and rumble seaters. These boats are the fastest skeeters around and are on the cutting edge of technology using carbon fiber in their construction. B class skeeters are two seat boats (side by side seating) with 23 to 25&nbsp;ft masts, examples of B skeeters are the eastern Yankee and western Boe-Craft skeeters (www.boecraft.com). C class skeeters are single seat and are limited to a mast height of 20&nbsp;ft 3in or less. Some one-design classes have evolved within the C Skeeter class as well. These include the Nite, Renegade and J14 (C class), which have a wide and enthusiastic following, and several locally popular classes at iceboating locations. The International Skeeter Association holds an annual regatta to bring all the classes together to race. The skeeters have a limited number of rules, including a requirement for a cloth sail, and some restrictions on mast profile. Modern \"A\" skeeters are the fastest boats on ice. Some have fully enclosed cockpits and mast heights up to {{convert|30|ft|m}}. The \"A\" class sail is measured at {{convert|72|sqft|m2}}, which is the area of the triangle between the ends of the [[boom (sailing)|boom]] and the top of the mast. The actual sail area is much larger, as the \"roach\" of the sail outside this triangle is unmeasured. Also, the wing-mast and large [[aerodynamic]] boom is also unmeasured.\n\n==Icy areas==\nIceboating's popularity is primarily limited to the northern continental United States and Europe, as few places elsewhere have ice thick enough to safely use the vessels for an extended duration. Despite the ephemeral nature of perfect racing conditions in which a steady not-too-cold breeze combines with a broad stretch of flawless black ice, [[regatta]]s are held regularly, including local, regional, continental and world championships. In the United States there are active regattas around the [[Great Lakes]], and [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] in [[New Hampshire]], to [[Lake Minnetonka]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and in [[Wisconsin]] at [[Pewaukee Lake]], [[Geneva Lake]], [[Lake Winnebago]] and the lakes surrounding [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], several lakes in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] and several Western lakes. All are within the \"ice belt\" of approximately 40\u00b0N latitude to 45\u00b0-50\u00b0N latitude where it gets cold enough to freeze water to several inches thick before snow covers them. There is an active group of sailors on the [[Chesapeake Bay]], where sail-able ice appears irregularly. Once a thick snow fall occurs, iceboaters must wait for the snow to melt completely then refreeze or travel to another lake/area. The preferred condition of [[Black ice (lakes)|\"black ice\"]] is smooth clear ice that has no snow and has frozen in a state of smoothness. Thus, the far north cannot support iceboating well, as the snow comes early and does not melt, and further south the freezing does not produce consistently safe ice.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[Sail boat]]\n* [[Sailing]]\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[Land sailing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Iceboats}}\n\n{{Application of wind energy}}\n{{Ice}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ice Boat}}\n[[Category:Ice yachting]]\n[[Category:Sailboat types]]\n[[Category:Racing vehicles]]\n[[Category:Human-powered watercraft]]\n\n[[de:Eissegeln]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:More dynamic image with context", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_boat"}

In a general business sense, logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet the requirements of customers or corporations. The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as food and other consumable items. The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow, [[Materials management|materials handling]], [[Production (economics)|production]], [[packaging]], [[inventory]], [[transportation]], [[warehousing]], and often [[security]].\n\nIn military science, logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy, since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless. Military logistics was already practiced in the [[ancient world]] and as the modern military has a significant need for logistics solutions, advanced implementations have been developed. In military logistics, logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed.\n\nLogistics management is the part of [[supply chain management]] and [[supply chain engineering]] that plans, implements, and [[Control (management)|controls]] the efficient, effective forward, and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and [[Consumption (economics)|point of consumption]] to meet customer's requirements. The complexity of logistics can be modeled, analyzed, visualized, and optimized by dedicated [[simulation software]]. The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in all logistics fields. A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician.\n\n[[File:Modern warehouse with pallet rack storage system.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Configuring and managing warehouses is a central concern for both [[business logistics]] and [[military logistics]].]][[File:Logistics Specialist aboard USS George H.W.

Managing a distribution center is seen, therefore, as pertaining to the realm of logistics since, while in theory, the products made by a factory are ready for consumption they still need to be moved along the distribution network according to some logic, and the distribution center aggregates and processes orders coming from different areas of the territory. That being said, from a modeling perspective, there are similarities between [[operations management]] and logistics, and companies sometimes use hybrid professionals, with for example a \"Director of Operations\" or a \"Logistics Officer\" working on similar problems. Furthermore, the term [[supply chain management]] originally refers to, among other issues, having an integrated vision of both production and logistics from point of origin to point of production.<ref>V. Misra, M.I. Kahn, U.K. Singh, Supply Chain Management Systems: Architecture, Design and Vision, North American Business Press 2010 http://www.na-businesspress.com/jsis/misraweb.pdf</ref> All these terms may suffer from [[semantic change]] as a side effect of advertising.\n\n== Logistics activities and fields ==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2019}}\n{{Textbook|section|date=January 2019}}\n'''Inbound logistics''' is one of the primary processes of logistics concentrating on purchasing and arranging the inbound movement of materials, parts, or unfinished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants, warehouses, or retail stores.\n\n'''Outbound logistics''' is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product and the related information flows from the end of the production line to the end-user.\n\nGiven the services performed by logisticians, the main fields of logistics can be broken down as follows:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Procurement logistics\n* Distribution logistics\n* After-sales logistics\n* Disposal logistics\n* [[Reverse logistics]]\n* [[Green logistics]]\n* Global logistics\n* Domestics logistics\n* Concierge service\n* [[Reliability, availability, and maintainability]]\n* Asset control logistics\n* Point-of-sale material logistics\n* Emergency logistics\n* Production logistics\n* Construction logistics\n* Capital project logistics\n* Digital logistics\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[File:Thermal-oxidizer-logistics.jpg|thumb|Loading of a [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] at the point of origin en route to a manufacturing plant]]\n\n'''Procurement logistics''' consists of activities such as [[market research]], requirements planning, make-or-buy decisions, supplier management, ordering, and order controlling. The targets in procurement logistics might be contradictory: maximizing efficiency by concentrating on core competences, outsourcing while maintaining the autonomy of the company, or minimizing procurement costs while maximizing security within the supply process.\n\n'''Advance Logistics''' consists of the activities required to set up or establish a plan for logistics activities to occur.\n\n'''Global [[Logistics]]'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prologis.com/global-logistics|title=Global Logistics|date=2017-09-29|website=Prologis|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> is technically the process of managing the 'flow' of goods through what is called a supply chain, from its place of production, to other parts of the world. This often requires an intermodal transport system, transport via ocean, air, rail, and truck. This is possibly one of the more time-consuming and complicated forms of logistics. \n\n'''Distribution logistics''' has, as main tasks, the delivery of the finished products to the customer. It consists of order processing, warehousing, and transportation. Distribution logistics is necessary because the time, place, and quantity of production differ with the time, place, and quantity of consumption.\n\n'''Disposal logistics''' has as its main function to reduce logistics cost(s) and enhance service(s) related to the disposal of waste produced during the operation of a business.\n\n'''Reverse logistics''' denotes all those operations related to the reuse of products and materials. The reverse logistics process includes the management and the sale of surpluses, as well as products being returned to vendors from buyers. Reverse logistics stands for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials. It is \"the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods and related information from the point of consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal. More precisely, reverse logistics is the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal. The opposite of reverse logistics is '''forward logistics'''.\"<!-- Needs citation -->\n\n'''Green Logistics''' describes all attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities. This includes all activities of the forward and reverse flows. This can be achieved through [[intermodal freight transport]], path optimization, vehicle saturation and [[city logistics]].\n\n'''RAM Logistics''' (see also [[Logistic engineering]]) combines both '''business logistics''' and '''military logistics''' since it is concerned with highly complicated technological systems for which [[Reliability (engineering)|Reliability]], [[Availability]] and [[Maintainability]] are essential, ex: [[weapon system]]s and military supercomputers.\n\n'''Asset Control Logistics''': companies in the retail channels, both organized retailers and suppliers, often deploy assets required for the display, preservation, promotion of their products. Some examples are refrigerators, stands, display monitors, seasonal equipment, poster stands & frames.\n\n[[File:RAF Delivers Aid to Flood Hit Pakistan MOD 45151688.jpg|thumb|left| A [[forklift]] truck loads a pallet of humanitarian aid to [[Pakistan]] on board a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] aircraft, following [[2010 Pakistan floods|devastating floods]] in the country in 2010.]]\n'''[[Humanitarian Logistics|Emergency logistics]]''' (or '''[[Humanitarian Logistics]]''') is a term used by the logistics, supply chain, and manufacturing industries to denote specific time-critical modes of transport used to move goods or objects rapidly in the event of an emergency.<ref name=\"Cozzolino\">Cozzolino Alessandra, Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management, In Humanitarian Logistics, Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2012</ref> The reason for enlisting emergency logistics services could be a production delay or anticipated production delay, or an urgent need for specialized equipment to prevent events such as aircraft being grounded (also known as \"[[aircraft on ground]]\"\u2014AOG), ships being delayed, or telecommunications failure. Humanitarian logistics involves governments, the military, [[Aid agency|aid agencies]], donors, non-governmental organizations and emergency logistics services are typically sourced from a specialist provider.<ref name=\"Cozzolino\" /><ref>L. Torre, I.S. Dolinskaya, K.R. Smilowitz, Disaster relief routing: Integrating research and practice Socio-Economic Planning Sciences vol46, March 2012</ref>\n\nThe term '''production logistics''' describes logistic processes within a value-adding system (ex: factory or a mine). Production logistics aims to ensure that each machine and workstation receives the right product in the right quantity and quality at the right time. The concern is with production, testing, transportation, storage, and supply. Production logistics can operate in existing as well as new plants: since manufacturing in an existing plant is a constantly changing process, machines are exchanged and new ones added, which gives the opportunity to improve the production logistics system accordingly.<ref>Nyhuis P., Wiendahi Hans-Peter, Fundamentals of Production Logistics, Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009</ref> Production logistics provides the means to achieve customer response and capital efficiency. Production logistics becomes more important with decreasing batch sizes. In many industries (e.g. [[Telecommunications industry|mobile phones]]), the short-term goal is a batch size of one, allowing even a single customer's demand to be fulfilled efficiently. [[Track and trace|Track and tracing]], which is an essential part of production logistics due to product safety and reliability issues, is also gaining importance, especially in the [[automotive industry|automotive]] and [[medical industry|medical]] industries.\n\n'''Construction Logistics''' has been employed by civilisations for thousands of years. As the various human civilizations tried to build the best possible works of construction for living and protection. Now construction logistics hasemerged as a vital part of construction. In the past few years, construction logistics has emerged as a different field of knowledge and study within the subject of supply chain management and logistics.\n\n== Military logistics ==\n{{Main|Military logistics}}\n[[File:A mule column of the 2nd Punjabi Regiment carries supplies to the front line, Burma, 1944.

[[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS) is a discipline used in military industries to ensure an easily supportable system with a robust customer service (logistic) concept at the lowest cost and in line with (often high) reliability, availability, maintainability, and other requirements, as defined for the project.\n\nIn [[military logistics]], [[Logistics Officer]]s manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed.\n\n[[Supply chain management]] in military logistics often deals with a number of variables in predicting cost, deterioration, [[consumables|consumption]], and future demand. The [[United States Armed Forces]]' categorical [[Classes of supply|supply classification]] was developed in such a way that categories of supply with similar consumption variables are grouped together for planning purposes. For instance, peacetime consumption of ammunition and fuel will be considerably lower than wartime consumption of these items, whereas other classes of supply such as subsistence and clothing have a relatively consistent consumption rate regardless of war or peace.\n\nSome classes of supply have a linear demand relationship: as more troops are added, more supply items are needed; or as more equipment is used, more fuel and ammunition are consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third variable besides usage and quantity: time. As equipment ages, more and more [[spare part|repair parts]] are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stay consistent. By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying them to future scenarios, the US Armed Forces can accurately supply troops with the items necessary at the precise moment they are needed.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.alu.army.mil/alog/issues/JulAug09/joint_analysistool.html |title = The Joint Logistics Analysis Tool|journal = Army Logistician|volume = 41|issue=4|date = July\u2013August 2009|first1= Peter J.|last1= Cloutier|first2= Brian K.|last2= Frank}}</ref> History has shown that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force.

A., Military Logistics: Insights for Business Logistics, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management Vol 22, 1992</ref> due to the increasing complexity of supplying businesses with materials and shipping out products in an increasingly globalized supply chain, leading to a call for professionals called \"supply chain logisticians\".\n\nIn business, logistics may have either an internal focus (inbound logistics) or an external focus (outbound logistics), covering the flow and storage of materials from point of origin to point of consumption (see [[supply-chain management]]). The main functions of a qualified logistician include [[inventory management]], [[purchasing]], transportation, [[warehousing]], consultation, and the organizing and [[planning]] of these activities. Logisticians combine professional knowledge of each of these functions to coordinate resources in an organization.\n\nThere are two fundamentally different forms of logistics: one optimizes a steady flow of material through a network of transport links and storage nodes, while the other coordinates a [[sequence]] of resources to carry out some [[project]] (e.g., restructuring a warehouse).\n\n=== Nodes of a distribution network ===\nThe nodes of a distribution network include:\n* Factories where products are manufactured or assembled\n* A [[depot]] or deposit, a standard type of warehouse for storing merchandise (high level of inventory)\n* [[Distribution centers]] for [[order processing]] and [[order fulfillment]] (lower level of inventory) and also for receiving returning items from clients\n* Transit points for [[cross docking]] activities, which consist of reassembling cargo units based on deliveries scheduled (only moving merchandise)\n* Traditional retail stores of the [[Mom and Pop]] variety, modern supermarkets, [[hypermarkets]], [[discount store]]s or also voluntary chains, [[consumers' co-operative]], groups of consumer with [[collective buying power]]. Note that [[subsidiaries]] will be mostly owned by another company and [[franchisers]], although using other company brands, actually own the point of sale.\n\nThere may be some [[intermediaries]] operating for representative matters between nodes such as [[sales agents]] or brokers.\n\n=== Logistic families and metrics ===\nA logistic family is a set of products that share a common characteristic: weight and volumetric characteristics, physical storing needs (temperature, radiation,...), handling needs, order frequency, package size, etc. The following metrics may be used by the company to organize its products in different families:<ref name=\"RuPe\">{{cite book|first1=R.|last1= Ruggeri|first2= A. |last2=Perego|title= Esercitazioni e Temi d'esame di Logistica Industriale |publisher= CUSL |date=2001|language = Italian|isbn = 8881320150}}</ref>\n* Physical metrics used to evaluate inventory systems include stocking capacity, selectivity, superficial use, volumetric use, transport capacity, transport capacity use.\n* Monetary metrics used include space holding costs (building, shelving, and services) and handling costs (people, handling machinery, energy, and maintenance).\n\nOther metrics may present themselves in both physical or monetary form, such as the standard [[Inventory turnover]].\n\n=== Handling and order processing ===\n[[File:Unit Load Device 003.JPG|thumb|right|[[Unit load]]s for transportation of luggage at the airport. In this case, the unit load has a protective function.]]\n[[Unit loads]] are combinations of individual items which are moved by handling systems, usually employing a [[pallet]] of normed dimensions.<ref>{{cite ISO standard|csnumber=30524|title=ISO 6780:2003 \u2013 Flat pallets for intercontinental materials handling \u2013 Principal dimensions and tolerances}}</ref>\n\nHandling systems include: trans-pallet handlers, counterweight handler, retractable mast handler, bilateral handlers, trilateral handlers, [[Automated Guided Vehicle|AGV]] and other handlers.\n\nStorage systems include: pile stocking, cell [[Pallet racking|racks]] (either static or movable), cantilever racks and gravity racks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Lambert D., Stock J., Ellram L., Fundamentals of Logistics, McGraw-Hill 1998</ref>\n\n[[Order processing]] is a sequential process involving: processing withdrawal list, picking (selective removal of items from loading units), sorting (assembling items based on the destination), package formation (weighting, labeling, and packing), order consolidation (gathering packages into loading units for transportation, control and [[bill of lading]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">D.F. Bozutti, M.A. Bueno-Da-Costa, R. Ruggeri, Log\u00edstica: Vis\u00e3o Global e Picking, EdUFSCar 2010</ref>\n\n[[Order picking|Picking]] can be both manual or automated. Manual picking can be both man to goods, i.e. operator using a cart or conveyor belt, or goods to man, i.e. the operator benefiting from the presence of a mini-load [[Automated storage and retrieval system|ASRS]], vertical or [[horizontal carousel]] or from an Automatic Vertical Storage System (AVSS). Automatic picking is done either with [[Order picking#Technologies|dispensers]] or depalletizing robots.\n\n[[Sorting#Physical sorting processes|Sorting]] can be done manually through carts or conveyor belts, or automatically through [[Tilt Tray Sorter|sorters]].\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Cargo}}\nCargo, i.e. merchandise being transported, can be moved through a variety of transportation means and is organized in different [[shipment categories]]. [[Unit loads]] are usually assembled into higher standardized units such as: [[ISO containers]], [[swap bodies]] or [[semi-trailers]]. Especially for very long distances, product transportation will likely benefit from using different transportation means: [[multimodal transport]], [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal transport]] (no handling) and [[combined transport]] (minimal road transport). When moving cargo, typical constraints are maximum weight and [[volume]].\n\nOperators involved in transportation include: all train, road vehicles, boats, airplanes companies, [[couriers]], [[freight forwarders]] and [[multi-modal transport operators]].\n\nMerchandise being transported internationally is usually subject to the [[Incoterms]] standards issued by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]].\n\n=== Configuration and management ===\n[[File:Push-Back-Rack.jpg|thumb|left|Push-back rack for motorcycles, a [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|LIFO]] rack system for storage]]\nSimilarly to production systems, logistic systems need to be properly configured and managed. Actually a number of methodologies have been directly borrowed from [[operations management]] such as using [[Economic Order Quantity]] models for managing inventory in the nodes of the network.<ref>Waters D., Logistics: An Introduction to Supply Chain Management, Palgrave Macmillan 2003</ref> [[Distribution resource planning]] (DRP) is similar to [[Material requirements planning|MRP]], except that it doesn't concern activities inside the nodes of the network but planning distribution when moving goods through the links of the network.\n\nTraditionally in logistics '''configuration''' may be at the level of the warehouse ([[node (graph theory)|node]]) or at level of the distribution system ([[Flow network|network]]).\n\nRegarding a single warehouse, besides the issue of designing and building the warehouse, configuration means solving a number of interrelated technical-economic problems: dimensioning [[Pallet racking|rack]] cells, choosing a [[Palletizer|palletizing]] method (manual or through [[robots]]), rack dimensioning and design, number of racks, number and typology of retrieval systems (e.g. [[Crane (machine)#Stacker crane|stacker cranes]]). Some important constraints have to be satisfied: fork and load beams resistance to [[bending]] and proper placement of [[fire sprinkler|sprinklers]]. Although [[Order picking|picking]] is more of a tactical planning decision than a configuration problem, it is important to take it into account when deciding the layout of the racks inside the warehouse and buying tools such as handlers and motorized carts since once those decisions are taken they will work as constraints when managing the warehouse, the same reasoning for [[Sorting#Physical sorting processes|sorting]] when designing the conveyor system or installing automatic [[Order picking#Technologies|dispensers]].\n\nConfiguration at the level of the distribution system concerns primarily the problem of [[location (geography)|location]] of the nodes in geographic space and distribution of [[Productive capacity|capacity]] among the nodes. The first may be referred to as [[facility location]] (with the special case of [[site selection]]) while the latter to as capacity allocation. The problem of outsourcing typically arises at this level: the nodes of a [[supply chain]] are very rarely owned by a single enterprise. Distribution networks can be characterized by numbers of levels, namely the number of intermediary nodes between [[Vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] and consumer:\n* [[Direct store delivery]], i.e. zero levels\n* One level network: central warehouse\n* Two level network: central and peripheral warehouses\n\nThis distinction is more useful for modeling purposes, but it relates also to a tactical decision regarding [[safety stocks]]: considering a two-level network, if safety inventory is kept only in peripheral warehouses then it is called a dependent system (from suppliers), if safety inventory is distributed among central and peripheral warehouses it is called an independent system (from suppliers).<ref name=\"Rupe\" /> Transportation from producer to the second level is called primary transportation, from the second level to a consumer is called secondary transportation.\n\nAlthough configuring a distribution network from zero is possible, logisticians usually have to deal with restructuring existing networks due to presence of an array of factors: changing demand, product or process innovation, opportunities for outsourcing, change of government policy toward [[trade barriers]], innovation in transportation means (both [[vehicles]] or [[thoroughfares]]), the introduction of [[regulations]] (notably those regarding pollution) and availability of ICT supporting systems (e.g. [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] or [[e-commerce]]).\n\nOnce a logistic system is configured, '''management''', meaning tactical decisions, takes place, once again, at the level of the warehouse and of the distribution network. Decisions have to be made under a set of [[constraint (mathematics)|constraints]]: internal, such as using the available infrastructure, or external, such as complying with the given product [[shelf life]]s and [[Shelf life|expiration dates]].\n\nAt the warehouse level, the logistician must decide how to distribute merchandise over the racks. Three basic situations are traditionally considered: shared storage, dedicated storage (rack space reserved for specific merchandise) and class-based storage (class meaning merchandise organized in different areas according to their access index).\n[[File:Airline hub-1995.svg|thumb|300px|right|Airline logistic network. [[Denver]] works as a [[hub and spoke|hub]] in the network.]]\n\n[[Order picking|Picking]] efficiency varies greatly depending on the situation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> For a man to goods situation, a distinction is carried out between high-level picking (vertical component significant) and low-level picking (vertical component insignificant). A number of tactical decisions regarding picking must be made:\n* Routing path: standard alternatives include transversal routing, return routing, midpoint routing, and largest gap return routing\n* Replenishment method: standard alternatives include equal space supply for each product class and equal time supply for each product class.\n* Picking logic: order picking vs batch picking\n\nAt the level of the distribution network, tactical decisions involve mainly [[inventory control]] and [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] path optimization. Note that the logistician may be required to manage the [[reverse logistics|reverse flow]] along with the forward flow.\n\n=== Warehouse management system and control ===\n\nAlthough there is some overlap in functionality, [[warehouse management system]]s (WMS) can differ significantly from [[warehouse control system]]s (WCS). Simply put, a WMS plans a weekly activity forecast based on such factors as statistics and [[Trend estimation|trends]], whereas a WCS acts like a floor supervisor, working in real-time to get the job done by the most effective means. For instance, a WMS can tell the system that it is going to need five of [[stock-keeping unit]] (SKU) A and five of SKU B hours in advance, but by the time it acts, other considerations may have come into play or there could be a logjam on a conveyor. A WCS can prevent that problem by working in real-time and adapting to the situation by making a last-minute decision based on current activity and operational status. Working [[synergistically]], WMS and WCS can resolve these issues and maximize [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] for companies that rely on the effective operation of their warehouse or distribution center.<ref name=\"sdcexec\">{{cite web\n|author=John T.

For example, if a company with its own warehousing facilities decides to employ external transportation, this would be an example of third-party logistics. Logistics is an emerging business area in many countries.\n\nThe concept of a '''fourth-party logistics''' (4PL) provider was first defined by Andersen Consulting (now [[Accenture]]) as an integrator that assembles the resources, planning capabilities, and technology of its own organization and other organizations to design, build, and run comprehensive supply chain solutions. Whereas a third-party logistics (3PL) service provider targets a single function, a 4PL targets management of the entire process. Some have described a 4PL as a general contractor that manages other 3PLs, truckers, forwarders, custom house agents, and others, essentially taking responsibility of a complete process for the customer.\n\n=== Horizontal alliances between logistics service providers ===\n\nHorizontal [[business alliance]]s often occur between logistics service providers, i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing.<ref name=\"rauewieland\">Raue, J.S. & Wieland, A.

On one hand, they can \" resources which are directly exploitable\". In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can \"access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable\". This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.<ref name=\"rauewieland\" />\n\n== Logistics automation ==\n{{Main|Logistics automation}}\n[[File:Automated Storage and Retrieval System - Defense Visual Information Center \u00b7 DD-ST-96-00253.JPEG|thumb|200px|[[Automated storage and retrieval system]] used by the U.S. military, also used by business in conjunction with manual picking.]]\n\n[[Logistics automation]] is the application of computer software or [[Automation|automated]] machinery to improve the efficiency of logistics operations. Typically this refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center with broader tasks undertaken by [[supply chain engineering]] systems and [[enterprise resource planning]] systems.\n\nIndustrial machinery can typically identify products through either [[barcode]] or [[RFID]] technologies. Information in traditional bar codes is stored as a sequence of black and white bars varying in width, which when read by laser is translated into a digital sequence, which according to fixed rules can be converted into a decimal number or other data. Sometimes information in a bar code can be transmitted through radio frequency, more typically radio transmission is used in RFID tags. An RFID tag is a card containing a memory chip and an antenna that transmits signals to a reader. RFID may be found on merchandise, animals, vehicles, and people as well.\n\n== Logistics: profession and organizations ==\nA '''logistician''' is a professional logistics practitioner. Professional logisticians are often certified by professional associations. One can either work in a pure logistics company, such as a shipping line, airport, or [[freight forwarder]], or within the logistics department of a company. However, as mentioned above, logistics is a broad field, encompassing procurement, production, distribution, and disposal activities. Hence, career perspectives are broad as well.\nA new trend in the industry is the 4PL, or fourth-party logistics, firms, consulting companies offering logistics services.\n\nSome universities and academic institutions train students as logisticians, offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs. A university with a primary focus on logistics is [[K\u00fchne Logistics University]] in Hamburg, Germany. It is non-profit and supported by K\u00fchne-Foundation of the logistics entrepreneur [[Klaus Michael K\u00fchne]].\n\nThe [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]] (CILT), established in the United Kingdom in 1919, received a [[Royal Charter]] in 1926. The Chartered Institute is one of the [[professional bodies]] or institutions for the logistics and transport sectors that offer [[professional qualification]]s or degrees in logistics management. CILT programs can be studied at centers around the UK, some of which also offer distance learning options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/england-shipping-logistics-professional-certifications/chartered-institute-of-logistics-and-transport|title=Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) \u2013 Professional Logistics Programs|website=EduMaritime}}</ref> The institute also have overseas branches namely The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Australia (CILTA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/queensland/chartered-institute-of-logistics-transport-australia|title=Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Australia (CILTA) \u2013 Certification & Training|website=EduMaritime}}</ref> in Australia and Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/hong-kong/chartered-institute-of-logistics-and-transport-in-hong-kong|title=Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK) \u2013 PQE Programs|website=EduMaritime}}</ref> in Hong Kong. In the UK, Logistics Management programs are conducted by many universities and professional bodies such as CILT. These programs are generally offered at the postgraduate level.\n\nThe [[Global Institute of Logistics]]<ref name=\"gil-home\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globeinst.org/|title=GIL HOME|website=Global Institute of Logistics|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> established in New York in 2003 is a [[Think tank]] for the profession and is primarily concerned with intercontinental maritime logistics. It is particularly concerned with [[Containerization|container]] logistics and the role of the [[Port authority|seaport authority]] in the maritime logistics chain. The Institute has developed a community of over 8,500 [[logistician]]s who act a global knowledge network committed to supporting the Institute's mission of contributing to the resolution of legacy challenges in global logistics. Challenges associated with the traditional approach of managing single transport modes, modal systems as stand-alone operations. The key to overcoming these legacy challenges is for the individual stakeholder groups within the logistics chain to actively engage with each other. The promotion of this agenda is the Institute's work.\n\nThe [[International Association of Public Health Logisticians]] (IAPHL)<ref name=\"iaphl\">{{Cite web|url=https://iaphl.org/|title=International Association of Public Health Logisiticians|website=IAPHL|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> is a professional network that promotes the professional development of supply chain managers and others working in the field of public health logistics and commodity security, with particular focus on developing countries. The association supports logisticians worldwide by providing a community of practice, where members can network, exchange ideas, and improve their professional skills. \n\n=== Logistics museums ===\nThere are many museums in the world which cover various aspects of practical logistics.

In a general business sense, logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet the requirements of customers or corporations. The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as food and other consumable items. The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow, [[Materials management|materials handling]], [[Production (economics)|production]], [[packaging]], [[inventory]], [[transportation]], [[warehousing]], and often [[security]].\n\nIn military science, logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy, since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless. Military logistics was already practiced in the [[ancient world]] and as the modern military has a significant need for logistics solutions, advanced implementations have been developed. In military logistics, logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed.\n\nLogistics management is the part of [[supply chain management]] and [[supply chain engineering]] that plans, implements, and [[Control (management)|controls]] the efficient, effective forward, and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and [[Consumption (economics)|point of consumption]] to meet customer's requirements. The complexity of logistics can be modeled, analyzed, visualized, and optimized by dedicated [[simulation software]]. The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in all logistics fields. A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician.\n\n[[File:Modern warehouse with pallet rack storage system.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Configuring and managing warehouses is a central concern for both [[business logistics]] and [[military logistics]].]][[File:Logistics Specialist aboard USS George H.W.

The term appears in the 1830 edition, then titled ''Analytic Table'' (''Tableau Analytique''),<ref name=\"Jomini1830\">{{cite book |title=Tableau Analytique des principales combinaisons De La Guerre, Et De Leurs Rapports Avec La Politique Des \u00c9tats: Pour Servir D'Introduction Au Trait\u00e9 Des Grandes Op\u00e9rations Militaires |author=Baron de Jomini |author-link=Antoine-Henri Jomini |year=1830 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ofAcWX9UsIUC&pg=PA74&q=logistique#v=onepage&q=logistique&f=false 74]}}</ref> and Jomini explains that it is derived from {{lang-fr|{{wikt-lang|fr|logis}}|lit=lodgings}} (cognate to English {{wikt-lang|en|lodge}}), in the terms {{lang-fr|[[mar\u00e9chal des logis]]|lit=marshall of lodgings}} and {{lang-fr|major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des logis|lit=major-general of lodging}}:\n{{quote|{{lang-fr|Autrefois les officiers de l\u2019\u00e9tat-major se nommaient: mar\u00e9chal des logis, major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des logis; de l\u00e0 est venu le terme de logistique, qu\u2019on emploie pour d\u00e9signer ce qui se rapporte aux marches d\u2019une arm\u00e9e.|label=none|italics=no}}\n\nFormerly the officers of the general staff were named: marshall of lodgings, major-general of lodgings; from there came the term of logistics [''logistique''], which we employ to designate those who are in charge of the functioning of an army.}}\n\nThe term is credited to Jomini, and the term and its etymology criticized by [[:fr:Georges de Chambray|Georges de Chambray]] in 1832, writing:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Observation sur Le Tableau Analytique des principales combinaisons De La Guerre, Et De Leurs Rapports Avec La Politique Des \u00c9tats: Pour Servir D'Introduction Au Trait\u00e9 Des Grandes Op\u00e9rations Militaires par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Jomini. |author-link=:fr:Georges de Chambray |author=Chambray |journal=Le Spectateur militaire: Recueil de science, d'art et d'histoire militaires |year=1832 |lang=fr|volume=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5s8AAAAYAAJ&dq=logistique&pg=PA19#v=onepage |page =19}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|{{lang-fr|italic=unset|''Logistique'': Ce mot me para\u00eet \u00eatre tout-\u00e0-fait nouveau, car je ne l'avais encore vu nulle part dans la litt\u00e9rature militaire. \u2026 il para\u00eet le faire d\u00e9river du mot ''logis'', \u00e9tymologie singuli\u00e8re \u2026|label=none}}\n\n''Logistic'': This word appears to me to be completely new, as I have not yet seen it anywhere in military literature. \u2026 he appears to derive it from the word ''lodgings'' [''logis''], a peculiar etymology \u2026}}\nChambray also notes that the term {{lang-fr|label=none|logistique}} was present in the ''{{w|Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise}}'' as a synonym for [[algebra]].\n\nThe {{lang-fr|logistique|label=French word}} is a [[homonym]] of the existing mathematical term, from {{lang-grc|\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u1fd0\u03c3\u03c4\u1fd0\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2|logistik\u00f3s}}, a traditional division of [[Greek mathematics]]; the mathematical term is presumably the origin of the term ''logistic'' in [[logistic growth]] and related terms.

However, the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' defines logistics as \"the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people, facilities, or supplies\", and the Oxford Dictionary on-line defines it as \"the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation\".<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/logistics?q=logistics Oxford Dictionaries].

Managing a distribution center is seen, therefore, as pertaining to the realm of logistics since, while in theory, the products made by a factory are ready for consumption they still need to be moved along the distribution network according to some logic, and the distribution center aggregates and processes orders coming from different areas of the territory. That being said, from a modeling perspective, there are similarities between [[operations management]] and logistics, and companies sometimes use hybrid professionals, with for example a \"Director of Operations\" or a \"Logistics Officer\" working on similar problems. Furthermore, the term [[supply chain management]] originally refers to, among other issues, having an integrated vision of both production and logistics from point of origin to point of production.<ref>V. Misra, M.I. Kahn, U.K. Singh, Supply Chain Management Systems: Architecture, Design and Vision, North American Business Press 2010 http://www.na-businesspress.com/jsis/misraweb.pdf</ref> All these terms may suffer from [[semantic change]] as a side effect of advertising.\n\n== Logistics activities and fields ==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2019}}\n{{Textbook|section|date=January 2019}}\n'''Inbound logistics''' is one of the primary processes of logistics concentrating on purchasing and arranging the inbound movement of materials, parts, or unfinished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants, warehouses, or retail stores.\n\n'''Outbound logistics''' is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product and the related information flows from the end of the production line to the end-user.\n\nGiven the services performed by logisticians, the main fields of logistics can be broken down as follows:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Procurement logistics\n* Distribution logistics\n* After-sales logistics\n* Disposal logistics\n* [[Reverse logistics]]\n* [[Green logistics]]\n* Global logistics\n* Domestics logistics\n* Concierge service\n* [[Reliability, availability, and maintainability]]\n* Asset control logistics\n* Point-of-sale material logistics\n* Emergency logistics\n* Production logistics\n* Construction logistics\n* Capital project logistics\n* Digital logistics\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[File:Thermal-oxidizer-logistics.jpg|thumb|Loading of a [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] at the point of origin en route to a manufacturing plant]]\n\n'''Procurement logistics''' consists of activities such as [[market research]], requirements planning, make-or-buy decisions, supplier management, ordering, and order controlling. The targets in procurement logistics might be contradictory: maximizing efficiency by concentrating on core competences, outsourcing while maintaining the autonomy of the company, or minimizing procurement costs while maximizing security within the supply process.\n\n'''Advance Logistics''' consists of the activities required to set up or establish a plan for logistics activities to occur.\n\n'''Global [[Logistics]]'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prologis.com/global-logistics|title=Global Logistics|date=2017-09-29|website=Prologis|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> is technically the process of managing the 'flow' of goods through what is called a supply chain, from its place of production, to other parts of the world. This often requires an intermodal transport system, transport via ocean, air, rail, and truck. This is possibly one of the more time-consuming and complicated forms of logistics. \n\n'''Distribution logistics''' has, as main tasks, the delivery of the finished products to the customer. It consists of order processing, warehousing, and transportation. Distribution logistics is necessary because the time, place, and quantity of production differ with the time, place, and quantity of consumption.\n\n'''Disposal logistics''' has as its main function to reduce logistics cost(s) and enhance service(s) related to the disposal of waste produced during the operation of a business.\n\n'''Reverse logistics''' denotes all those operations related to the reuse of products and materials. The reverse logistics process includes the management and the sale of surpluses, as well as products being returned to vendors from buyers. Reverse logistics stands for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials. It is \"the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods and related information from the point of consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal. More precisely, reverse logistics is the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal. The opposite of reverse logistics is '''forward logistics'''.\"<!-- Needs citation -->\n\n'''Green Logistics''' describes all attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities. This includes all activities of the forward and reverse flows. This can be achieved through [[intermodal freight transport]], path optimization, vehicle saturation and [[city logistics]].\n\n'''RAM Logistics''' (see also [[Logistic engineering]]) combines both '''business logistics''' and '''military logistics''' since it is concerned with highly complicated technological systems for which [[Reliability (engineering)|Reliability]], [[Availability]] and [[Maintainability]] are essential, ex: [[weapon system]]s and military supercomputers.\n\n'''Asset Control Logistics''': companies in the retail channels, both organized retailers and suppliers, often deploy assets required for the display, preservation, promotion of their products. Some examples are refrigerators, stands, display monitors, seasonal equipment, poster stands & frames.\n\n[[File:RAF Delivers Aid to Flood Hit Pakistan MOD 45151688.jpg|thumb|left| A [[forklift]] truck loads a pallet of humanitarian aid to [[Pakistan]] on board a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] aircraft, following [[2010 Pakistan floods|devastating floods]] in the country in 2010.]]\n'''[[Humanitarian Logistics|Emergency logistics]]''' (or '''[[Humanitarian Logistics]]''') is a term used by the logistics, supply chain, and manufacturing industries to denote specific time-critical modes of transport used to move goods or objects rapidly in the event of an emergency.<ref name=\"Cozzolino\">Cozzolino Alessandra, Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management, In Humanitarian Logistics, Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2012</ref> The reason for enlisting emergency logistics services could be a production delay or anticipated production delay, or an urgent need for specialized equipment to prevent events such as aircraft being grounded (also known as \"[[aircraft on ground]]\"\u2014AOG), ships being delayed, or telecommunications failure.

Torre, I.S. Dolinskaya, K.R. Smilowitz, Disaster relief routing: Integrating research and practice Socio-Economic Planning Sciences vol46, March 2012</ref>\n\nThe term '''production logistics''' describes logistic processes within a value-adding system (ex: factory or a mine). Production logistics aims to ensure that each machine and workstation receives the right product in the right quantity and quality at the right time. The concern is with production, testing, transportation, storage, and supply. Production logistics can operate in existing as well as new plants: since manufacturing in an existing plant is a constantly changing process, machines are exchanged and new ones added, which gives the opportunity to improve the production logistics system accordingly.<ref>Nyhuis P., Wiendahi Hans-Peter, Fundamentals of Production Logistics, Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2009</ref> Production logistics provides the means to achieve customer response and capital efficiency. Production logistics becomes more important with decreasing batch sizes. In many industries (e.g. [[Telecommunications industry|mobile phones]]), the short-term goal is a batch size of one, allowing even a single customer's demand to be fulfilled efficiently. [[Track and trace|Track and tracing]], which is an essential part of production logistics due to product safety and reliability issues, is also gaining importance, especially in the [[automotive industry|automotive]] and [[medical industry|medical]] industries.\n\n'''Construction Logistics''' has been employed by civilisations for thousands of years. As the various human civilizations tried to build the best possible works of construction for living and protection. Now the construction logistics emerged as a vital part of the construction. In the past few years, construction logistics has emerged as a different field of knowledge and study within the subject of supply chain management and logistics.\n\n== Military logistics ==\n{{Main|Military logistics}}\n[[File:A mule column of the 2nd Punjabi Regiment carries supplies to the front line, Burma, 1944.

[[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS) is a discipline used in military industries to ensure an easily supportable system with a robust customer service (logistic) concept at the lowest cost and in line with (often high) reliability, availability, maintainability, and other requirements, as defined for the project.\n\nIn [[military logistics]], [[Logistics Officer]]s manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed.\n\n[[Supply chain management]] in military logistics often deals with a number of variables in predicting cost, deterioration, [[consumables|consumption]], and future demand. The [[United States Armed Forces]]' categorical [[Classes of supply|supply classification]] was developed in such a way that categories of supply with similar consumption variables are grouped together for planning purposes. For instance, peacetime consumption of ammunition and fuel will be considerably lower than wartime consumption of these items, whereas other classes of supply such as subsistence and clothing have a relatively consistent consumption rate regardless of war or peace.\n\nSome classes of supply have a linear demand relationship: as more troops are added, more supply items are needed; or as more equipment is used, more fuel and ammunition are consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third variable besides usage and quantity: time. As equipment ages, more and more [[spare part|repair parts]] are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stay consistent. By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying them to future scenarios, the US Armed Forces can accurately supply troops with the items necessary at the precise moment they are needed.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.alu.army.mil/alog/issues/JulAug09/joint_analysistool.html |title = The Joint Logistics Analysis Tool|journal = Army Logistician|volume = 41|issue=4|date = July\u2013August 2009|first1= Peter J.|last1= Cloutier|first2= Brian K.|last2= Frank}}</ref> History has shown that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force.

A., Military Logistics: Insights for Business Logistics, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management Vol 22, 1992</ref> due to the increasing complexity of supplying businesses with materials and shipping out products in an increasingly globalized supply chain, leading to a call for professionals called \"supply chain logisticians\".\n\nIn business, logistics may have either an internal focus (inbound logistics) or an external focus (outbound logistics), covering the flow and storage of materials from point of origin to point of consumption (see [[supply-chain management]]). The main functions of a qualified logistician include [[inventory management]], [[purchasing]], transportation, [[warehousing]], consultation, and the organizing and [[planning]] of these activities. Logisticians combine professional knowledge of each of these functions to coordinate resources in an organization.\n\nThere are two fundamentally different forms of logistics: one optimizes a steady flow of material through a network of transport links and storage nodes, while the other coordinates a [[sequence]] of resources to carry out some [[project]] (e.g., restructuring a warehouse).\n\n=== Nodes of a distribution network ===\nThe nodes of a distribution network include:\n* Factories where products are manufactured or assembled\n* A [[depot]] or deposit, a standard type of warehouse for storing merchandise (high level of inventory)\n* [[Distribution centers]] for [[order processing]] and [[order fulfillment]] (lower level of inventory) and also for receiving returning items from clients\n* Transit points for [[cross docking]] activities, which consist of reassembling cargo units based on deliveries scheduled (only moving merchandise)\n* Traditional retail stores of the [[Mom and Pop]] variety, modern supermarkets, [[hypermarkets]], [[discount store]]s or also voluntary chains, [[consumers' co-operative]], groups of consumer with [[collective buying power]]. Note that [[subsidiaries]] will be mostly owned by another company and [[franchisers]], although using other company brands, actually own the point of sale.\n\nThere may be some [[intermediaries]] operating for representative matters between nodes such as [[sales agents]] or brokers.\n\n=== Logistic families and metrics ===\nA logistic family is a set of products that share a common characteristic: weight and volumetric characteristics, physical storing needs (temperature, radiation,...), handling needs, order frequency, package size, etc. The following metrics may be used by the company to organize its products in different families:<ref name=\"RuPe\">{{cite book|first1=R.|last1= Ruggeri|first2= A. |last2=Perego|title= Esercitazioni e Temi d'esame di Logistica Industriale |publisher= CUSL |date=2001|language = Italian|isbn = 8881320150}}</ref>\n* Physical metrics used to evaluate inventory systems include stocking capacity, selectivity, superficial use, volumetric use, transport capacity, transport capacity use.\n* Monetary metrics used include space holding costs (building, shelving, and services) and handling costs (people, handling machinery, energy, and maintenance).\n\nOther metrics may present themselves in both physical or monetary form, such as the standard [[Inventory turnover]].\n\n=== Handling and order processing ===\n[[File:Unit Load Device 003.JPG|thumb|right|[[Unit load]]s for transportation of luggage at the airport. In this case, the unit load has a protective function.]]\n[[Unit loads]] are combinations of individual items which are moved by handling systems, usually employing a [[pallet]] of normed dimensions.<ref>{{cite ISO standard|csnumber=30524|title=ISO 6780:2003 \u2013 Flat pallets for intercontinental materials handling \u2013 Principal dimensions and tolerances}}</ref>\n\nHandling systems include: trans-pallet handlers, counterweight handler, retractable mast handler, bilateral handlers, trilateral handlers, [[Automated Guided Vehicle|AGV]] and other handlers.\n\nStorage systems include: pile stocking, cell [[Pallet racking|racks]] (either static or movable), cantilever racks and gravity racks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Lambert D., Stock J., Ellram L., Fundamentals of Logistics, McGraw-Hill 1998</ref>\n\n[[Order processing]] is a sequential process involving: processing withdrawal list, picking (selective removal of items from loading units), sorting (assembling items based on the destination), package formation (weighting, labeling, and packing), order consolidation (gathering packages into loading units for transportation, control and [[bill of lading]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">D.F. Bozutti, M.A. Bueno-Da-Costa, R. Ruggeri, Log\u00edstica: Vis\u00e3o Global e Picking, EdUFSCar 2010</ref>\n\n[[Order picking|Picking]] can be both manual or automated. Manual picking can be both man to goods, i.e. operator using a cart or conveyor belt, or goods to man, i.e. the operator benefiting from the presence of a mini-load [[Automated storage and retrieval system|ASRS]], vertical or [[horizontal carousel]] or from an Automatic Vertical Storage System (AVSS). Automatic picking is done either with [[Order picking#Technologies|dispensers]] or depalletizing robots.\n\n[[Sorting#Physical sorting processes|Sorting]] can be done manually through carts or conveyor belts, or automatically through [[Tilt Tray Sorter|sorters]].\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Cargo}}\nCargo, i.e. merchandise being transported, can be moved through a variety of transportation means and is organized in different [[shipment categories]]. [[Unit loads]] are usually assembled into higher standardized units such as: [[ISO containers]], [[swap bodies]] or [[semi-trailers]]. Especially for very long distances, product transportation will likely benefit from using different transportation means: [[multimodal transport]], [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal transport]] (no handling) and [[combined transport]] (minimal road transport). When moving cargo, typical constraints are maximum weight and [[volume]].\n\nOperators involved in transportation include: all train, road vehicles, boats, airplanes companies, [[couriers]], [[freight forwarders]] and [[multi-modal transport operators]].\n\nMerchandise being transported internationally is usually subject to the [[Incoterms]] standards issued by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]].\n\n=== Configuration and management ===\n[[File:Push-Back-Rack.jpg|thumb|left|Push-back rack for motorcycles, a [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|LIFO]] rack system for storage]]\nSimilarly to production systems, logistic systems need to be properly configured and managed. Actually a number of methodologies have been directly borrowed from [[operations management]] such as using [[Economic Order Quantity]] models for managing inventory in the nodes of the network.<ref>Waters D., Logistics: An Introduction to Supply Chain Management, Palgrave Macmillan 2003</ref> [[Distribution resource planning]] (DRP) is similar to [[Material requirements planning|MRP]], except that it doesn't concern activities inside the nodes of the network but planning distribution when moving goods through the links of the network.\n\nTraditionally in logistics '''configuration''' may be at the level of the warehouse ([[node (graph theory)|node]]) or at level of the distribution system ([[Flow network|network]]).\n\nRegarding a single warehouse, besides the issue of designing and building the warehouse, configuration means solving a number of interrelated technical-economic problems: dimensioning [[Pallet racking|rack]] cells, choosing a [[Palletizer|palletizing]] method (manual or through [[robots]]), rack dimensioning and design, number of racks, number and typology of retrieval systems (e.g. [[Crane (machine)#Stacker crane|stacker cranes]]). Some important constraints have to be satisfied: fork and load beams resistance to [[bending]] and proper placement of [[fire sprinkler|sprinklers]]. Although [[Order picking|picking]] is more of a tactical planning decision than a configuration problem, it is important to take it into account when deciding the layout of the racks inside the warehouse and buying tools such as handlers and motorized carts since once those decisions are taken they will work as constraints when managing the warehouse, the same reasoning for [[Sorting#Physical sorting processes|sorting]] when designing the conveyor system or installing automatic [[Order picking#Technologies|dispensers]].\n\nConfiguration at the level of the distribution system concerns primarily the problem of [[location (geography)|location]] of the nodes in geographic space and distribution of [[Productive capacity|capacity]] among the nodes. The first may be referred to as [[facility location]] (with the special case of [[site selection]]) while the latter to as capacity allocation. The problem of outsourcing typically arises at this level: the nodes of a [[supply chain]] are very rarely owned by a single enterprise. Distribution networks can be characterized by numbers of levels, namely the number of intermediary nodes between [[Vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] and consumer:\n* [[Direct store delivery]], i.e. zero levels\n* One level network: central warehouse\n* Two level network: central and peripheral warehouses\n\nThis distinction is more useful for modeling purposes, but it relates also to a tactical decision regarding [[safety stocks]]: considering a two-level network, if safety inventory is kept only in peripheral warehouses then it is called a dependent system (from suppliers), if safety inventory is distributed among central and peripheral warehouses it is called an independent system (from suppliers).<ref name=\"Rupe\" /> Transportation from producer to the second level is called primary transportation, from the second level to a consumer is called secondary transportation.\n\nAlthough configuring a distribution network from zero is possible, logisticians usually have to deal with restructuring existing networks due to presence of an array of factors: changing demand, product or process innovation, opportunities for outsourcing, change of government policy toward [[trade barriers]], innovation in transportation means (both [[vehicles]] or [[thoroughfares]]), the introduction of [[regulations]] (notably those regarding pollution) and availability of ICT supporting systems (e.g. [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] or [[e-commerce]]).\n\nOnce a logistic system is configured, '''management''', meaning tactical decisions, takes place, once again, at the level of the warehouse and of the distribution network. Decisions have to be made under a set of [[constraint (mathematics)|constraints]]: internal, such as using the available infrastructure, or external, such as complying with the given product [[shelf life]]s and [[Shelf life|expiration dates]].\n\nAt the warehouse level, the logistician must decide how to distribute merchandise over the racks. Three basic situations are traditionally considered: shared storage, dedicated storage (rack space reserved for specific merchandise) and class-based storage (class meaning merchandise organized in different areas according to their access index).\n[[File:Airline hub-1995.svg|thumb|300px|right|Airline logistic network. [[Denver]] works as a [[hub and spoke|hub]] in the network.]]\n\n[[Order picking|Picking]] efficiency varies greatly depending on the situation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> For a man to goods situation, a distinction is carried out between high-level picking (vertical component significant) and low-level picking (vertical component insignificant). A number of tactical decisions regarding picking must be made:\n* Routing path: standard alternatives include transversal routing, return routing, midpoint routing, and largest gap return routing\n* Replenishment method: standard alternatives include equal space supply for each product class and equal time supply for each product class.\n* Picking logic: order picking vs batch picking\n\nAt the level of the distribution network, tactical decisions involve mainly [[inventory control]] and [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] path optimization. Note that the logistician may be required to manage the [[reverse logistics|reverse flow]] along with the forward flow.\n\n=== Warehouse management system and control ===\n\nAlthough there is some overlap in functionality, [[warehouse management system]]s (WMS) can differ significantly from [[warehouse control system]]s (WCS). Simply put, a WMS plans a weekly activity forecast based on such factors as statistics and [[Trend estimation|trends]], whereas a WCS acts like a floor supervisor, working in real-time to get the job done by the most effective means. For instance, a WMS can tell the system that it is going to need five of [[stock-keeping unit]] (SKU) A and five of SKU B hours in advance, but by the time it acts, other considerations may have come into play or there could be a logjam on a conveyor. A WCS can prevent that problem by working in real-time and adapting to the situation by making a last-minute decision based on current activity and operational status. Working [[synergistically]], WMS and WCS can resolve these issues and maximize [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] for companies that rely on the effective operation of their warehouse or distribution center.<ref name=\"sdcexec\">{{cite web\n|author=John T. Phelan, Jr. P.E\n|work=[[Supply & Demand Chain Executive]]\n|publisher=Enom, Inc\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Logistics outsourcing ===\nLogistics outsourcing involves a relationship between a company and an LSP (logistic service provider), which, compared with basic logistics services, has more customized offerings, encompasses a broad number of service activities, is characterized by a long-term orientation, and thus has a strategic nature.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.2158-1592.2011.01008.x|title = Commitment and Trust as Drivers of Loyalty in Logistics Outsourcing Relationships: Cultural Differences Between the United States and Germany| journal=Journal of Business Logistics| volume=32| pages=83\u201398|year = 2011|last1 = Wallenburg|first1 = Carl Marcus| last2=Cahill| first2=David L.| last3=Michael Knemeyer| first3=A.| last4=Goldsby| first4=Thomas J.}}</ref>\n\nOutsourcing does not have to be complete externalization to an LSP, but can also be partial:\n* A single contract for supplying a specific service on occasion\n* Creation of a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]]\n* Creation of a joint venture\n\n'''[[Third-party logistics]]''' (3PL) involves using external organizations to execute logistics activities that have traditionally been performed within an organization itself.<ref name=\"Bazio.\">{{cite journal\n|author=Baziotopoulos\n|year=2008\n|title=An Investigation of Logistics Outsourcing Practices in the Greek Manufacturing Sector\n|publisher=PhD thesis}}</ref> According to this definition, third-party logistics includes any form of outsourcing of logistics activities previously performed in house. For example, if a company with its own warehousing facilities decides to employ external transportation, this would be an example of third-party logistics. Logistics is an emerging business area in many countries.\n\nThe concept of a '''fourth-party logistics''' (4PL) provider was first defined by Andersen Consulting (now [[Accenture]]) as an integrator that assembles the resources, planning capabilities, and technology of its own organization and other organizations to design, build, and run comprehensive supply chain solutions. Whereas a third-party logistics (3PL) service provider targets a single function, a 4PL targets management of the entire process. Some have described a 4PL as a general contractor that manages other 3PLs, truckers, forwarders, custom house agents, and others, essentially taking responsibility of a complete process for the customer.\n\n=== Horizontal alliances between logistics service providers ===\n\nHorizontal [[business alliance]]s often occur between logistics service providers, i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing.<ref name=\"rauewieland\">Raue, J.S. & Wieland, A. (2015), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/IJLM-08-2012-0083 The interplay of different types of governance in horizontal cooperations: a view on logistics service providers]. The International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 26, No. 2.</ref> In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can \" resources which are directly exploitable\". In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can \"access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable\". This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.<ref name=\"rauewieland\" />\n\n== Logistics automation ==\n{{Main|Logistics automation}}\n[[File:Automated Storage and Retrieval System - Defense Visual Information Center \u00b7 DD-ST-96-00253.JPEG|thumb|200px|[[Automated storage and retrieval system]] used by the U.S. military, also used by business in conjunction with manual picking.]]\n\n[[Logistics automation]] is the application of computer software or [[Automation|automated]] machinery to improve the efficiency of logistics operations. Typically this refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center with broader tasks undertaken by [[supply chain engineering]] systems and [[enterprise resource planning]] systems.\n\nIndustrial machinery can typically identify products through either [[barcode]] or [[RFID]] technologies. Information in traditional bar codes is stored as a sequence of black and white bars varying in width, which when read by laser is translated into a digital sequence, which according to fixed rules can be converted into a decimal number or other data. Sometimes information in a bar code can be transmitted through radio frequency, more typically radio transmission is used in RFID tags. An RFID tag is a card containing a memory chip and an antenna that transmits signals to a reader. RFID may be found on merchandise, animals, vehicles, and people as well.\n\n== Logistics: profession and organizations ==\nA '''logistician''' is a professional logistics practitioner. Professional logisticians are often certified by professional associations. One can either work in a pure logistics company, such as a shipping line, airport, or [[freight forwarder]], or within the logistics department of a company. However, as mentioned above, logistics is a broad field, encompassing procurement, production, distribution, and disposal activities. Hence, career perspectives are broad as well.\nA new trend in the industry is the 4PL, or fourth-party logistics, firms, consulting companies offering logistics services.\n\nSome universities and academic institutions train students as logisticians, offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs. A university with a primary focus on logistics is [[K\u00fchne Logistics University]] in Hamburg, Germany. It is non-profit and supported by K\u00fchne-Foundation of the logistics entrepreneur [[Klaus Michael K\u00fchne]].\n\nThe [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]] (CILT), established in the United Kingdom in 1919, received a [[Royal Charter]] in 1926. The Chartered Institute is one of the [[professional bodies]] or institutions for the logistics and transport sectors that offer [[professional qualification]]s or degrees in logistics management. CILT programs can be studied at centers around the UK, some of which also offer distance learning options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/england-shipping-logistics-professional-certifications/chartered-institute-of-logistics-and-transport|title=Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) \u2013 Professional Logistics Programs|website=EduMaritime}}</ref> The institute also have overseas branches namely The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Australia (CILTA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/queensland/chartered-institute-of-logistics-transport-australia|title=Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport Australia (CILTA) \u2013 Certification & Training|website=EduMaritime}}</ref> in Australia and Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/hong-kong/chartered-institute-of-logistics-and-transport-in-hong-kong|title=Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK) \u2013 PQE Programs|website=EduMaritime}}</ref> in Hong Kong. In the UK, Logistics Management programs are conducted by many universities and professional bodies such as CILT. These programs are generally offered at the postgraduate level.\n\nThe [[Global Institute of Logistics]]<ref name=\"gil-home\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globeinst.org/|title=GIL HOME|website=Global Institute of Logistics|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> established in New York in 2003 is a [[Think tank]] for the profession and is primarily concerned with intercontinental maritime logistics. It is particularly concerned with [[Containerization|container]] logistics and the role of the [[Port authority|seaport authority]] in the maritime logistics chain. The Institute has developed a community of over 8,500 [[logistician]]s who act a global knowledge network committed to supporting the Institute's mission of contributing to the resolution of legacy challenges in global logistics. Challenges associated with the traditional approach of managing single transport modes, modal systems as stand-alone operations. The key to overcoming these legacy challenges is for the individual stakeholder groups within the logistics chain to actively engage with each other. The promotion of this agenda is the Institute's work.\n\nThe [[International Association of Public Health Logisticians]] (IAPHL)<ref name=\"iaphl\">{{Cite web|url=https://iaphl.org/|title=International Association of Public Health Logisiticians|website=IAPHL|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> is a professional network that promotes the professional development of supply chain managers and others working in the field of public health logistics and commodity security, with particular focus on developing countries. The association supports logisticians worldwide by providing a community of practice, where members can network, exchange ideas, and improve their professional skills. \n\n=== Logistics museums ===\nThere are many museums in the world which cover various aspects of practical logistics. These include museums of transportation, customs, packing, and industry-based logistics. However, only the following museums are fully dedicated to logistics:\n\nGeneral logistics:\n* Logistics Museum ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://logistics-museum.ru/en/|title=Logistics Museum|website=logistics-museum.ru|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Museum of Logistics (Tokyo, Japan)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmuse.or.jp/english/|title=Museum of Logistics {{!}} \u7269\u6d41\u535a\u7269\u9928|website=www.lmuse.or.jp|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Beijing Wuzi University]] Logistics Museum (Beijing, China)\n\nMilitary logistics:\n* [[Royal Logistic Corps Museum]] ([[Surrey]], England, United Kingdom)\n* The Canadian Forces Logistics Museum ([[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://museesmontreal.org/en/museums/canadian-forces-logistics-museum|title=Canadian Forces Logistics Museum|website=Montreal Museums|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n* Museum of the Army Logistics ([[Hanoi]], Vietnam)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Physical inventory]]\n* [[Document automation]] in supply chain management and logistics\n* [[Automated identification and data capture]]\n* [[Storage management system]]\n* [[Inventory management software]]\n* [[Freight claim]]\n* [[Sales territory]]\n* [[Integrated Service Provider]]\n* [[Performance-based logistics]]\n* [[Logistics Performance Index]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Engels, Donald W.
