{"title_page": "International Association of National Public Health Institutes", "text_new": "The '''International Association of National Public Health Institutes''' ('''IANPHI''') is a member organization of government agencies working to improve national disease prevention and response. IANPHI is made up of 100+ members, located in approximately 90 countries.<ref>IANPHI, OUR MEMBERS, http://ianphi.org/membercountries/index.html</ref> An important goal of IANPHI is to improve health outcomes by strengthening or creating NPHIs.\n\nThe IANPHI Secretariat is based at the [[Institut de veille sanitaire|Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS)]] of [[France]], and the US Office is located at the [[Emory University]] Global Health Institute in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, GA]]. The IANPHI Foundation is located in [[Finland]] at [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|THL]]. Coordinated by Secretary General Jean Claude Desenclos, the IANPHI team is responsible for member relations and programs, policy, communications and NPHI development projects (USA), and the annual meeting scientific program (France).\n\nAt its inception, IANPHI received seed funds from the Rockefeller Foundation and a one-year planning grant from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)]]. BMGF subsequently awarded multi-year funds for IANPHI's development and to support projects to build NPHIs in low- and middle-income countries. Resources have since been contributed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. CDC]]<ref>IANPHI, HISTORY. http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/history.html</ref> A recent role for IANPHI has been to work with the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance project.<ref>IANPHI, \"Champions for Addressing Childhood Mortality.\" http://www.ianphi.org/news/2016/gpb.html</ref>\n\n==The National Public Health Institute model==\nThe [[National public health institutes]] (NPHI) model, exemplified by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[Centers for Disease Control (Republic of China)|China CDC]], [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] and others, is an effective and cost-efficient way to systematically develop and sustain national public health systems. NPHIs, including China CDC, INSP in Mexico, [[Fiocruz|FIOCRUZ]] in [[Brazil]] and others in over 90 countries around the world, have been major contributors to reductions in morbidity and mortality from [[Infection|infectious]] and [[Non-communicable disease|noncommunicable]] conditions. Many, including the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland), have developed over several decades, while others, including NPHIs in [[Liberia]] and [[Canada]], were created following poorly managed threats such as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and [[SARS coronavirus|SARS]], in recognition that a coordinated system with a specialized institution is needed to effectively respond to disease threats.\n\nNPHIs usually lead national efforts for disease surveillance and outbreak investigation (to monitor population health trends and detect and resolve outbreaks), laboratory services (to identify and confirm disease threats), health programs (including recommendations for immunizations and maternal and child health initiatives), and public health workforce development and research (including new treatments and technologies). NPHIs are designed to give governments the ability to assess and address major acute and long-term disease threats in a country using scientific, evidence-based policies and strategies, as well as create a career home for public health researchers and scientists, thereby fostering the evidence-based approaches necessary to ensure that government policies are based on scientific evidence rather than politics.\n\n==History and activities==\nIn 2002, the directors of nearly 30 NPHIs met in [[Bellagio, Italy]] to share best practices and discuss opportunities for collaboration. In 2004, the group reconvened in Helsinki and declared its intention to forge an alliance.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|title=History|work=ianphi.org|access-date=2013-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428072858/http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|archive-date=2013-04-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIANPHI was formally launched at the first General Assembly in Brazil in January 2006, with 39 founding members and a one-year grant from the Gates Foundation. Under a subsequent five-year grant from the Gates Foundation awarded in late 2006, the membership has expanded to 100 institutes in 88 countries around the world.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\"/>\n\nIANPHI's activities fall into three areas:<ref>[http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017003447/http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/ |date=October 17, 2013 }}</ref> \n* Projects (targeting investments to create or strengthen NPHIs in low-resource countries)\n* Policy (developing a framework, tools and policy papers for public [[health system strengthening]])\n* Leadership development (creating an international community of NPHI directors)\n\n==Peer-to-Peer Partnerships==\nOne of IANPHI's distinctive features and strengths is a peer-assistance approach that facilitates sharing of expertise and experience among member NPHIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=IANPHI Peer-to-Peer Model|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/peertopeer.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref>  The model clearly benefits the recipient NPHI by identifying strategies to address priority needs and raising standards of performance for organizing and conducting public health functions. But it rewards the contributing institute as well \u2013 by sharing skills and assets to benefit others while also linking resources and solutions to address regional and global health threats and opportunities.\n\nFor the network of IANPHI members, the model provides unique opportunities for NPHIs to link with others that are geographically or linguistically similar or are struggling with similar technical or programmatic issues, such as information system development or pandemic preparedness.  This collaborative approach also provides a platform for developing research or programs to address shared issues, whether laboratory safety or avian influenza, tobacco use or injury.\n\nCurrent peer-to-peer partnerships include:\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/inlasapartnership.html Peru and Bolivia - INLASA Partnership]\n*Norway and Malawi - [http://ianphi.org/news/2014/malawinorway.html Host Workshop] and [http://ianphi.org/news/2013/norway.html Peer-to-Peer organizational development]\n*[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/projects/kenya.html UK and Kenya - Science-to-Policy Expertise]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/phacvisit.html Canada and Kenya - Study Tour]\n*Morocco and Togo - Strengthening Information Systems\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/uvriphe.html UK and Uganda - Communications and Advocacy]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/peertopeermodel.html France and Togo - Epidemic Intelligence and Disease Surveillance]\n*France and Togo/C\u00f4te d'Ivoire - Influencing Policy through Publication\n\n==Heymann Mentorship Program==\n[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/heymannmentorshipprogram.html The IANPHI Heymann Mentorship Program] aims to encourage public health leadership growth by facilitating one-on-one relationships between established public health leaders and less-experienced counterparts in low-resource countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heymann Mentorship Program|url=http://www.ianphi.org/resources/toolkit/mentorship.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> It is part of an ongoing IANPHI effort to build human capacity and provide a career path for public health professionals through training in strategic leadership and management. Part of this commitment involves providing current and future NPHI leaders with the tools, training, and support they need to develop their full potential.\n\nThe Heymann Mentorship Program provides each mentee (\"fellow\") an opportunity to develop an ongoing relationship with a mentor with career experience as a public health expert and leader. The program focuses on current and future leaders of NPHIs in IANPHI project sites and strategically targets persons interested in guidance, coaching, counseling, and professional development.\n\n==List of IANPHI members==\n\n===Full Members===\n{{External links|section|date=March 2016}}\n# Afghanistan: [http://moph.gov.af/en Afghan Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|title=Afghan National Public Health Institute|url=http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|publisher=Moph.gov.af|accessdate=2015-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406065246/http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|archive-date=2015-04-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n# Albania: [http://ishp.gov.al/ Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ishp.gov.al/|title=Instituti i Sh\u00ebndetit Publik -

NIHE hopes to get a better understanding of the biological mechanism for gastric cancer in order to provide better diagnosis and treatment options for people in Vietnam, where gastric cancer is the second most common cancer found in men and the third most common in women.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of national public health agencies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.ianphi.org/}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Association of National Public Health Institutes, The}}\n[[Category:Public health organizations]]\n[[Category:International medical and health organizations]]\n[[Category:International organizations based in France]]\n", "text_old": "The '''International Association of National Public Health Institutes''' ('''IANPHI''') is a member organization of government agencies working to improve national disease prevention and response. IANPHI is made up of 100+ members, located in approximately 90 countries.<ref>IANPHI, OUR MEMBERS, http://ianphi.org/membercountries/index.html</ref> An important goal of IANPHI is to improve health outcomes by strengthening or creating NPHIs.\n\nThe IANPHI Secretariat is based at the [[Institut de veille sanitaire|Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS)]] of [[France]], and the US Office is located at the [[Emory University]] Global Health Institute in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, GA]]. The IANPHI Foundation is located in [[Finland]] at [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|THL]]. Coordinated by Secretary General Jean Claude Desenclos, the IANPHI team is responsible for member relations and programs, policy, communications and NPHI development projects (USA), and the annual meeting scientific program (France).\n\nAt its inception, IANPHI received seed funds from the Rockefeller Foundation and a one-year planning grant from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)]]. BMGF subsequently awarded multi-year funds for IANPHI's development and to support projects to build NPHIs in low- and middle-income countries. Resources have since been contributed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. CDC]]<ref>IANPHI, HISTORY. http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/history.html</ref> A recent role for IANPHI has been to work with the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance project.<ref>IANPHI, \"Champions for Addressing Childhood Mortality.\" http://www.ianphi.org/news/2016/gpb.html</ref>\n\n==The National Public Health Institute model==\nThe [[National public health institutes]] (NPHI) model, exemplified by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[Centers for Disease Control (Republic of China)|China CDC]], [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] and others, is an effective and cost-efficient way to systematically develop and sustain national public health systems. NPHIs, including China CDC, INSP in Mexico, [[Fiocruz|FIOCRUZ]] in [[Brazil]] and others in over 90 countries around the world, have been major contributors to reductions in morbidity and mortality from [[Infection|infectious]] and [[Non-communicable disease|noncommunicable]] conditions. Many, including the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland), have developed over several decades, while others, including NPHIs in [[Liberia]] and [[Canada]], were created following poorly managed threats such as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and [[SARS coronavirus|SARS]], in recognition that a coordinated system with a specialized institution is needed to effectively respond to disease threats.\n\nNPHIs usually lead national efforts for disease surveillance and outbreak investigation (to monitor population health trends and detect and resolve outbreaks), laboratory services (to identify and confirm disease threats), health programs (including recommendations for immunizations and maternal and child health initiatives), and public health workforce development and research (including new treatments and technologies). NPHIs are designed to give governments the ability to assess and address major acute and long-term disease threats in a country using scientific, evidence-based policies and strategies, as well as create a career home for public health researchers and scientists, thereby fostering the evidence-based approaches necessary to ensure that government policies are based on scientific evidence rather than politics.\n\n==History and activities==\nIn 2002, the directors of nearly 30 NPHIs met in [[Bellagio, Italy]] to share best practices and discuss opportunities for collaboration. In 2004, the group reconvened in Helsinki and declared its intention to forge an alliance.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|title=History|work=ianphi.org|access-date=2013-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428072858/http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|archive-date=2013-04-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIANPHI was formally launched at the first General Assembly in Brazil in January 2006, with 39 founding members and a one-year grant from the Gates Foundation. Under a subsequent five-year grant from the Gates Foundation awarded in late 2006, the membership has expanded to 100 institutes in 88 countries around the world.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\"/>\n\nIANPHI's activities fall into three areas:<ref>[http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017003447/http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/ |date=October 17, 2013 }}</ref> \n* Projects (targeting investments to create or strengthen NPHIs in low-resource countries)\n* Policy (developing a framework, tools and policy papers for public [[health system strengthening]])\n* Leadership development (creating an international community of NPHI directors)\n\n==Peer-to-Peer Partnerships==\nOne of IANPHI's distinctive features and strengths is a peer-assistance approach that facilitates sharing of expertise and experience among member NPHIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=IANPHI Peer-to-Peer Model|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/peertopeer.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref>  The model clearly benefits the recipient NPHI by identifying strategies to address priority needs and raising standards of performance for organizing and conducting public health functions. But it rewards the contributing institute as well \u2013 by sharing skills and assets to benefit others while also linking resources and solutions to address regional and global health threats and opportunities.\n\nFor the network of IANPHI members, the model provides unique opportunities for NPHIs to link with others that are geographically or linguistically similar or are struggling with similar technical or programmatic issues, such as information system development or pandemic preparedness.  This collaborative approach also provides a platform for developing research or programs to address shared issues, whether laboratory safety or avian influenza, tobacco use or injury.\n\nCurrent peer-to-peer partnerships include:\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/inlasapartnership.html Peru and Bolivia - INLASA Partnership]\n*Norway and Malawi - [http://ianphi.org/news/2014/malawinorway.html Host Workshop] and [http://ianphi.org/news/2013/norway.html Peer-to-Peer organizational development]\n*[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/projects/kenya.html UK and Kenya - Science-to-Policy Expertise]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/phacvisit.html Canada and Kenya - Study Tour]\n*Morocco and Togo - Strengthening Information Systems\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/uvriphe.html UK and Uganda - Communications and Advocacy]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/peertopeermodel.html France and Togo - Epidemic Intelligence and Disease Surveillance]\n*France and Togo/C\u00f4te d'Ivoire - Influencing Policy through Publication\n\n==Heymann Mentorship Program==\n[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/heymannmentorshipprogram.html The IANPHI Heymann Mentorship Program] aims to encourage public health leadership growth by facilitating one-on-one relationships between established public health leaders and less-experienced counterparts in low-resource countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heymann Mentorship Program|url=http://www.ianphi.org/resources/toolkit/mentorship.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> It is part of an ongoing IANPHI effort to build human capacity and provide a career path for public health professionals through training in strategic leadership and management. Part of this commitment involves providing current and future NPHI leaders with the tools, training, and support they need to develop their full potential.\n\nThe Heymann Mentorship Program provides each mentee (\"fellow\") an opportunity to develop an ongoing relationship with a mentor with career experience as a public health expert and leader. The program focuses on current and future leaders of NPHIs in IANPHI project sites and strategically targets persons interested in guidance, coaching, counseling, and professional development.\n\n==List of IANPHI members==\n\n===Full Members===\n{{External links|section|date=March 2016}}\n# Afghanistan: [http://moph.gov.af/en Afghan Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|title=Afghan National Public Health Institute|url=http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|publisher=Moph.gov.af|accessdate=2015-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406065246/http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|archive-date=2015-04-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n# Albania: [http://ishp.gov.al/ Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ishp.gov.al/|title=Instituti i Sh\u00ebndetit Publik -

Several diseases in Uganda have been traced to Aedes africanus arbovirus spread by mosquitoes including epidemics of yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue, and West Nile virus.\n\n'''Vietnam: Use Molecular Methods to Study and Identify the cagA Gene in H. pylori Infected Gastric Cancer Patients'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ianphi.org/member-countries/country.cfm/count_id/6C9C1329-123F-73FE-8906979C977B63DC#institute1 |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719104516/http://www.ianphi.org/member-countries/country.cfm/count_id/6C9C1329-123F-73FE-8906979C977B63DC |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Vietnam]] National Institute of Hygiene & Epidemiology (NIHE) will use molecular methods to study and identify the cagA gene in H. pylori infected gastric cancer patients.

It was founded in 1958 by choreographer and dancer [[Alvin Ailey]].  It is made up of 32 dancers, led by artistic director [[Robert Battle]] and associate artistic director Matthew Rushing.\n\n==History==\nAlvin Ailey and a group of young Black modern dancers first performed at New York's 92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association ([[92nd Street Y]]), under the name Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT), in March 1958. Ailey was the company's director, choreographer, and principal dancer. The company started as an ensemble of only seven dancers, plus their choreographer, and many guest choreographers.<ref name=IED>\u201cAlvin Ailey American Dance Theatre: Origins to 1979\u201d, ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'', vol. 1. Oxford University Press, New York: 1979. 54-57.</ref> Following their first performance, which included Ailey's ''Blues Suite'', the company traveled on what were known as the \"station wagon tours\"; in 1960, the AAADT became a resident company of the [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]] [[YWCA]]'s Clark Center for the Performing Arts. During this period Ailey choreographed his famous work ''[[Revelations (Alvin Ailey)|Revelations]]'', a character dance done to traditional music. In 1962, Ailey changed his all-black dance company into a multi-racial group, believing that there was a kind of reverse chauvinism to anything all black.<ref name=IED /> In that same year, the company was chosen to tour the Far East, Southeast Asia and [[Australia]] as part of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s \"President's Special International Program for Cultural Presentations\". AAADT was the first \"Black\" company to travel for Kennedy's program. [[Judith Jamison]], a star of the company for 15 years, joined the company in 1965.\n\nAiley established a school in 1969, the same year that the company moved to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].  Both company and school relocated to 229 East 59th Street in Manhattan a year later, to a renovated church building.  In April of that year, a financial crisis caused Ailey to issue a statement that the dissolution of the company might take place.  The crisis abated, however, and in 1971 AAADT made its first performance at the [[New York City Center]], where it is currently the resident company. Associate artistic director Masazumi Chaya joined the company in 1972.\n\nAAADT, the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble (later renamed Ailey II) and the Ailey School relocated in 1980 to four new studios in a building on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].  The company celebrated its 25th anniversary three years later.

It was founded in 1958 by choreographer and dancer [[Alvin Ailey]].  It is made up of 32 dancers, led by artistic director [[Robert Battle]] and associate artistic director [[Matthew Rushing]].\n\n==History==\nAlvin Ailey and a group of young Black modern dancers first performed at New York's 92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association ([[92nd Street Y]]), under the name Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT), in March 1958. Ailey was the company's director, choreographer, and principal dancer. The company started as an ensemble of only seven dancers, plus their choreographer, and many guest choreographers.<ref name=IED>\u201cAlvin Ailey American Dance Theatre: Origins to 1979\u201d, ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'', vol. 1. Oxford University Press, New York: 1979. 54-57.</ref> Following their first performance, which included Ailey's ''Blues Suite'', the company traveled on what were known as the \"station wagon tours\"; in 1960, the AAADT became a resident company of the [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]] [[YWCA]]'s Clark Center for the Performing Arts. During this period Ailey choreographed his famous work ''[[Revelations (Alvin Ailey)|Revelations]]'', a character dance done to traditional music. In 1962, Ailey changed his all-black dance company into a multi-racial group, believing that there was a kind of reverse chauvinism to anything all black.<ref name=IED /> In that same year, the company was chosen to tour the Far East, Southeast Asia and [[Australia]] as part of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s \"President's Special International Program for Cultural Presentations\". AAADT was the first \"Black\" company to travel for Kennedy's program. [[Judith Jamison]], a star of the company for 15 years, joined the company in 1965.\n\nAiley established a school in 1969, the same year that the company moved to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].  Both company and school relocated to 229 East 59th Street in Manhattan a year later, to a renovated church building.  In April of that year, a financial crisis caused Ailey to issue a statement that the dissolution of the company might take place.  The crisis abated, however, and in 1971 AAADT made its first performance at the [[New York City Center]], where it is currently the resident company. Associate artistic director Masazumi Chaya joined the company in 1972.\n\nAAADT, the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble (later renamed Ailey II) and the Ailey School relocated in 1980 to four new studios in a building on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].  The company celebrated its 25th anniversary three years later.  Alvin Ailey died on December 1, 1989; before his death he selected Judith Jamison to succeed him as artistic director,<ref name=Henderson/> and the entire Ailey organization moved to 211 West 61st Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
