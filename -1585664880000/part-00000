It received widespread critical acclaim and was a major commercial success at the box office, grossing \u20b939 crore worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nSaji, Bonny, Bobby and Franky are four brothers living in a small, cramped house in a wasteland area of Kumbalangi village. Saji's father had married Bonny's mother, who then gave birth to Bobby and Franky. When their father dies, the mother abandons the boys to join a religious mission, leaving Saji to be the man of the house. Saji has anger management issues, and often gets into fights with Bobby, an unemployed youngster. Franky is ashamed of Saji and Bobby but gets along well with Bonny, who is mute.\n\nBobby starts dating Baby, a girl who lives nearby. He proposes to her, which she accepts but asks him to talk to her family. Bobby asks Saji to accompany him to talk to Baby's family. They meet Shammi, Baby's brother-in-law, who denies the proposal and ridicules the poor reputation that Bobby's family has among the villagers. Saji tries to console Bobby and asks him to get a job, which  he does.\n\nOne day, a fight breaks out between Saji and Franky. Bonny, who is very protective of Franky, hits Saji. Ashamed, Saji leaves the house and takes to drinking with his friend Vijay. In his drunken stupor, Saji tries to commit suicide. Vijay saves him but loses his own life in the process.\nStricken with remorse, Saji goes to Vijay's house to apologise to his wife, Sathi, where he finds her in labour. He takes her to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby girl. Saji takes Sathi and her daughter to his house. Meanwhile, Bonny has brought home an American tourist, Nylah, who has been kicked out of her hotel for inviting Bonny there. Franky is pleased to have the two women in the house, as it gives them some semblance of being a regular family.\n\nSome time later, Saji approaches Shammi again and asks him to reconsider the proposal, which Shammi refuses. Baby makes up her mind to elope with Bobby. However, Shammi finds out about Baby's plans, and turns abusive and violent. He assaults Baby, her sister and their mother, holding them captive in their own home. When Baby fails to return his calls, Bobby get anxious and decides to check up on her. Bobby's brothers volunteer to help, and the four arrive at Baby's house. Together, they manage to trap Shammi with a fishing net and set the women free. Bobby and Baby are finally reunited and get married.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shane Nigam]] as Bobby Napoleon \n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Saji Napoleon\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Shammi\n* [[Anna Ben]] as Baby Mol<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manoramaonline.com/movies/movie-news/2019/02/09/anna-ben-about-kumbalangi-nights-fahadh-faasil.html|title=\u0d37\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d31\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a \u0d2c\u0d47\u0d2c\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d7e; \u0d05\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d2c\u0d46\u0d7b \u0d05\u0d2d\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d16\u0d02|website=ManoramaOnline.com|accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Sreenath Bhasi]] as Bonny\n* [[Mathew Thomas]] as Franky Napoleon<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/my-character-in-kumbalangi-nights-isnt-very-different-from-me/articleshow/67827686.cms | title='My character in Kumbalangi Nights isn't very different from me' | date=4 February 2019 | newspaper=The Times of India | accessdate=28 March 2019 }}</ref>\n* [[Grace Antony]] as Simmy<Ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manoramaonline.com/movies/interview/2019/02/12/chat-with-grace-antony-kumbalangi-nights-simy.html|title=\u0d06 '\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d38\u0d4d \u0d21\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d4d' \u0d05\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d24\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d: \u0d37\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d31\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a \u0d38\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d3f \u0d2a\u0d31\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d41|website=ManoramaOnline.com|accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> \n* Sooraj Pops as Prasanth, Bobby's friend \n* [[Ramesh Thilak]] as Murugan aka Vijay\n* Jasmine M\u00e8tivier as Nylah\n* [[Riya Saira]] as Sumeesha\n* Baiju Johnson as Baby and Simmy's Uncle\n* [[Sheela Rajkumar]] as Sathi\n* Ambika Rao as Baby and Simmy's Mother\n* Ajith Moorkooth as Psychiatrist\n* Ansal Palluruthy as Shyju\n*[[Dileesh Pothan]] as Police Inspector Raju Unni ([[Cameo appearance]])\n*Poli Sharath as Bar DJ\n{{colend}}\n\n==Analysis==\n{{quote box\n| width = 30%\n| align = right\n| quote = \"There [is] this idea of \u2018the complete man\u2019, who can also be the dysfunctional man.

Writing the script took around 5 years, during which time Pushkaran worked on other films as well, but the final draft was completed in around six months. Pushkaran clarified that the film was not based on any real life incident or person and was a relatively difficult one to write.

It received widespread critical acclaim and was a major commercial success at the box office, grossing \u20b939 crore worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nSaji, Bonny, Bobby and Franky are four brothers living in a small, cramped house in a wasteland area of Kumbalangi village. Saji's father had married Bonny's mother, who then gave birth to Bobby and Franky. When their father dies, the mother abandons the boys to join a religious mission, leaving Saji to be the man of the house. Saji has anger management issues, and often gets into fights with Bobby, an unemployed youngster. Franky is ashamed of Saji and Bobby but gets along well with Bonny, who is mute.\n\nBobby starts dating Baby, a girl who lives nearby. He proposes to her, which she accepts but asks him to talk to her family. Bobby asks Saji to accompany him to talk to Baby's family. They meet Shammi, Baby's brother-in-law, who denies the proposal and ridicules the poor reputation that Bobby's family has among the villagers. Saji tries to console Bobby and asks him to get a job, which  he does.\n\nOne day, a fight breaks out between Saji and Franky. Bonny, who is very protective of Franky, hits Saji. Ashamed, Saji leaves the house and takes to drinking with his friend Vijay. In his drunken stupor, Saji tries to commit suicide. Vijay saves him but loses his own life in the process.\nStricken with remorse, Saji goes to Vijay's house to apologise to his wife, Sathi, where he finds her in labour. He takes her to the hospital, where she gives birth to a baby girl. Saji takes Sathi and her daughter to his house. Meanwhile, Bonny has brought home an American tourist, Nylah, who has been kicked out of her hotel for inviting Bonny there. Franky is pleased to have the two women in the house, as it gives them some semblance of being a regular family.\n\nSome time later, Saji approaches Shammi and asks him to reconsider the proposal, which Shammi refuses. Baby makes up her mind to elope with Bobby. However, Shammi finds out about Baby's plans, and instantly turns abusive and violent in a manner that becomes clear that he suffers from a mental disorder. Shammi assaults Baby, her sister and their mother, holding them captive in their own home.\n\nMeanwhile, Bobby get anxious and decides to check up on Baby. Bobby's brothers volunteer to help, and they arrive at Baby's house.\nAfter a struggle, they finally trap Shammi with a fishing net and set the women free. Bobby and Baby are finally reunited and get married.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shane Nigam]] as Bobby Napoleon \n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Saji Napoleon\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Shammi\n* [[Anna Ben]] as Baby Mol<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manoramaonline.com/movies/movie-news/2019/02/09/anna-ben-about-kumbalangi-nights-fahadh-faasil.html|title=\u0d37\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d31\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a \u0d2c\u0d47\u0d2c\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d7e; \u0d05\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d2c\u0d46\u0d7b \u0d05\u0d2d\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d16\u0d02|website=ManoramaOnline.com|accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Sreenath Bhasi]] as Bonny\n* [[Mathew Thomas]] as Franky Napoleon<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/my-character-in-kumbalangi-nights-isnt-very-different-from-me/articleshow/67827686.cms | title='My character in Kumbalangi Nights isn't very different from me' | date=4 February 2019 | newspaper=The Times of India | accessdate=28 March 2019 }}</ref>\n* [[Grace Antony]] as Simmy<Ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manoramaonline.com/movies/interview/2019/02/12/chat-with-grace-antony-kumbalangi-nights-simy.html|title=\u0d06 '\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d38\u0d4d \u0d21\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d4d' \u0d05\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d24\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d: \u0d37\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d31\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a \u0d38\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d3f \u0d2a\u0d31\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d41|website=ManoramaOnline.com|accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> \n* Sooraj Pops as Prasanth, Bobby's friend \n* [[Ramesh Thilak]] as Murugan aka Vijay\n* Jasmine M\u00e8tivier as Nylah\n* [[Riya Saira]] as Sumeesha\n* Baiju Johnson as Baby and Simmy's Uncle\n* [[Sheela Rajkumar]] as Sathi\n* Ambika Rao as Baby and Simmy's Mother\n* Ajith Moorkooth as Psychiatrist\n* Ansal Palluruthy as Shyju\n*[[Dileesh Pothan]] as Police Inspector Raju Unni ([[Cameo appearance]])\n*Poli Sharath as Bar DJ\n{{colend}}\n\n==Analysis==\n{{quote box\n| width = 30%\n| align = right\n| quote = \"There [is] this idea of \u2018the complete man\u2019, who can also be the dysfunctional man.

Writing the script took around 5 years, during which time Pushkaran worked on other films as well, but the final draft was completed in around six months. Pushkaran clarified that the film was not based on any real life incident or person and was a relatively difficult one to write. However, he has stated that the character of Saji was influenced by a man with suicidal tendencies he encountered in his village in his youth.<ref name=\"Anand 2019\">{{cite web | last=Nair Anand | first=Shilpa | title=The story of Kumbalangi Nights | website=The Hindu | date=8 February 2019 | url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/scenarist-syam-pushkaran-on-telling-the-story-of-kumbalangi-nights/article26212032.ece | access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=Aswathy|title='I've Always Wanted To Write A Family Drama': Screenwriter Syam Pushkaran On 'Kumbalangi Nights'|url=https://silverscreen.in/features/ive-always-wanted-to-write-a-family-drama-screenwriter-syam-pushkaran-on-kumbalangi-nights/|website=Silverscreen.in|accessdate=14 February 2019|date=5 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Mathews 2019\">{{cite web | last=Mathews | first=Anna | title=Inspired by real characters: Writer Syam Pushkaran | website=The Times of India | date=9 February 2019 | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/inspired-by-real-characters-writer-syam-pushkaran/articleshow/67914725.cms | access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nIn 2011, while he was co-writing ''[[Salt N' Pepper]]'', Pushkaran discussed the idea with its assistant director Madhu C.

It has also been widely used for all sorts of utensils due to many properties, such as low melting point, workability (both with hand tools and with modern [[lathe|turning]] and [[milling (machining)|milling]] machines), durability, [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. It is still commonly used in applications where low [[friction]] and corrosion resistance is required, such as [[padlock|lock]]s, [[hinge]]s, [[gear]]s, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[ammunition]] casings, [[zipper]]s, [[plumbing]], [[hose coupling]]s, [[valve]]s, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical plugs and sockets]].  It is also used extensively for [[brass instrument|musical instruments]] such as [[horn  (instrument)|horn]]s and [[metallophone|bell]]s.

The relatively low [[melting point]] of brass ({{Convert|900|to|940|C|disp=comma}}, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast. By varying the proportions of copper and zinc, the properties of the brass can be changed, allowing hard and soft brasses.

Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry, where it is melted and recast into [[billet (semi-finished product)|billet]]s. Billets are heated and extruded into the desired form and size.  The general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of [[cutting fluid]], though there are exceptions to this.<ref name=\"Camm1949\">{{cite book|author=Frederick James Camm|title=Newnes Engineer's Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXxGAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=George Newnes|page=594}}</ref>\n\nAluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in [[seawater]] applications (naval brasses).

This often happens when the copper reacts with sulfur to form a brown and eventually black surface layer of [[copper sulfide]] which, if regularly exposed to slightly acidic water such as urban rainwater, can then oxidize in air to form a [[patina]] of green-blue [[copper sulfate]]{{clarification needed|reason=since copper sulfate is freely soluble in water it cannot form a patina where exposed to rainwater|date=January 2020}}. Depending on how the sulfide/ sulfate layer was formed, this layer may protect the underlying brass from further damage.<ref>{{cite book|title=Metals in America's Historic Buildings: Uses and Preservation Treatments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7fCMfvnCKAC&pg=PA119|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, Technical Preservation Services|page=119}}</ref>\n\nAlthough copper and zinc have a large difference in [[electrical potential]], the resulting brass alloy does not experience internalized [[galvanic corrosion]] because of the absence of a corrosive environment within the mixture.  However, if brass is placed in contact with a more noble metal such as silver or gold in such an environment, the brass will corrode galvanically; conversely, if brass is in contact with a less-noble metal such as zinc or iron, the less noble metal will corrode and the brass will be protected.\n\n==Lead content==\nTo enhance the machinability of brass, [[lead]] is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower [[melting point]] than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stagnation Time, Composition, pH, and Orthophosphate Effects on Metal Leaching from Brass|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency|date = September 1996|location = Washington DC|page = 7|id = EPA/600/R-96/103}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content.

Applications with high water temperatures, [[chloride]]s present or deviating water qualities ([[soft water]]) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water [[boiler]] systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.\n\nAn example of DZR brass is the C352 brass, with about 30% zinc, 61-63% copper, 1.7-2.8% lead, and 0.02-0.15% arsenic. The lead and arsenic significantly suppress the zinc loss.<ref>https://www.metalalloyscorporation.com/pdf/c352-dezincification-resistant-brass.pdf</ref>\n\n\"Red brasses\", family of alloys with high copper proportion and generally less than 15% zinc, are more resistant to zinc loss. One of the metals called \"red brass\" is 85% copper, 5% tin, 5% lead, and 5% zinc. Copper Alloy C23000, which is also known as \"red brass\", contains 84\u201386% copper, 0.05% each iron and lead, with the balance being zinc.\n\nAnother such material is [[gunmetal]], from the family of red brasses. Gunmetal alloys contain roughly 88% copper, 8-10% tin, and 2-4% zinc. Lead can be added for ease of machining or for bearing alloys.\n\n\"Naval brass\", for use in seawater, contains 40% zinc but also 1% tin. The tin addition suppresses zinc leaching.\n\nThe [[NSF International]] requires brasses with more than 15% zinc, used in [[piping and plumbing fitting]]s, to be dezincification-resistant.<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/composition-of-common-brass-alloys-2340109</ref>\n\n==Use in musical instruments==\n[[File:Trumpets02262006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A collection of brass instruments]]{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe high [[Ductility|malleability]] and workability, relatively good resistance to [[corrosion]], and traditionally attributed [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties of brass, have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of [[musical instrument]]s whose acoustic [[resonator]]s consist of long, relatively narrow tubing, often folded or coiled for compactness; [[silver]] and its alloys, and even [[gold]], have been used for the same reasons, but brass is the most economical choice. Collectively known as [[brass instrument]]s, these include the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and [[French horn]], and many other \"[[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s\", many in variously-sized families, such as the [[saxhorns]]. \n\nOther [[wind instrument]]s may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s are made of some variety of brass, usually a [[cupronickel]] [[alloy]] similar to [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. [[Clarinets]], especially low clarinets such as the [[Contrabass clarinet|contrabass]] and [[Subcontrabass clarinet|subcontrabass]], are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller [[woodwind]]s. For the same reason, some low [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]]s feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal. The use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. Even though the [[saxophone]]s and [[sarrusophone]]s are classified as [[woodwind instrument]]s, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.\n\nThe keywork of most modern [[woodwind]]s, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools\u2014a boon to quick repairs. The [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]s of both [[brass instruments]] and, less commonly, [[woodwind]] instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well.\n\nNext to the [[brass instruments]], the most notable use of brass in music is in various [[percussion instrument]]s, most notably [[cymbal]]s, [[gong]]s, and [[chimes|orchestral (tubular) bells]] (large \"church\" [[bell]]s are normally made of [[bronze]]). Small [[handbell]]s and \"[[jingle bell]]\" are also commonly made of brass.\n\nThe [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the [[reed pipe|shallot]] (or beat \"through\" the shallot in the case of a \"free\" reed). Although not part of the brass section, [[snare drum]]s are also sometimes made of brass. Some parts on [[electric guitars]] are also made from brass, especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties, and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction.\n\n==Germicidal and antimicrobial applications==\n{{Main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\n\n{{See also|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}\n\nThe [[bactericidal]] properties of brass have been observed for centuries, particularly in marine environments where it prevents [[biofouling]].

The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[British Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.\n\n==Brass types==\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Cu Zn.svg|thumb|right|400px|Binary phase diagram]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! colspan=2 | Proportion by weight (%)\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n!

The metal of the early 12th-century [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is unusual even by medieval standards in being a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, [[nickel]], iron, [[antimony]] and [[arsenic]] with an unusually large amount of [[silver]], ranging from 22.5% in the base to 5.76% in the pan below the candle.  The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins, probably Late Roman.<ref>Noel Stratford, pp. 232, 245, in Zarnecki, George and others; ''English Romanesque Art, 1066\u20131200'', 1984, Arts Council of Great Britain, {{ISBN|0728703866}}</ref>  [[Latten]] is a term for decorative borders and similar objects cut from sheet metal, whether of brass or bronze.  [[Aquamanile]]s were typically made in brass in both the European and Islamic worlds.\n[[File:WLA lacma 1250 Aquamanile.jpg|thumb|left|Brass [[aquamanile]] from [[Lower Saxony]], Germany, c. 1250]]\n\nThe cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both Europe and the [[Islamic world]] seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took place in open-topped crucibles.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, pp. 224\u20135</ref> Islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as ''tutiya'' or [[tutty]] rather than zinc ores for brass-making, resulting in a metal with lower [[iron]] impurities.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, 78</ref> A number of Islamic writers and the 13th century [[Italians|Italian]] [[Marco Polo]] describe how this was obtained by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] from zinc ores and [[Condensation|condensed]] onto [[clay]] or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at [[Hindu Kush|Kush]] in Iran.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, pp. 73\u20136</ref> It could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamd\u0101n\u012b|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 75</ref> The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisin]]s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\nIn Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.<ref>Rehren, T (1999) \"The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe\" in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp. 252\u20137</ref> The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226</ref> Albertus Magnus noted that the \"power\" of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 176\u20138</ref> \nGerman brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 173\u20135</ref>\n\n===Brass in Africa===\n[[File:Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG|thumb|upright|12th century \"[[Bronze Head from Ife]]\", actually of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\"]]\nSome of the most famous objects in [[African art]] are the [[lost wax]] castings of West Africa, mostly from what is now [[Nigeria]], produced first by the [[Kingdom of Ife]] and then the [[Benin Empire]].  Though normally described as \"bronzes\", the [[Benin Bronzes]], now mostly in the [[British Museum]] and other Western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the [[Bronze Head from Ife]] of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\" and the [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], both also British Museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=618380 \"The Ife Head\"] on the British Museum collection database. Accessed 26 May 2014</ref>  Work in brass or bronze continued to be important in [[Benin art]] and other West African traditions such as [[Akan goldweights]], where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in Europe.\n\n===Brass making in Renaissance and post-medieval Europe===\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 95\u2013111</ref> These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&nbsp;kg of brass.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 105\u20136</ref> There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature, not entirely liquid, process.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 103</ref> The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 104</ref> Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 100</ref>\n\n16th-century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181\u20132, de Ruette 1995</ref> Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace. By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingot]]s from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198</ref>\n\nEventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloy]]ed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering,<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\">Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228</ref> and by 1657 the German chemist [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was \"nothing else but unmeltable zinc\" and that zinc was a \"half ripe metal.\"<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198\u20139</ref> However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from England may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar to those found in some zinc ingots from China.<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\"/>\n \nHowever, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900\u2013950&nbsp;\u00b0C and lasting up to 10 hours.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226\u20137.</ref> The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by

It has also been widely used for all sorts of utensils due to many properties, such as low melting point, workability (both with hand tools and with modern [[lathe|turning]] and [[milling (machining)|milling]] machines), durability, [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. It is still commonly used in applications where low [[friction]] and corrosion resistance is required, such as [[padlock|lock]]s, [[hinge]]s, [[gear]]s, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[ammunition]] casings, [[zipper]]s, [[plumbing]], [[hose coupling]]s, [[valve]]s, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical plugs and sockets]].

The relatively low [[melting point]] of brass ({{Convert|900|to|940|C|disp=comma}}, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast.

Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry, where it is melted and recast into [[billet (semi-finished product)|billet]]s.

The general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of [[cutting fluid]], though there are exceptions to this.<ref name=\"Camm1949\">{{cite book|author=Frederick James Camm|title=Newnes Engineer's Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXxGAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=George Newnes|page=594}}</ref>\n\nAluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing.

This often happens when the copper reacts with sulfur to form a brown and eventually black surface layer of [[copper sulfide]] which, if regularly exposed to slightly acidic water such as urban rainwater, can then oxidize in air to form a [[patina]] of green-blue [[copper sulfate]]{{clarification needed|reason=since copper sulfate is freely soluble in water it cannot form a patina where exposed to rainwater|date=January 2020}}. Depending on how the sulfide/ sulfate layer was formed, this layer may protect the underlying brass from further damage.<ref>{{cite book|title=Metals in America's Historic Buildings: Uses and Preservation Treatments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7fCMfvnCKAC&pg=PA119|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, Technical Preservation Services|page=119}}</ref>\n\nAlthough copper and zinc have a large difference in [[electrical potential]], the resulting brass alloy does not experience internalized [[galvanic corrosion]] because of the absence of a corrosive environment within the mixture.  However, if brass is placed in contact with a more noble metal such as silver or gold in such an environment, the brass will corrode galvanically; conversely, if brass is in contact with a less-noble metal such as zinc or iron, the less noble metal will corrode and the brass will be protected.\n\n==Lead content==\nTo enhance the machinability of brass, [[lead]] is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower [[melting point]] than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stagnation Time, Composition, pH, and Orthophosphate Effects on Metal Leaching from Brass|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency|date = September 1996|location = Washington DC|page = 7|id = EPA/600/R-96/103}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content.

Applications with high water temperatures, [[chloride]]s present or deviating water qualities ([[soft water]]) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water [[boiler]] systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.\n\nAn example of DZR brass is the C352 brass, with about 30% zinc, 61-63% copper, 1.7-2.8% lead, and 0.02-0.15% arsenic. The lead and arsenic significantly suppress the zinc loss.<ref>https://www.metalalloyscorporation.com/pdf/c352-dezincification-resistant-brass.pdf</ref>\n\n\"Red brasses\", family of alloys with high copper proportion and generally less than 15% zinc, are more resistant to zinc loss. One of the metals called \"red brass\" is 85% copper, 5% tin, 5% lead, and 5% zinc. Copper Alloy C23000, which is also known as \"red brass\", contains 84\u201386% copper, 0.05% each iron and lead, with the balance being zinc.\n\nAnother such material is [[gunmetal]], from the family of red brasses. Gunmetal alloys contain roughly 88% copper, 8-10% tin, and 2-4% zinc. Lead can be added for ease of machining or for bearing alloys.\n\n\"Naval brass\", for use in seawater, contains 40% zinc but also 1% tin. The tin addition suppresses zinc leaching.\n\nThe [[NSF International]] requires brasses with more than 15% zinc, used in [[piping and plumbing fitting]]s, to be dezincification-resistant.<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/composition-of-common-brass-alloys-2340109</ref>\n\n==Use in musical instruments==\n[[File:Trumpets02262006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A collection of brass instruments]]{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe high [[Ductility|malleability]] and workability, relatively good resistance to [[corrosion]], and traditionally attributed [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties of brass, have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of [[musical instrument]]s whose acoustic [[resonator]]s consist of long, relatively narrow tubing, often folded or coiled for compactness; [[silver]] and its alloys, and even [[gold]], have been used for the same reasons, but brass is the most economical choice. Collectively known as [[brass instrument]]s, these include the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and [[French horn]], and many other \"[[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s\", many in variously-sized families, such as the [[saxhorns]]. \n\nOther [[wind instrument]]s may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s are made of some variety of brass, usually a [[cupronickel]] [[alloy]] similar to [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. [[Clarinets]], especially low clarinets such as the [[Contrabass clarinet|contrabass]] and [[Subcontrabass clarinet|subcontrabass]], are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller [[woodwind]]s. For the same reason, some low [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]]s feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal. The use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. Even though the [[saxophone]]s and [[sarrusophone]]s are classified as [[woodwind instrument]]s, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.\n\nThe keywork of most modern [[woodwind]]s, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as [[nickel silver]]/[[German silver]]. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools\u2014a boon to quick repairs. The [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]s of both [[brass instruments]] and, less commonly, [[woodwind]] instruments are often made of brass among other metals as well.\n\nNext to the [[brass instruments]], the most notable use of brass in music is in various [[percussion instrument]]s, most notably [[cymbal]]s, [[gong]]s, and [[chimes|orchestral (tubular) bells]] (large \"church\" [[bell]]s are normally made of [[bronze]]). Small [[handbell]]s and \"[[jingle bell]]\" are also commonly made of brass.\n\nThe [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the [[reed pipe|shallot]] (or beat \"through\" the shallot in the case of a \"free\" reed). Although not part of the brass section, [[snare drum]]s are also sometimes made of brass. Some parts on [[electric guitars]] are also made from brass, especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties, and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction.\n\n==Germicidal and antimicrobial applications==\n{{Main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\n\n{{See also|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}\n\nThe [[bactericidal]] properties of brass have been observed for centuries, particularly in marine environments where it prevents [[biofouling]]. Depending upon the type and concentration of [[pathogen]]s and the medium they are in, brass kills these [[microorganism]]s within a few minutes to hours of contact.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=r6/><ref name=r7/>\n\nA large number of independent studies<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=r6/><ref name=r7/><ref name=r1/><ref name=r10/><ref name=r20/><ref name=r25/> confirm this antimicrobial effect, even against antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA and VRSA.

The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[British Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.\n\n==Brass types==\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Cu Zn.svg|thumb|right|400px|Binary phase diagram]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! colspan=2 | Proportion by weight (%)\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n!

''2000 Years of Zinc and Brass'' London: British Museum p. 73</ref> However other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the [[Islamic]] and [[Byzantine]] world.<ref name=r4/> Conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in Western Europe during this period in favour of [[gunmetal]]s and other mixed alloys<ref>Bayley 1990, p. 22</ref> but by about 1000 brass artefacts are found in [[Scandinavia]]n graves in [[Scotland]],<ref name=r24/> brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in [[Northumbria]]<ref>Gilmore, G.R. and Metcalf, D.M (1980) \"The alloy of the Northumbrian coinage in the mid-ninth century\" in Metcalf, D and Oddy, W. ''Metallurgy in Numismatics'' 1 pp. 83\u201398</ref> and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of [[calamine brass]] in Germany<ref>Rehren 1999</ref> and [[The Low Countries]],<ref>Day 1990, pp. 123\u2013150</ref> areas rich in [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]] ore.\n\nThese places would remain important centres of brass making throughout the [[medieval]] period,<ref>Day 1990, pp. 124\u201333</ref> especially [[Dinant]].  Brass objects are still collectively known as ''dinanderie'' in French.  The [[baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] in modern [[Belgium]] (before 1117) is an outstanding masterpiece of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] brass casting, though also often described as bronze.  The metal of the early 12th-century [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is unusual even by medieval standards in being a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, [[nickel]], iron, [[antimony]] and [[arsenic]] with an unusually large amount of [[silver]], ranging from 22.5% in the base to 5.76% in the pan below the candle.  The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins, probably Late Roman.<ref>Noel Stratford, pp. 232, 245, in Zarnecki, George and others; ''English Romanesque Art, 1066\u20131200'', 1984, Arts Council of Great Britain, {{ISBN|0728703866}}</ref>  [[Latten]] is a term for decorative borders and similar objects cut from sheet metal, whether of brass or bronze.  [[Aquamanile]]s were typically made in brass in both the European and Islamic worlds.\n[[File:WLA lacma 1250 Aquamanile.jpg|thumb|left|Brass [[aquamanile]] from [[Lower Saxony]], Germany, c. 1250]]\n\nThe cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both Europe and the [[Islamic world]] seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took place in open-topped crucibles.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, pp. 224\u20135</ref> Islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as ''tutiya'' or [[tutty]] rather than zinc ores for brass-making, resulting in a metal with lower [[iron]] impurities.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, 78</ref> A number of Islamic writers and the 13th century [[Italians|Italian]] [[Marco Polo]] describe how this was obtained by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] from zinc ores and [[Condensation|condensed]] onto [[clay]] or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at [[Hindu Kush|Kush]] in Iran.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, pp. 73\u20136</ref> It could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Ab\u016b Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamd\u0101n\u012b|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 75</ref> The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisin]]s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.<ref>Craddock et al. 1990, p. 76</ref>\n\nIn Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.<ref>Rehren, T (1999) \"The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe\" in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp. 252\u20137</ref> The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226</ref> Albertus Magnus noted that the \"power\" of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 176\u20138</ref> \nGerman brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 173\u20135</ref>\n\n===Brass in Africa===\n[[File:Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG|thumb|upright|12th century \"[[Bronze Head from Ife]]\", actually of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\"]]\nSome of the most famous objects in [[African art]] are the [[lost wax]] castings of West Africa, mostly from what is now [[Nigeria]], produced first by the [[Kingdom of Ife]] and then the [[Benin Empire]].  Though normally described as \"bronzes\", the [[Benin Bronzes]], now mostly in the [[British Museum]] and other Western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the [[Bronze Head from Ife]] of \"heavily leaded zinc-brass\" and the [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], both also British Museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=618380 \"The Ife Head\"] on the British Museum collection database. Accessed 26 May 2014</ref>  Work in brass or bronze continued to be important in [[Benin art]] and other West African traditions such as [[Akan goldweights]], where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in Europe.\n\n===Brass making in Renaissance and post-medieval Europe===\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 95\u2013111</ref> These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&nbsp;kg of brass.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 105\u20136</ref> There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggests that this was a lower temperature, not entirely liquid, process.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 103</ref> The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 104</ref> Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 100</ref>\n\n16th-century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181\u20132, de Ruette 1995</ref> Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace. By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingot]]s from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198</ref>\n\nEventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloy]]ed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering,<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\">Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228</ref> and by 1657 the German chemist [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was \"nothing else but unmeltable zinc\" and that zinc was a \"half ripe metal.\"<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198\u20139</ref> However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from England may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar to those found in some zinc ingots from China.<ref name=\"Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228\"/>\n \nHowever, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900\u2013950&nbsp;\u00b0C and lasting up to 10 hours.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226\u20137.</ref> The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of [[battery wares]].<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\">Day 1990, p. 131</ref> By 1559 the Germany city of [[Aachen]] alone was capable of producing 300,000 [[centum weight|cwt]] of brass per year.<ref name=\"Day 1990, 131\"/> After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper [[smelted]] in the new [[coal]] fired [[reverberatory furnace]].<ref>Day 1991, pp. 135\u201344</ref> In 1723 [[Bristol]] brass maker [[Nehemiah Champion]] patented the use of [[granulated]] copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water.<ref>Day 1990, p. 138</ref> This increased the [[surface area]] of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 227</ref>\n\nIn 1738 Nehemiah's son [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a technique for the first industrial scale [[distillation]] of metallic zinc known as ''distillation per descencum'' or \"the English process\".<ref>Day 1991, pp. 179\u201381</ref><ref name=r3/> This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as [[scientific instruments]], [[clock]]s, brass [[buttons]] and [[costume jewellery]].<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\">Day 1991, p. 183</ref> However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass<ref name=\"Day 1991, 183\"/> and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at [[Warmley]].<ref name=r2/> By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as [[John-Jaques Dony]]'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc<ref>Day 1991, pp. 186\u20139</ref> as well as demand for [[corrosion]]-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.<ref>Day 1991, pp. 192\u20133, Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.

The town got small privileges as a merchant town (''[[k\u00f6ping]]'') shortly thereafter, which seems to have made it expand, because it is documented to have gotten a charter in 1676 by King [[Charles XI of Sweden]], although some documents show it was already considered a city in 1672. As it was the seat for a merchant navy, the coat of arms was designed with such a ship, and has remained that way even after the use of sailing ships was discontinued in the 19th century.\n\nThe city was a seat for Sweden's warfare against the [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegians]], and more than once it was conquered and reconquered throughout the centuries. The warlike King [[Charles XII of Sweden]], for instance, used it as his outpost for his campaign against Norway in 1716\u20131718.\n\nAt the time it had a population of 300 inhabitants. But soon the fishing blossomed, and its population increased to 1,100 by 1805. The late 18th century also saw the spa and bathing attract visitors, a position it kept throughout the 19th century. In 1786 Sweden's first hot baths were opened in the city. By 1917, its population was 2,949 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Kostersundet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Koster Islands]] are surrounded by [[Kosterhavet National Park]].]]\nThe municipality of [[Str\u00f6mstad Municipality|Str\u00f6mstad]] is located in the [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] province of [[V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County]] in western Sweden. It has an international border to Norway near [[Svinesund]] in the north. It has a total area of 472&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and is a coastal municipality. Str\u00f6mstad is the administrative centre of the municipality, while minor towns include [[Skee, Sweden|Skee]], [[Kebal]], and [[Svinesund]]. [[European route E6]] traverses the municipality. Str\u00f6mstad is the home of the [[Koster Islands]].<ref name=\"snl.no\"/> This archipelago consists of two main islands: North Koster (3.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and South Koster (7.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The islands are popular tourist destinations and the rural South Koster brags one of western Sweden's largest sandy beaches. The nearby [[Kosterhavet National Park]] is home to the country's largest seal colony. The islands are home to many vacation homes and various hotels. They are Sweden's westernmost populated islands.<ref>Proctor, James (2014). ''West Sweden''. Bradt Travel Guides.

The town got small privileges as a merchant town (''[[k\u00f6ping]]'') shortly thereafter, which seems to have made it expand, because it is documented to have gotten a charter in 1676 by King [[Charles XI of Sweden]], although some documents show it was already considered a city in 1672. As it was the seat for a merchant navy, the coat of arms was designed with such a ship, and has remained that way even after the use of sailing ships was discontinued in the 19th century.\n\nThe city was a seat for Sweden's warfare against the [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegians]], and more than once it was conquered and reconquered throughout the centuries. The warlike King [[Charles XII of Sweden]], for instance, used it as his outpost for his campaign against Norway in 1716\u20131718.\n\nAt the time it had a population of 300 inhabitants. But soon the fishing blossomed, and its population increased to 1,100 by 1805. The late 18th century also saw the spa and bathing attract visitors, a position it kept throughout the 19th century. In 1786 Swedens first hot baths was opened in the city .By 1917, its population was 2,949 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Kostersundet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Koster Islands]] are surrounded by [[Kosterhavet National Park]].]]\nThe municipality of [[Str\u00f6mstad Municipality|Str\u00f6mstad]] is located in the [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] province of [[V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County]] in western Sweden.

{"title_page": "Regular and irregular verbs", "text_new": "{{Short description|no verbs by regularity of inflection}}{{hat note|For informati jojo sows specific to the English language, see [[English verbs]] and [[English irregular verbs]].}}\nA '''regular verb''' is any [[verb]] whose [[Verb conjugation|conjugation]] follows the typical pattern, or one of the typical patterns, of the language to which it belongs. A verb whose conjugation follows a different pattern is called an '''irregular verb'''. (This is one instance of the distinction between [[regular inflection|regular and irregular inflection]], which can also apply to other word classes, such as nouns and adjectives). \n\nIn [[English verbs|English]], for example, verbs such as ''play'', ''enter'', and ''like'' are regular since they form their inflected parts by adding the typical endings ''-s'', ''-ing'' and ''-ed'' to give forms such as ''plays'', ''entering'', and ''liked''. On the other hand, verbs such as ''drink'', ''hit'' and ''have'' are irregular since some of their parts are not made according to the typical pattern: ''drank'' and ''drunk'' (not \"drinked\"); ''hit'' (as [[past tense]] and [[past participle]], not \"hitted\") and ''has'' and ''had'' (not \"haves\" and \"haved\").\n\nThe classification of verbs as regular or irregular is to some extent a subjective matter. If some conjugational [[inflectional paradigm|paradigm]] in a language is followed by a limited number of verbs, or it requires the specification of more than one [[principal parts|principal part]] (as with the [[German verbs|German strong verbs]]), views may differ as to whether the verbs in question should be considered irregular. Most inflectional irregularities arise as a result of series of fairly uniform historical changes so forms that appear to be irregular from a [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] (contemporary) point of view may be seen as following more regular patterns when the verbs are analyzed from a diachronic ([[historical linguistics|historical linguistic]]) viewpoint.\n\n==Development==\nWhen a language develops some type of [[inflection]], such as verb [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], it normally produces certain typical (regular) patterns by which words in the given [[word class|class]] come to make their inflected forms. The language may develop a number of different regular patterns, either as a result of conditional [[sound change]]s which cause differentiation within a single pattern, or through patterns with different derivations coming to be used for the same purpose. An example of the latter is provided by the strong and [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] verbs of the [[Germanic languages]]; the strong verbs inherited their method of making past forms (vowel [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]) from [[Proto-Indo-European]], while for the weak verbs a different method (addition of [[dental consonant|dental]] suffixes) developed.\n\nIrregularities in verb conjugation (and other [[regular inflection|inflectional irregularities]]) may arise in various ways. Sometimes the result of multiple conditional and selective historical sound changes is to leave certain words following a practically unpredictable pattern. This has happened with the strong verbs (and some groups of weak verbs) in English; patterns such as ''sing\u2013sang\u2013sung'' and ''stand\u2013stood\u2013stood'', although they derive from what were more or less regular patterns in older languages, are now peculiar to a single verb or small group of verbs in each case, and are viewed as irregular.\n\nIrregularities may also arise from [[suppletion]] \u2013 forms of one verb may be taken over and used as forms of another. This has happened in the case of the English word ''went'', which was originally the past tense of ''wend'', but has come to be used instead as the past tense of ''go''. The verb ''be'' also has a number of suppletive forms (''be'', ''is'', ''was'', etc., with various different origins) \u2013 this is common for [[Indo-European copula|copular verbs]] in Indo-European languages.\n\nThe regularity and irregularity of verbs is affected by changes taking place by way of [[analogy]] \u2013 there is often a tendency for verbs to switch to a different, usually more regular, pattern under the influence of other verbs. This is less likely when the existing forms are very familiar through common use \u2013 hence among the most common verbs in a language (like ''be'', ''have'', ''go'', etc.) there is often a greater incidence of irregularity. (Analogy can occasionally work the other way, too \u2013 some [[English irregular verbs|irregular English verb forms]] such as ''shown'', ''caught'' and ''spat'' have arisen through the influence of existing strong or irregular verbs.)\n\n==Types of pattern==\nThe most straightforward type of regular verb conjugation pattern involves a single class of verbs, a single [[principal part]] (the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or one particular conjugated form), and a set of exact rules which produce, from that principal part, each of the remaining forms in the verb's [[inflectional paradigm|paradigm]]. This is generally considered to be the situation with regular [[English verbs]] \u2013 from the one principal part, namely the plain form of a regular verb (the bare [[infinitive]], such as ''play'', ''happen'', ''skim'', ''interchange'', etc.), all the other inflected forms (which in English are not numerous; they consist of the third person singular [[present tense]], the [[past tense]] and [[past participle]], and the [[-ing|present participle/gerund]] form) can be derived by way of consistent rules. These rules involve the addition of inflectional endings (''-s'', ''-[e]d'', ''-ing''), together with certain [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] rules about how those endings are pronounced, and certain rules of spelling (such as the doubling of certain consonants). Verbs which in any way deviate from these rules (there are [[English irregular verbs|around 200]] such verbs in the language) are classed as irregular.\n\nA language may have more than one regular conjugation pattern. [[French verbs]], for example, follow different patterns depending on whether their infinitive ends in ''-er'', ''-ir'' or ''-re'' (complicated slightly by certain rules of spelling). A verb which does not follow the expected pattern based on the form of its infinitive is considered irregular.\n\nIn some languages, however, verbs may be considered regular even if the specification of one of their forms is not sufficient to predict all of the rest; they have more than one principal part. In [[Latin]], for example, verbs are considered to have four principal parts (see [[Latin conjugation]] for details). Specification of all of these four forms for a given verb is sufficient to predict all of the other forms of that verb \u2013 except in a few cases, when the verb is irregular.\n\nTo some extent it may be a matter of convention or subjective preference to state whether a verb is regular or irregular. In English, for example, if a verb is allowed to have three principal parts specified (the bare infinitive, past tense and past participle), then the number of irregular verbs will be drastically reduced (this is not the conventional approach, however). The situation is similar with the strong verbs in [[German verbs|German]] (these may or may not be described as irregular). In French, what are traditionally called the \"regular ''-re'' verbs\" (those that conjugate like ''vendre'') are not in fact particularly numerous, and may alternatively be considered to be just another group of similarly behaving irregular verbs. The most unambiguously irregular verbs are often very commonly used verbs such as the [[copular verb]] ''be'' in English and its equivalents in other languages, which frequently have a variety of [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms and thus follow an exceptionally unpredictable pattern of conjugation.\n\n===Irregularity in spelling only===\nIt is possible for a verb to be regular in pronunciation, but irregular in [[spelling]]. Examples of this are the English verbs ''lay'' and ''pay''. In terms of pronunciation, these make their past forms in the regular way, by adding the {{IPA|/d/}} sound. However their spelling deviates from the regular pattern: they are not spelt (spelled) \"layed\" and \"payed\" (although the latter form is used in some e.g. nautical contexts as \"the sailor payed out the anchor chain\"), but ''laid'' and ''paid''. This contrasts with fully regular verbs such as ''sway'' and ''stay'', which have the regularly spelt past forms ''swayed'' and ''stayed''. The English present participle is never irregular in pronunciation, with the exception that ''singeing'' irregularly retains the ''e'' to distinguish it from ''singing''.\n\n==Linguistic study==\nIn linguistic analysis, the concept of regular and irregular verbs (and other types of [[regular inflection|regular and irregular inflection]]) commonly arises in [[psycholinguistics]], and in particular in work related to [[language acquisition]]. In studies of first language acquisition (where the aim is to establish how the human brain processes its native language), one debate among 20th-century linguists revolved around whether small children learn all verb forms as separate pieces of vocabulary or whether they deduce forms by the application of rules.<ref>[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. ''[[Words and Rules]]: The Ingredients of Language'', 1999. {{ISBN|0-06-095840-5}}.</ref> Since a child can hear a regular verb for the first time and immediately reuse it correctly in a different conjugated form which he or she has never heard, it is clear that the brain does work with rules; but irregular verbs must be processed differently. A common error for small children is to conjugate irregular verbs as though they were regular, which is taken as evidence that we learn and process our native language partly by the application of rules, rather than, as some earlier scholarship had postulated, solely by learning the forms. In fact, children often use the most common irregular verbs correctly in their earliest utterances but then switch to incorrect regular forms for a time when they begin to operate systematically. That allows a fairly precise analysis of the phases of this aspect of first language acquisition.\n\nRegular and irregular verbs are also of significance in [[second language acquisition]], and in particular in [[language teaching]] and formal learning, where rules such as verb paradigms are defined, and exceptions (such as irregular verbs) need to be listed and learned explicitly. The importance of irregular verbs is enhanced by the fact that they often include the most commonly used verbs in the language (including verbs such as ''be'' and ''have'' in English, their equivalents ''\u00eatre'' and ''avoir'' in [[French verbs|French]], ''sein'' and ''haben'' in [[German verbs|German]], etc.).\n\nIn [[historical linguistics]] the concept of irregular verbs is not so commonly referenced. Since most irregularities can be explained by processes of historical language development, these verbs are only irregular when viewed [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]]; they often appear regular when seen in their historical context. In the study of [[Germanic verb]]s, for example, historical linguists generally distinguish between strong and weak verbs, rather than irregular and regular (although occasional irregularities still arise even in this approach).\n\nWhen languages are being compared informally, one of the few quantitative statistics which are sometimes cited is the number of irregular verbs. These counts are not particularly accurate for a wide variety of reasons, and academic linguists are reluctant to cite them. But it does seem that some languages have a greater tolerance for paradigm irregularity than others.\n\n==By language==\n===English===\nWith the exception of the highly irregular verb [[to be|''be'']], an English verb can have up to five forms: its plain form (or bare [[infinitive]]), a third person singular [[present tense]], a [[past tense]] (or [[preterite]]), a [[past participle]], and the ''[[-ing]]'' form that serves as both a [[present participle]] and [[gerund]].\n\nThe rules for the formation of the inflected parts of ''regular'' verbs are given in detail in the article on [[English verbs]]. In summary they are as follows:\n*The third person singular present tense is formed by adding the ending '''''-s''''' (or ''-es'' after certain letters) to the plain form. When the plain form ends with the letter ''-y'' following a consonant, this becomes ''-ies''. The ending is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} after a [[voiceless consonant]] sound (as in ''hops'', ''halts'', ''packs'', ''bluffs'', ''laughs''), or {{IPA|/z/}} after a voiced consonant or vowel sound (as in ''robs'', ''lends'', ''begs'', ''sings'', ''thaws'', ''flies'', ''sighs''), but {{IPA|/\u026az/}} after a [[sibilant]] (''passes'', ''pushes'', ''marches'').\n*The past tense and past participle are identical; they are formed with the ending '''''-ed''''', which as in the previous case has three different pronunciations ({{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u026ad/}}). Certain spelling rules apply, including the doubling of consonants before the ending in forms like ''conned'' and ''preferred''. There is some variation in the application of these spelling rules with some rarer verbs, and particularly with verbs ending ''-c'' (''panic\u2013panicked'', ''zinc\u2013zinc(k)ed'', ''arc\u2013arced'', etc.), meaning that these forms are not fully predictable, but such verbs are not normally listed among the irregular ones. (The verbs ''lay'' and ''pay'', however, are commonly listed as irregular, despite being regular in terms of pronunciation \u2013 their past forms have the anomalous spellings ''laid'' and ''paid''.)\n*The present participle/gerund is formed by adding '''''-ing''''', again with the application of certain spelling rules similar to those that apply with ''-ed''.\n\nThe irregular verbs of English are described and listed in the article [[English irregular verbs]] (for a more extensive list, see [[List of English irregular verbs]]). In the case of these:\n*The third person singular present tense is formed regularly, except in the case of the [[English modal verbs|modal verbs]] (''can'', ''shall'', etc.) which do not add ''-s'', the verb [[to be|''be'']] (which has three present indicative forms: ''am'', ''is'' and ''are''), and the three verbs ''have'', ''do'' and ''say'', which produce the forms ''has'', ''does'' (pronounced with a short vowel, {{IPA|/d\u028cz/}}), and ''says'' (pronounced with a short vowel, {{IPA|/s\u025bz/}}).<ref>[http://oaadonline.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/say say - Definition and pronunciation &#124; Oxford Advanced American Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com]</ref>\n*The past tense and past participle forms are the forms most commonly made in irregular fashion. About 200 verbs in normal use have irregularities in one or other (or usually both) of these forms. They may derive from [[Germanic strong verbs]], as with ''sing\u2013sang\u2013sung'' or ''rise\u2013rose\u2013risen'', or from weak verbs which have come to deviate from the standard pattern in some way (''teach\u2013taught\u2013taught'', ''keep\u2013kept\u2013kept'', ''build\u2013built\u2013built'', etc.). (The past participle often ends in \"n\", \" d\" or \"ed\".) The past and past participle forms change in spelling sometimes.\n*The present participle/gerund is formed regularly, in ''-ing'' (except for those [[defective verbs]], such as the modals, which lack such a form).\n\n==== Common irregular verbs====\nSome examples of common irregular verbs in English, other than modals, are:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Bedford Handbook|last=Hacker|first=Diana|publisher=curriculum solutions|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=343-344}}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* arise\n* be\n* come\n* do\n* eat\n* fall\n* get\n* give\n* go\n* have\n* hear\n* know\n* lend\n* make\n* run\n* say\n* see\n* take\n* think\n* wear\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Other languages===\nFor regular and irregular verbs in other languages, see the articles on the grammars of those languages.

Artificial [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]] usually have a single regular pattern for all verbs (as well as other [[part of speech|parts of speech]]) as a matter of design, because inflectional irregularities are considered to increase the difficulty of learning and using a language. Other [[constructed language]]s, however, need not show such regularity, especially if they are designed to look similar to natural ones.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*Germanic languages\n**[http://www.verbbusters.com/vsearch.php English Irregular Verb Search] English Irregular Verb Search\n**[http://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/grammar/unreg_verben2.htm Learn English verbs effectively] <!-- Is this an appropriate link?

A verb whose conjugation follows a different pattern is called an '''irregular verb'''. (This is one instance of the distinction between [[regular inflection|regular and irregular inflection]], which can also apply to other word classes, such as nouns and adjectives). \n\nIn [[English verbs|English]], for example, verbs such as ''play'', ''enter'', and ''like'' are regular since they form their inflected parts by adding the typical endings ''-s'', ''-ing'' and ''-ed'' to give forms such as ''plays'', ''entering'', and ''liked''. On the other hand, verbs such as ''drink'', ''hit'' and ''have'' are irregular since some of their parts are not made according to the typical pattern: ''drank'' and ''drunk'' (not \"drinked\"); ''hit'' (as [[past tense]] and [[past participle]], not \"hitted\") and ''has'' and ''had'' (not \"haves\" and \"haved\").\n\nThe classification of verbs as regular or irregular is to some extent a subjective matter. If some conjugational [[inflectional paradigm|paradigm]] in a language is followed by a limited number of verbs, or it requires the specification of more than one [[principal parts|principal part]] (as with the [[German verbs|German strong verbs]]), views may differ as to whether the verbs in question should be considered irregular. Most inflectional irregularities arise as a result of series of fairly uniform historical changes so forms that appear to be irregular from a [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] (contemporary) point of view may be seen as following more regular patterns when the verbs are analyzed from a diachronic ([[historical linguistics|historical linguistic]]) viewpoint.\n\n==Development==\nWhen a language develops some type of [[inflection]], such as verb [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], it normally produces certain typical (regular) patterns by which words in the given [[word class|class]] come to make their inflected forms. The language may develop a number of different regular patterns, either as a result of conditional [[sound change]]s which cause differentiation within a single pattern, or through patterns with different derivations coming to be used for the same purpose. An example of the latter is provided by the strong and [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] verbs of the [[Germanic languages]]; the strong verbs inherited their method of making past forms (vowel [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]) from [[Proto-Indo-European]], while for the weak verbs a different method (addition of [[dental consonant|dental]] suffixes) developed.\n\nIrregularities in verb conjugation (and other [[regular inflection|inflectional irregularities]]) may arise in various ways. Sometimes the result of multiple conditional and selective historical sound changes is to leave certain words following a practically unpredictable pattern. This has happened with the strong verbs (and some groups of weak verbs) in English; patterns such as ''sing\u2013sang\u2013sung'' and ''stand\u2013stood\u2013stood'', although they derive from what were more or less regular patterns in older languages, are now peculiar to a single verb or small group of verbs in each case, and are viewed as irregular.\n\nIrregularities may also arise from [[suppletion]] \u2013 forms of one verb may be taken over and used as forms of another. This has happened in the case of the English word ''went'', which was originally the past tense of ''wend'', but has come to be used instead as the past tense of ''go''. The verb ''be'' also has a number of suppletive forms (''be'', ''is'', ''was'', etc., with various different origins) \u2013 this is common for [[Indo-European copula|copular verbs]] in Indo-European languages.\n\nThe regularity and irregularity of verbs is affected by changes taking place by way of [[analogy]] \u2013 there is often a tendency for verbs to switch to a different, usually more regular, pattern under the influence of other verbs. This is less likely when the existing forms are very familiar through common use \u2013 hence among the most common verbs in a language (like ''be'', ''have'', ''go'', etc.) there is often a greater incidence of irregularity. (Analogy can occasionally work the other way, too \u2013 some [[English irregular verbs|irregular English verb forms]] such as ''shown'', ''caught'' and ''spat'' have arisen through the influence of existing strong or irregular verbs.)\n\n==Types of pattern==\nThe most straightforward type of regular verb conjugation pattern involves a single class of verbs, a single [[principal part]] (the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or one particular conjugated form), and a set of exact rules which produce, from that principal part, each of the remaining forms in the verb's [[inflectional paradigm|paradigm]]. This is generally considered to be the situation with regular [[English verbs]] \u2013 from the one principal part, namely the plain form of a regular verb (the bare [[infinitive]], such as ''play'', ''happen'', ''skim'', ''interchange'', etc.), all the other inflected forms (which in English are not numerous; they consist of the third person singular [[present tense]], the [[past tense]] and [[past participle]], and the [[-ing|present participle/gerund]] form) can be derived by way of consistent rules. These rules involve the addition of inflectional endings (''-s'', ''-[e]d'', ''-ing''), together with certain [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] rules about how those endings are pronounced, and certain rules of spelling (such as the doubling of certain consonants). Verbs which in any way deviate from these rules (there are [[English irregular verbs|around 200]] such verbs in the language) are classed as irregular.\n\nA language may have more than one regular conjugation pattern. [[French verbs]], for example, follow different patterns depending on whether their infinitive ends in ''-er'', ''-ir'' or ''-re'' (complicated slightly by certain rules of spelling). A verb which does not follow the expected pattern based on the form of its infinitive is considered irregular.\n\nIn some languages, however, verbs may be considered regular even if the specification of one of their forms is not sufficient to predict all of the rest; they have more than one principal part. In [[Latin]], for example, verbs are considered to have four principal parts (see [[Latin conjugation]] for details). Specification of all of these four forms for a given verb is sufficient to predict all of the other forms of that verb \u2013 except in a few cases, when the verb is irregular.\n\nTo some extent it may be a matter of convention or subjective preference to state whether a verb is regular or irregular. In English, for example, if a verb is allowed to have three principal parts specified (the bare infinitive, past tense and past participle), then the number of irregular verbs will be drastically reduced (this is not the conventional approach, however). The situation is similar with the strong verbs in [[German verbs|German]] (these may or may not be described as irregular). In French, what are traditionally called the \"regular ''-re'' verbs\" (those that conjugate like ''vendre'') are not in fact particularly numerous, and may alternatively be considered to be just another group of similarly behaving irregular verbs. The most unambiguously irregular verbs are often very commonly used verbs such as the [[copular verb]] ''be'' in English and its equivalents in other languages, which frequently have a variety of [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms and thus follow an exceptionally unpredictable pattern of conjugation.\n\n===Irregularity in spelling only===\nIt is possible for a verb to be regular in pronunciation, but irregular in [[spelling]]. Examples of this are the English verbs ''lay'' and ''pay''. In terms of pronunciation, these make their past forms in the regular way, by adding the {{IPA|/d/}} sound. However their spelling deviates from the regular pattern: they are not spelt (spelled) \"layed\" and \"payed\" (although the latter form is used in some e.g. nautical contexts as \"the sailor payed out the anchor chain\"), but ''laid'' and ''paid''. This contrasts with fully regular verbs such as ''sway'' and ''stay'', which have the regularly spelt past forms ''swayed'' and ''stayed''. The English present participle is never irregular in pronunciation, with the exception that ''singeing'' irregularly retains the ''e'' to distinguish it from ''singing''.\n\n==Linguistic study==\nIn linguistic analysis, the concept of regular and irregular verbs (and other types of [[regular inflection|regular and irregular inflection]]) commonly arises in [[psycholinguistics]], and in particular in work related to [[language acquisition]]. In studies of first language acquisition (where the aim is to establish how the human brain processes its native language), one debate among 20th-century linguists revolved around whether small children learn all verb forms as separate pieces of vocabulary or whether they deduce forms by the application of rules.<ref>[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]].

dominant party in the [[Pan-Green Coalition]].\n\nFounded in 1986, the DPP is one of two [[Major party|major parties]] in Taiwan, along with the historically dominant [[Kuomintang]]. It has traditionally been associated with strong advocacy of [[human rights]], [[anti-communism]], and a distinct [[Taiwanese identity]]. The incumbent President and former leader of the DPP, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], is the second member of the DPP to hold the office.<ref name=\"chinapost.com.tw\">[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/presidential-election/2012/01/14/329044/Tsai-steps.htm \"Tsai steps down as DPP chair after defeat in presidential poll\"] (14 January 2012). ''The China Post''. Retrieved 6 April 2018.</ref>\n\nThe DPP is a long-term member of [[Liberal International]] and a founding member of the [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]]. It represented Taiwan in the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]]. The DPP and its affiliated parties are widely classified as [[socially liberal]] because of their strong support for human rights, including support for [[gender equality]], but they also advocate [[economic liberalism]] and a [[Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwanese national identity]]. In addition, the DPP is more willing to increase military expenditures, with foreign policy on closer ties with the United States and Japan.\n\n==History==\nThe DPP's roots were in opposition to the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]]. It was founded as the [[Tangwai]] \u2013 or \"outside-the-KMT\" \u2013 movement. This movement culminated in the formation of the DPP as an alternative party on 28 September 1986 when eighteen founding members met at [[Grand Hotel (Taipei)|Grand Hotel Taipei]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lu|first1=Lu Hsin-hui|last2=Kuo|first2=Chung-han|title=DPP should clarify its cross-strait policy: founding member|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201609280026.aspx|accessdate=29 September 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=28 September 2016}}</ref> A total of 132 people joined the party that day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Li-hua|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=DPP members say party must discuss core values|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/09/30/2003656223|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=30 September 2016}}</ref> The new party contested the [[1986 Taiwan legislative election|1986 election]] as \"nonpartisan\" when competing parties remained illegal under national law until the following year. The first members of the party drew heavily from the ranks of family members and defense lawyers of political prisoners as well as intellectuals and artists who had spent time abroad. Such individuals were strongly committed to political change that would ensure constitutional support in Republic of China's freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. The party did not at the outset give open support to an independent Republic of China's national identity \u2013 a move that could have invited a violent crackdown by the Republic of China's Kuomintang rulers. Its platform was pro-environment and pro-democracy. As more and more of its demands were met during the 1990s \u2013 such as the [[direct popular election]] of Republic of China's [[president of the Republic of China|president]] and all representatives in its [[Legislative Yuan]], and open discussion of Republic of China's repressive past as represented in the [[February 28 Incident]] and its long [[martial law]] aftermath \u2013 a greater variety of views could be advocated in the more liberal political atmosphere. Party members began openly promoting a national identity for Taiwan separate from China. The DPP doctrine also supported reform of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] to change the name of Republic of China to \"Republic of Taiwan\", though the DPP never aimed to amend the Constitution through a referendum.\n\nOnce the DPP had representation in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (LY, or Parliament), the party used the legislature as a forum to challenge the government. However, it did not emerge as a formidable force until 1991, when the elderly LY members elected from [[mainland China]] provinces in 1948 retired. As the major opposition in the LY, the DPP worked with then-President [[Lee Teng-hui]], the then-leader of KMT, to push through a series of amendments to transfer into a [[semi-presidential system]] (for example, Republic of China's [[premier of the Republic of China|premier]] would no longer have to be confirmed by the LY). Among the electoral reforms, a [[party-list proportional representation|PR list]] was adopted and aboriginal seats in the LY created.\n\n===2000\u20132008: in minority government===\n[[File:Chen Shui-bian from VOA.jpg|thumb|right|Former President Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2000-2008)]]\n[[File:DPP-Taiwan-old.svg|thumb|right|Old DPP logo]]\nThe DPP won the presidency with the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|election]] of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in March 2000 with a plurality, due to [[Pan-Blue]] voters splitting their vote between the Kuomintang and independent candidate [[James Soong]], ending 91 years of KMT rule in the Republic of China. Chen softened the party's stance on independence to appeal to moderate voters, appease the United States, and placate China. He also promised not to [[Four Noes and One Without|change the ROC state symbols or declare formal independence]] as long as the [[China|People's Republic of China]] did not attack Taiwan.\n\nThe DPP became the largest party having reached a plurality in the Legislative Yuan for the first time in 2002 following the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|2001 legislative election]]. However, a majority coalition between the KMT, [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] prevented it from taking control of the chamber.\n\nIn 2004, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow margin. He and Vice President [[Annette Lu]] had been involved in an assassination attempt only hours before the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|election]]. The KMT candidate, [[Lien Chan]], demanded a recount the following morning. A judicial recount under the jurisdiction of a special panel of the High Court began on 10 May 2004 and ended on 18 May 2004. It was conducted by about 460 teams situated in 21 courthouses across the Taiwan area. Each team had seven members \u2013 one judge, two members each from the district court and the local government election authorities and two witnesses each representing the plaintiff ([[Pan-Blue Coalition]]) and the defendant ([[Pan-Green Coalition]]). Disputed votes were sent to High Court in Taipei for verification. After the recount, President Chen was confirmed the winner of the election by a smaller margin (25,563 as opposed to 29,518 originally). In the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|later legislative election]], the Pan-Blue Coalition opposition retained control of the chamber.\n\nThe DPP suffered a significant election defeat in nationwide [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|local and county elections in December 2005]]. The pan-blue coalition captured 16 of 23 county and city government offices under the leadership of popular [[Taipei]] mayor and KMT Party Chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]].\n\nThe results led to a shake up of the party leadership. [[Su Tseng-chang]] resigned as DPP chairman soon after election results were announced. Su had pledged to step down if the DPP lost either Taipei County or failed to win 10 of the 23 mayor/magistrate positions. Vice President [[Annette Lu]] was appointed acting DPP leader. Presidential Office Secretary-General [[Yu Shyi-kun]] was elected in a [[2006 Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship election|three-way race]] against legislator [[Chai Trong-rong]] and [[Wong Chin-chu]] with 54.4% of the vote.\n\nPremier [[Frank Hsieh]], DPP election organizer and former mayor of [[Kaohsiung]] twice tendered a verbal resignation immediately following the election, but his resignation was not accepted by President Chen until 17 January 2006 after the DPP chairmanship election had concluded. The former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang was appointed to replace Hsieh as premier. Hsieh and his cabinet resigned en masse on January 24 to make way for Su and his new cabinet. President Chen had offered the position of Presidential Office Secretary-General (vacated by Su) to the departing premier, but Hsieh declined and left office criticizing President Chen for his tough line on dealing with China.\n\n====Separate identity====\nOn 30 September 2007, the DPP approved a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"normal nation\". It struck an accommodating tone by advocating general use of \"[[Taiwan]]\" as the country's name without calling for abandonment of the name Republic of China.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm AP, Republic of China Party Asserts Separate Identity]</ref>\n\n[[File:\u8521\u82f1\u6587\u5b98\u65b9\u5143\u9996\u8096\u50cf\u7167.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Tsai Ing-wen]], the second DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2016-present) and the leader of the DPP since 2008, she is the first female leader of the DPP.]]\n===2008\u20132016: back to opposition===\nIn the national elections held in early months of 2008, the DPP won less than 25% of the seats (38.2% vote share) in the new Legislative Yuan while its presidential candidate, former [[Kaohsiung]] mayor [[Frank Hsieh]], lost to KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] by a wide margin (41.55% vs. 58.45%). In May, the DPP elected [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as the new leader, Tsai became the first female leader of the DPP and the first female leader to lead a major party in Taiwan.\n\nThe first months since backed to the opposition were dominated by press coverage of the travails of [[Chen Shui-bian]] and his wife [[Wu Shu-jen]]. On 15 August 2008, Chen resigned from the DPP and apologized: \"Today I have to say sorry to all of the DPP members and supporters. I let everyone down, caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations. My acts have caused irreparable damage to the party. I love the DPP deeply and am proud of being a DPP member. To express my deepest regrets to all DPP members and supporters, I announce my withdrawal from the DPP immediately. My wife Wu Shu-jen is also withdrawing from the party.\" DPP Chairperson followed with a public statement on behalf of the party: \"In regard to Chen and his wife's decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the party's anti-corruption committee, we respect his decision and accept it.\"<ref>[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/17/former-taiwan-president-resigns-from-party-over-corruption-charges pacificmagazine.net, Former Republic of China President Resigns From Party Over Corruption Charges]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe DPP vowed to reflect on public misgivings towards the party.

The DPP marked the anniversary with massive rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung. Tsai's address to the crowd in Taipei on May 17 proclaimed a \"citizens' movement to protect Republic of China\" seeking to \"protect our democracy and protect Republic of China.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dpptaiwan.wordpress.com/2009/05/17/tsai-ing-wens-opening-speech-at-the-517-rally/ | title=Tsai Ing-wen's Opening Speech at the 517 Rally| date=2009-05-17}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016\u2013present: in majority government ===\nOn [[2016 Taiwanese presidential election|16 January 2016]], Taiwan held a general election for its presidency and for the Legislative Yuan.

Furthermore, its platform includes a legal and political order based on human rights and democracy; balanced economic and financial administration; fair and open social welfare; educational and cultural reform; and, independent defence and peaceful foreign policy with closer ties to United States and Japan. For these reasons, it used to be considered a party of the [[center-left]] economically though its base consisted largely of the [[middle class]]. The party also has a [[social liberal]] stance that includes support for [[gender equality]] and [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|LGBT rights]] (the party have supported [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]] under Tsai's leadership), and also have a strong [[social conservative]] base, including support from the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]. Since the democratisation of Taiwan in the 1990s, the DPP has had its strongest performance in the [[Hokkien]]-speaking counties and cities of Taiwan, compared with the predominantly [[Hakka]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking counties, that tend to support the [[Kuomintang]].\n\nThe primary political axis in Taiwan involves the issue of [[Taiwan independence]] versus eventual [[Cross-Strait Unification|unification with China]]. Although the differences tend to be portrayed in polarized terms, both major coalitions have developed modified, nuanced and often complex positions. Though opposed in the philosophical origins, the practical differences between such positions can sometimes be subtle.\n\nThe current official position of the party is that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country whose territory consists of Taiwan and its surrounding smaller islands and whose sovereignty derives only from the ROC citizens living in Taiwan (similar philosophy of [[self-determination]]), based on the \"[[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]]\" in 1999. It considers Taiwan as an independent nation under the name of Republic of China, making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. The DPP rejects the so-called \"[[One China principle]]\" defined in 1992 as the basis for official diplomatic relations with the PRC and advocates a Taiwanese national identity which is separate from mainland China. The DPP argues that its efforts to promote a Taiwanese national identity are merely an effort to normalize a Taiwanese identity repressed during years of authoritarian Kuomintang rule. The DPP also differs from the KMT on foreign and defense policies in that the DPP considers relations with the United States, Japan, and European states, among other democratic countries, crucial for Taiwan's security.\n\nIn contrast, the KMT or pan-blue coalition agrees that the Republic of China is an independent and sovereign country that is not part of the PRC, but argues that a one China principle (with different definitions across the strait) can be used as the basis for talks with China. The KMT also opposes the purposes of Taiwan independence and argues that efforts to establish a Taiwanese national identity separated from the Chinese national identity are unnecessary and needlessly provocative. Some KMT conservative officials have called efforts from DPP \"[[anti-China]]\" (opposing migrants from mainland China, whom DPP officials did not recognize as Taiwanese, but Chinese). At the other end of the political spectrum, the acceptance by the DPP of the symbols of the Republic of China is opposed by the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\nThe first years of the DPP as the ruling party drew accusations from the opposition that, as a self-styled Taiwanese [[nationalism|nationalist]] party, the DPP was itself inadequately sensitive to the ethnographic diversity of Taiwan's population. Where the KMT had been guilty of Chinese [[chauvinism]], the critics charged, the DPP might offer nothing more as a remedy than [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] chauvinism.\n\nChina has maintained a hostile position toward the DPP. It has made some efforts to moderate its tone since passing its [[Anti-Secession Law]] in 2005 to prevent a popular backlash from Taiwan's voters. In 2008, China stated it was willing to negotiate with any party in Taiwan that \"accepts the so-called [[1992 consensus]]\" (the consensus agreed by the KMT and the Communist Party of China). The DPP denies the existence of the 1992 consensus between China and Taiwan and demands a greater democratic opening in China.\n\nThe deep-rooted hostility between [[Taiwanese aborigines]] and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the aboriginal communities effective KMT networks contribute to aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}</ref> Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the \"indigenization\" movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP's \"rectification\" by recognizing the Truku for political reasons, where the Atayal and Seediq slammed the Truku for their name rectification.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0t_CU9gmi8cC&pg=PA220&dq=truku&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P0QfVbq1MomWsAXRt4SADA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=truku&f=false ed.

It represented Taiwan in the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation]]. The DPP and its affiliated parties are widely classified as [[socially liberal]] because of their strong support for human rights, including support for [[gender equality]], but they also advocate [[economic liberalism]] and a [[Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwanese national identity]]. In addition, the DPP is more willing to increase military expenditures, with foreign policy on closer ties with the United States and Japan.\n\n==History==\nThe DPP's roots were in opposition to the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]]. It was founded as the [[Tangwai]] \u2013 or \"outside-the-KMT\" \u2013 movement.

The first members of the party drew heavily from the ranks of family members and defense lawyers of political prisoners as well as intellectuals and artists who had spent time abroad. Such individuals were strongly committed to political change that would ensure constitutional support in Republic of China's freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. The party did not at the outset give open support to an independent Republic of China's national identity \u2013 a move that could have invited a violent crackdown by the Republic of China's Kuomintang rulers. Its platform was pro-environment and pro-democracy. As more and more of its demands were met during the 1990s \u2013 such as the [[direct popular election]] of Republic of China's [[president of the Republic of China|president]] and all representatives in its [[Legislative Yuan]], and open discussion of Republic of China's repressive past as represented in the [[February 28 Incident]] and its long [[martial law]] aftermath \u2013 a greater variety of views could be advocated in the more liberal political atmosphere. Party members began openly promoting a national identity for Taiwan separate from China. The DPP doctrine also supported reform of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] to change the name of Republic of China to \"Republic of Taiwan\", though the DPP never aimed to amend the Constitution through a referendum.\n\nOnce the DPP had representation in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (LY, or Parliament), the party used the legislature as a forum to challenge the government. However, it did not emerge as a formidable force until 1991, when the elderly LY members elected from [[mainland China]] provinces in 1948 retired. As the major opposition in the LY, the DPP worked with then-President [[Lee Teng-hui]], the then-leader of KMT, to push through a series of amendments to transfer into a [[semi-presidential system]] (for example, Republic of China's [[premier of the Republic of China|premier]] would no longer have to be confirmed by the LY). Among the electoral reforms, a [[party-list proportional representation|PR list]] was adopted and aboriginal seats in the LY created.\n\n===2000\u20132008: in minority government===\n[[File:Chen Shui-bian from VOA.jpg|thumb|right|Former President Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2000-2008)]]\n[[File:DPP-Taiwan-old.svg|thumb|right|Old DPP logo]]\nThe DPP won the presidency with the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|election]] of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in March 2000 with a plurality, due to [[Pan-Blue]] voters splitting their vote between the Kuomintang and independent candidate [[James Soong]], ending 91 years of KMT rule in the Republic of China. Chen softened the party's stance on independence to appeal to moderate voters, appease the United States, and placate China. He also promised not to [[Four Noes and One Without|change the ROC state symbols or declare formal independence]] as long as the [[China|People's Republic of China]] did not attack Taiwan.\n\nThe DPP became the largest party having reached a plurality in the Legislative Yuan for the first time in 2002 following the [[2001 Taiwan legislative election|2001 legislative election]]. However, a majority coalition between the KMT, [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] prevented it from taking control of the chamber.\n\nIn 2004, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow margin. He and Vice President [[Annette Lu]] had been involved in an assassination attempt only hours before the [[2004 Taiwan presidential election|election]]. The KMT candidate, [[Lien Chan]], demanded a recount the following morning. A judicial recount under the jurisdiction of a special panel of the High Court began on 10 May 2004 and ended on 18 May 2004. It was conducted by about 460 teams situated in 21 courthouses across the Taiwan area. Each team had seven members \u2013 one judge, two members each from the district court and the local government election authorities and two witnesses each representing the plaintiff ([[Pan-Blue Coalition]]) and the defendant ([[Pan-Green Coalition]]). Disputed votes were sent to High Court in Taipei for verification. After the recount, President Chen was confirmed the winner of the election by a smaller margin (25,563 as opposed to 29,518 originally). In the [[2004 Taiwan legislative election|later legislative election]], the Pan-Blue Coalition opposition retained control of the chamber.\n\nThe DPP suffered a significant election defeat in nationwide [[2005 Taiwanese local elections|local and county elections in December 2005]]. The pan-blue coalition captured 16 of 23 county and city government offices under the leadership of popular [[Taipei]] mayor and KMT Party Chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]].\n\nThe results led to a shake up of the party leadership. [[Su Tseng-chang]] resigned as DPP chairman soon after election results were announced. Su had pledged to step down if the DPP lost either Taipei County or failed to win 10 of the 23 mayor/magistrate positions. Vice President [[Annette Lu]] was appointed acting DPP leader. Presidential Office Secretary-General [[Yu Shyi-kun]] was elected in a [[2006 Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship election|three-way race]] against legislator [[Chai Trong-rong]] and [[Wong Chin-chu]] with 54.4% of the vote.\n\nPremier [[Frank Hsieh]], DPP election organizer and former mayor of [[Kaohsiung]] twice tendered a verbal resignation immediately following the election, but his resignation was not accepted by President Chen until 17 January 2006 after the DPP chairmanship election had concluded. The former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang was appointed to replace Hsieh as premier. Hsieh and his cabinet resigned en masse on January 24 to make way for Su and his new cabinet. President Chen had offered the position of Presidential Office Secretary-General (vacated by Su) to the departing premier, but Hsieh declined and left office criticizing President Chen for his tough line on dealing with China.\n\n====Separate identity====\nOn 30 September 2007, the DPP approved a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"normal nation\". It struck an accommodating tone by advocating general use of \"[[Taiwan]]\" as the country's name without calling for abandonment of the name Republic of China.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm AP, Republic of China Party Asserts Separate Identity]</ref>\n\n[[File:\u8521\u82f1\u6587\u5b98\u65b9\u5143\u9996\u8096\u50cf\u7167.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Tsai Ing-wen]], the second DPP [[President of the Republic of China|President]] (2016-present) and the leader of the DPP since 2008, she is the first female leader of the DPP.]]\n===2008\u20132016: back to opposition===\nIn the national elections held in early months of 2008, the DPP won less than 25% of the seats (38.2% vote share) in the new Legislative Yuan while its presidential candidate, former [[Kaohsiung]] mayor [[Frank Hsieh]], lost to KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] by a wide margin (41.55% vs. 58.45%). In May, the DPP elected [[Tsai Ing-wen]] as the new leader, Tsai became the first female leader of the DPP and the first female leader to lead a major party in Taiwan.\n\nThe first months since backed to the opposition were dominated by press coverage of the travails of [[Chen Shui-bian]] and his wife [[Wu Shu-jen]]. On 15 August 2008, Chen resigned from the DPP and apologized: \"Today I have to say sorry to all of the DPP members and supporters. I let everyone down, caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations. My acts have caused irreparable damage to the party. I love the DPP deeply and am proud of being a DPP member. To express my deepest regrets to all DPP members and supporters, I announce my withdrawal from the DPP immediately. My wife Wu Shu-jen is also withdrawing from the party.\" DPP Chairperson followed with a public statement on behalf of the party: \"In regard to Chen and his wife's decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the party's anti-corruption committee, we respect his decision and accept it.\"<ref>[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/17/former-taiwan-president-resigns-from-party-over-corruption-charges pacificmagazine.net, Former Republic of China President Resigns From Party Over Corruption Charges]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe DPP vowed to reflect on public misgivings towards the party.

The DPP marked the anniversary with massive rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Furthermore, its platform includes a legal and political order based on human rights and democracy; balanced economic and financial administration; fair and open social welfare; educational and cultural reform; and, independent defence and peaceful foreign policy with closer ties to United States and Japan. For these reasons, it used to be considered a party of the [[center-left]] economically though its base consisted largely of the [[middle class]]. The party also has a [[social liberal]] stance that includes support for [[gender equality]] and [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|LGBT rights]] (the party have supported [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]] under Tsai's leadership), and also have a strong [[social conservative]] base, including support from the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]. Since the democratisation of Taiwan in the 1990s, the DPP has had its strongest performance in the [[Hokkien]]-speaking counties and cities of Taiwan, compared with the predominantly [[Hakka]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking counties, that tend to support the [[Kuomintang]].\n\nThe primary political axis in Taiwan involves the issue of [[Taiwan independence]] versus eventual [[Cross-Strait Unification|unification with China]]. Although the differences tend to be portrayed in polarized terms, both major coalitions have developed modified, nuanced and often complex positions. Though opposed in the philosophical origins, the practical differences between such positions can sometimes be subtle.\n\nThe current official position of the party is that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country whose territory consists of Taiwan and its surrounding smaller islands and whose sovereignty derives only from the ROC citizens living in Taiwan (similar philosophy of [[self-determination]]), based on the \"[[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]]\" in 1999. It considers Taiwan as an independent nation under the name of Republic of China, making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. The DPP rejects the so-called \"[[One China principle]]\" defined in 1992 as the basis for official diplomatic relations with the PRC and advocates a Taiwanese national identity which is separate from mainland China. The DPP argues that its efforts to promote a Taiwanese national identity are merely an effort to normalize a Taiwanese identity repressed during years of authoritarian Kuomintang rule. The DPP also differs from the KMT on foreign and defense policies in that the DPP considers relations with the United States, Japan, and European states, among other democratic countries, crucial for Taiwan's security.\n\nIn contrast, the KMT or pan-blue coalition agrees that the Republic of China is an independent and sovereign country that is not part of the PRC, but argues that a one China principle (with different definitions across the strait) can be used as the basis for talks with China. The KMT also opposes the purposes of Taiwan independence and argues that efforts to establish a Taiwanese national identity separated from the Chinese national identity are unnecessary and needlessly provocative. Some KMT conservative officials have called efforts from DPP \"[[anti-China]]\" (opposing migrants from mainland China, whom DPP officials did not recognize as Taiwanese, but Chinese). At the other end of the political spectrum, the acceptance by the DPP of the symbols of the Republic of China is opposed by the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\nThe first years of the DPP as the ruling party drew accusations from the opposition that, as a self-styled Taiwanese [[nationalism|nationalist]] party, the DPP was itself inadequately sensitive to the ethnographic diversity of Taiwan's population. Where the KMT had been guilty of Chinese [[chauvinism]], the critics charged, the DPP might offer nothing more as a remedy than [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] chauvinism.\n\nChina has maintained a hostile position toward the DPP. It has made some efforts to moderate its tone since passing its [[Anti-Secession Law]] in 2005 to prevent a popular backlash from Taiwan's voters. In 2008, China stated it was willing to negotiate with any party in Taiwan that \"accepts the so-called [[1992 consensus]]\" (the consensus agreed by the KMT and the Communist Party of China). The DPP denies the existence of the 1992 consensus between China and Taiwan and demands a greater democratic opening in China.\n\nThe deep-rooted hostility between [[Taiwanese aborigines]] and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the aboriginal communities effective KMT networks contribute to aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}</ref> Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the \"indigenization\" movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP's \"rectification\" by recognizing the Truku for political reasons, where the Atayal and Seediq slammed the Truku for their name rectification.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0t_CU9gmi8cC&pg=PA220&dq=truku&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P0QfVbq1MomWsAXRt4SADA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=truku&f=false ed.

Malone stated that he would clash with Chip on [[Lord of the Mics]], a battle rap show hosted by [[Boy Better Know]] member Jammer, for the right amount of money, and Chip has also stated that he would be willing as long as he would be clashing against both Malone and Tempah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grmdaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-grime-beef-so-far/ |title=Updated: All you need to know about the Grime beef so far &#124; GRM Daily - Grime, Rap music and Culture |publisher=GRM Daily |date=5 April 2015 |accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Feud with Yungen===\nThis feud started when Chip mentioned [[Yungen]] in \"96 Bars of Revenge\".
