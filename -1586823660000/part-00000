The U.S. Army undertook several military campaigns against the hostile Indians to try to control the trail.  Because of its association with frontier history and conflict with American Indians, various segments of the trail are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP).\n\n== Establishment ==\nIn 1863, [[John Bozeman]] and [[John Jacobes (frontiersman)|John Jacobs]] scouted for a direct route from [[Virginia City, Montana]] to central [[Wyoming]] to connect with the Oregon Trail, then the major passage to the West Coast.  Before this, most access to the southwestern Montana Territory was from [[St. Louis]] via the [[Missouri River]] to [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]]. Thence travelers went by the 'Benton Road,' around the [[Great Falls (Missouri River)|Great Falls]] and through the Chestnut, Hilger and Prickly Pear valleys (current site of [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] and [[Broadwater County, Montana]]).\n\nThe overland Bozeman Trail followed many north-south trails the American Indians had used since prehistoric times to travel through [[Powder River Country]]. This route was more direct and better watered than any previous trail into Montana. Bozeman's and Jacobs's most important contribution was to improve the trail so that it was wide enough for wagons. But there was a major drawback&nbsp;&mdash; the trail passed directly through territory occupied by the [[Shoshone]], [[Arapaho]], and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] nations.\n\nDecades before the Bozeman Trail cut through the plains of present Wyoming, the expanse \"... was made busy by Crows and white trappers and traders ...\".<ref>Utley, Robert M.: The Bozeman Trail before John Bozeman: A busy Land.

They had invaded the western Powder River area during the 1850s and after \"large scale battles\" won this buffalo rich Indian land from the original tribe around 1860.<ref>Medicine Crow, Joseph: From the Heart of the Crow Country.

Indians killed between 40 and 50 of them. The short cut was at the time \"most often called the road to Montana\" and not the Bozeman Trail.<ref>Moulton, Candy: Susan Badger Doyle's two-volume work on the Bozeman Trail blazes some new ground.

Shorter or longer stretches of the route were altered every year to avoid the worst stages. The journey took around eight weeks. Many of the travelers had prepared themselves for the arduous trip by reading John Lyle Campbell's popular guidebook. Drowning and fatal accidents with firearms occurred. Some travelers came down with critical diseases such as \"mountain fever\" ([[Colorado tick fever]]) and never made it to their destination. Game including elk, mountain sheep and bear was shot an occasion, also buffalo. \"The men are killing them in large numbers. I feel sorry to see such destruction. They leave tons of good meat every day to be devoured by wolfs at night\", lamented traveler Richard Owen in 1864. The travelers grouped in organized \"trains\" with chosen people holding posts such as captain, train marshal and orderly sergeant. One group, known as the [[Townsend Wagon Train Fight|Townsend Wagon Train]], led by Captain [[A. A. Townsend]] of Wisconsin, was made up of \"wagons ... 150, men ... 375, women ... 36, children ... 36, oxen ... 636\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Benjamin|date=July 1864|title=Diary of Benjamin Ryan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DoMf1Uq-tMC&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=benjamin+w.+ryan+diary+of+bozeman+trail+and+trip+to+montana&source=bl&ots=VHDOXFg3K4&sig=ACfU3U0J4xGMylYgA-o4kpeLV4hsBJsgPQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiysZy82a_gAhXJHjQIHX-1De8Q6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=benjamin%20w.%20ryan%20diary%20of%20bozeman%20trail%20and%20trip%20to%20montana&f=false|journal=Handwritten Journal|volume=NA|pages=NA|via=}}</ref>. Every fifth of those crossing the plains via Bozeman Trail was a woman or a child. Each wagon paid the train pilot, maybe six dollars in 1864. Being a route used by single emigrants and small families at first, the trail transformed towards a supply route with freight wagons carrying equipment and necessities of life to the new, western towns.<ref>Doyle, Susan Badger (Ed.): ''Journeys to the Land of Gold.

Indian raids on white settlers increased dramatically from 1864 to 1866, which prompted the U.S. government to order the Army to carry out military campaigns against the [[Shoshone]]. [[Patrick Edward Connor]] led several of the earliest campaigns, including the [[Bear River Massacre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemhi-shoshone.com/bear-river-massacre.html |title=In remembrance of the Bear River Massacre |work=lemhi-shoshone.com/ |accessdate=2013-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016144408/http://lemhi-shoshone.com/bear-river-massacre.html |archive-date=2013-10-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  and the [[Powder River Expedition]] of 1865.

The trail itself diverged from the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California trail]] to the north through the [[Powder River Basin|Powder River]]. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] authorized construction of three forts in 1866 to guard travelers on the trail. Soldiers were harassed by [[Sioux Indians]], at that time led by [[Red Cloud]] (the United States named the war [[Red Cloud's War]] after the Sioux leader). Colonel [[Henry B. Carrington]] was stationed at a halfway point between [[Fort Laramie]] and the Bozeman trail, but his well-fortified position was not attacked directly. However, when Captain [[William J. Fetterman]], acting against orders, led soldiers in retaliation for attacks against [[Fort Kearny]] all eighty of Fetterman's men were killed. In the aftermath of the [[Fetterman Fight]] the United States agreed, a part of the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]], to abandon its forts along the Bozeman Trail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogland|first=Alison K.|title=Army Architecture in the West: Forts Laramie, Bridger and D.A.

Around 1200 wagons brought some 2000 people to the city of Bozeman following the trail that year.<ref>Doyle, Susan Badger (Ed.): Journeys to the Land of Gold. Emigrant Diaries from the Bozeman Trail, 1863-1866. Helena, 2000, Vol. 2, p. 423.</ref> The Army called a council at [[Fort Laramie]], which [[Lakota people|Lakota]] leader [[Red Cloud]] attended. The Army wanted to negotiate a right-of-way with the Lakota for settlers' use of the trail. As negotiations continued, [[Red Cloud]] became outraged when he discovered that a regiment of U.S. infantry was already using the route without receiving permission from the Lakota nation. Thus [[Red Cloud's War]] began.\n\n[[File:Bozeman Trail, the forts and the Indian territories.jpg|thumb|Bozeman Trail, Fort C.F.

The U.S. Army undertook several military campaigns against the hostile Indians to try to control the trail.  Because of its association with frontier history and conflict with American Indians, various segments of the trail are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP).\n\n== Establishment ==\nIn 1863, [[John Bozeman]] and [[John Jacobes (frontiersman)|John Jacobs]] scouted for a direct route from [[Virginia City, Montana]] to central [[Wyoming]] to connect with the Oregon Trail, then the major passage to the West Coast.  Before this, most access to the southwestern Montana Territory was from [[St. Louis]] via the [[Missouri River]] to [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]]. Thence travelers went by the 'Benton Road,' around the [[Great Falls (Missouri River)|Great Falls]] and through the Chestnut, Hilger and Prickly Pear valleys (current site of [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] and [[Broadwater County, Montana]]).\n\nThe overland Bozeman Trail followed many north-south trails the American Indians had used since prehistoric times to travel through [[Powder River Country]]. This route was more direct and better watered than any previous trail into Montana. Bozeman's and Jacobs's most important contribution was to improve the trail so that it was wide enough for wagons. But there was a major drawback&nbsp;&mdash; the trail passed directly through territory occupied by the [[Shoshone]], [[Arapaho]], and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] nations.\n\nDecades before the Bozeman Trail cut through the plains of present Wyoming, the expanse \"... was made busy by Crows and white trappers and traders ...\".<ref>Utley, Robert M.: The Bozeman Trail before John Bozeman: A busy Land.

Indians killed between 40 and 50 of them. The short cut was at the time \"most often called the road to Montana\" and not the Bozeman Trail.<ref>Moulton, Candy: Susan Badger Doyle's two-volume work on the Bozeman Trail blazes some new ground.

Shorter or longer stretches of the route were altered every year to avoid the worst stages. The journey took around eight weeks. Many of the travelers had prepared themselves for the arduous trip by reading John Lyle Campbell's popular guidebook. Drowning and fatal accidents with firearms occurred. Some travelers came down with critical diseases such as \"mountain fever\" ([[Colorado tick fever]]) and never made it to their destination. Game including elk, mountain sheep and bear was shot an occasion, also buffalo. \"The men are killing them in large numbers. I feel sorry to see such destruction. They leave tons of good meat every day to be devoured by wolfs at night\", lamented traveler Richard Owen in 1864. The travelers grouped in organized \"trains\" with chosen people holding posts such as captain, train marshal and orderly sergeant. One group, known as the Townsend Wagon Train, led by Captain [[A. A. Townsend]] of Wisconsin, was made up of \"wagons ... 150, men ... 375, women ... 36, children ... 36, oxen ... 636\". Every fifth of those crossing the plains via Bozeman Trail was a woman or a child. Each wagon paid the train pilot, maybe six dollars in 1864. Being a route used by single emigrants and small families at first, the trail transformed towards a supply route with freight wagons carrying equipment and necessities of life to the new, western towns.<ref>Doyle, Susan Badger (Ed.): ''Journeys to the Land of Gold.

Indian raids on white settlers increased dramatically from 1864 to 1866, which prompted the U.S. government to order the Army to carry out military campaigns against the [[Shoshone]]. [[Patrick Edward Connor]] led several of the earliest campaigns, including the [[Bear River Massacre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemhi-shoshone.com/bear-river-massacre.html |title=In remembrance of the Bear River Massacre |work=lemhi-shoshone.com/ |accessdate=2013-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016144408/http://lemhi-shoshone.com/bear-river-massacre.html |archive-date=2013-10-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  and the [[Powder River Expedition]] of 1865.

The trail itself diverged from the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California trail]] to the north through the [[Powder River Basin|Powder River]]. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] authorized construction of three forts in 1866 to guard travelers on the trail. Soldiers were harassed by [[Sioux Indians]], at that time led by [[Red Cloud]] (the United States named the war [[Red Cloud's War]] after the Sioux leader). Colonel [[Henry B. Carrington]] was stationed at a halfway point between [[Fort Laramie]] and the Bozeman trail, but his well-fortified position was not attacked directly. However, when Captain [[William J. Fetterman]], acting against orders, led soldiers in retaliation for attacks against [[Fort Kearny]] all eighty of Fetterman's men were killed. In the aftermath of the [[Fetterman Fight]] the United States agreed, a part of the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]], to abandon its forts along the Bozeman Trail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogland|first=Alison K.|title=Army Architecture in the West: Forts Laramie, Bridger and D.A.

Around 1200 wagons brought some 2000 people to the city of Bozeman following the trail that year.<ref>Doyle, Susan Badger (Ed.): Journeys to the Land of Gold. Emigrant Diaries from the Bozeman Trail, 1863-1866. Helena, 2000, Vol. 2, p. 423.</ref> The Army called a council at [[Fort Laramie]], which [[Lakota people|Lakota]] leader [[Red Cloud]] attended. The Army wanted to negotiate a right-of-way with the Lakota for settlers' use of the trail. As negotiations continued, [[Red Cloud]] became outraged when he discovered that a regiment of U.S. infantry was already using the route without receiving permission from the Lakota nation. Thus [[Red Cloud's War]] began.\n\n[[File:Bozeman Trail, the forts and the Indian territories.jpg|thumb|Bozeman Trail, Fort C.F.

They travelled to the grove of [[Dionysus]] and planned to celebrate the rites of Bacchus at dawn. Heracles slept alone in a bed covered with the clothes of Omphale. The Greek god [[Pan_(god)|Pan]] hoped to have his way with Omphale and crept naked into the bed of Heracles who threw Pan to the floor and laughed.<ref>''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' 2.303-62.</ref><ref>[[Confessio Amantis]]5.6807-6960</ref>\n\n===Sons of Heracles in Lydia===\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] (4.31.8) and [[Ovid]] in his ''Heroides'' (9.54) mention a son named [[Lamos (Cilicia)|Lamos]]. But ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.7.8) gives the name of the son of Heracles and Omphale as [[Agelaus]].\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2.21.3) gives yet another name, mentioning Tyrsenus, son of Heracles by \"the Lydian woman\", by whom Pausanias presumably means Omphale. This Tyrsenus supposedly first invented the trumpet, and Tyrsenus' son Hegeleus taught the [[Dorians]] with [[Temenus]] how to play the trumpet and first gave to [[Athena]] the surname ''Trumpet''.\n\n[[Image:Dausch Omphale im Fell des L\u00f6wen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|''Omphale'', by [[Constantin Dausch]]]]\nThe name ''Tyrsenus'' appears elsewhere as a variant of [[Tyrrhenus]], whom many accounts bring from Lydia to settle the Tyrsenoi/ Tyrrhenians/ [[Etruscans]] in [[Italy]]. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (1.28.1) cites a tradition that the supposed founder of the Etruscan settlements was Tyrrhenus, the son of Heracles by Omphale the Lydian, who drove the [[Pelasgians]] out of Italy from the cities north of the [[Tiber]] river. Dionysius gives this as an alternate to other versions of Tyrrhenus' ancestry.\n\n[[Herodotus]] (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale, writing, \"The Heraclids, descended from Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanus....\" Omphale as slave-girl seems odd. However, Diodorus Siculus relates that when Heracles was still Omphale's slave, before Omphale (daughter of Iardanus) set Heracles free and married him, Heracles fathered a son, Cleodaeus, on a slave-woman. This fits, though in Herodotus the son of Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanus is named Alcaeus.\n\nBut according to the historian [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus of Lydia]] (fifth century B.C.) as cited by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], the Heraclid dynasty of Lydia traced their descent to a son of Heracles and Omphale named Tylon, and were called Tylonidai.

In the genealogy given by Herodotus, someone may have grafted the tradition of a Lydian son of Heracles at the top end of it, so that Ninus and Belus in the list now become descendants of Heracles, who just happen to bear the same names as the more famous Ninus and Belus.\n\nThat, at least, is the interpretation of later chronologists who also ignored Herodotus' statement that Agron was the first to be a king, and included Alcaeus, Belus, and Ninus in their [[List of kings of Lydia]].\n\nAs to how Agron gained the kingdom from the older dynasty descended from [[Lydus]] son of [[Atys of Lydia|Atys]], Herodotus only says that the Heraclids, \"having been entrusted by these princes with the management of affairs, obtained the kingdom by an oracle.\"\n\n[[Strabo]] (5.2.2) makes Atys father of Lydus, and [[Tyrrhenus]] to be one of the descendants of Heracles and Omphale.

They travelled to the grove of [[Dionysus]] and planned to celebrate the rites of Bacchus at dawn. Heracles slept alone in a bed covered with the clothes of Omphale. The Greek god [[Pan_(god)|Pan]] hoped to have his way with Omphale and crept naked into the bed of Heracles who threw Pan to the floor and laughed.<ref>''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' 2.303-62.</ref><ref>[[Confessio Amantis]]5.6807-6960</ref>\n\n===Sons of Heracles in Lydia===\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] (4.31.8) and [[Ovid]] in his ''Heroides'' (9.54) mention a son named [[Lamos (Cilicia)|Lamos]]. But ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.7.8) gives the name of the son of Heracles and Omphale as [[Agelaus]].\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2.21.3) gives yet another name, mentioning Tyrsenus, son of Heracles by \"the Lydian woman\", by whom Pausanias presumably means Omphale. This Tyrsenus supposedly first invented the trumpet, and Tyrsenus' son Hegeleus taught the [[Dorians]] with [[Temenus]] how to play the trumpet and first gave to [[Athena]] the surname ''Trumpet''.\n\n[[Image:Dausch Omphale im Fell des L\u00f6wen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|''Omphale'', by [[Constantin Dausch]]]]\nThe name ''Tyrsenus'' appears elsewhere as a variant of [[Tyrrhenus]], whom many accounts bring from Lydia to settle the Tyrsenoi/ Tyrrhenians/ [[Etruscans]] in [[Italy]]. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (1.28.1) cites a tradition that the supposed founder of the Etruscan settlements was Tyrrhenus, the son of Heracles by Omphale the Lydian, who drove the [[Pelasgians]] out of Italy from the cities north of the [[Tiber]] river. Dionysius gives this as an alternate to other versions of Tyrrhenus' ancestry.\n\n[[Herodotus]] (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale, writing, \"The Heraclids, descended from Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanus....\" Omphale as slave-girl seems odd. However, Diodorus Siculus relates that when Heracles was still Omphale's slave, before Omphale (daughter of Iardanus) set Heracles free and married him, Heracles fathered a son, Cleodaeus, on a slave-woman. This fits, though in Herodotus the son of Heracles and the slave-girl of Iardanus is named Alcaeus.\n\nBut according to the historian [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus of Lydia]] (fifth century B.C.) as cited by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], the Heraclid dynasty of Lydia traced their descent to a son of Heracles and Omphale named Tylon, and were called Tylonidai. We know from coins that this Tylon was a native [[Anatolia]]n god equated with the Greek Heracles.\n\nHerodotus asserts that the first of the Heraclids to reign in [[Sardis]] was Agron, the son of Ninus, son of Belus, son of Alcaeus, son of Heracles.<ref>{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S\u00e9lincourt | 1954 | p=43}}</ref> Later writers know a [[Ninus]] who is the primordial king of [[Assyria]], and they often call this Ninus son of Belus.
