Their fruits are quite variable, although most are easily recognised as kiwifruit because of their appearance and shape. The skin of the fruit varies in size, hairiness and colour. The flesh varies in colour, juiciness, texture and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable, while others taste considerably better than the majority of commercial cultivars.<ref name=Morton /><ref name=\"PONC1999\" />\n\nThe most commonly sold kiwifruit is derived from ''[[Actinidia deliciosa|A.&nbsp;deliciosa]]'' (fuzzy kiwifruit). Other species that are commonly eaten include ''[[Actinidia chinensis|A.&nbsp;chinensis]]'' (golden kiwifruit), ''[[Actinidia coriacea|A.&nbsp;coriacea]]'' (Chinese egg gooseberry), ''[[Actinidia arguta|A.&nbsp;arguta]]'' (hardy kiwifruit), ''[[Actinidia kolomikta|A.&nbsp;kolomikta]]'' (Arctic kiwifruit), ''[[Actinidia melanandra|A.&nbsp;melanandra]]'' (purple kiwifruit), ''[[Actinidia polygama|A.&nbsp;polygama]]'' (silver vine) and ''[[Actinidia purpurea|A.&nbsp;purpurea]]'' (hearty red kiwifruit).<ref name=\"PONC1999\" />\n\n===''Actinidia deliciosa''===\n[[File:Hardy-Kiwi-Comparison-3.jpg|thumb|The larger ''A. deliciosa'' (fuzzy kiwifruit) at the rear compared to the smaller kiwi berry]]\nMost kiwifruit sold belongs to a few cultivars of ''A.&nbsp;deliciosa'' (fuzzy kiwifruit): 'Hayward', 'Blake' and 'Saanichton 12'.<ref name=\"PWNEP\" /> They have a fuzzy, dull brown skin and bright green flesh.

It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavour. 'Saanichton 12', from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than 'Hayward' and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit can be tough. 'Blake' can self-pollinate, but it has a smaller, more oval fruit and the flavour is considered inferior.<ref name=\"PWNEP\" /><ref name=\"PONC1999\" />\n\n===Kiwi berries===\nKiwi berries are edible fruits the size of a large grape, similar to fuzzy kiwifruit in taste and internal appearance, but the thin, smooth green skin and lack of fuzz makes eating the entire fruit more pleasant. They are primarily produced by three species: ''[[Actinidia arguta]]'' (hardy kiwi), ''[[Actinidia kolomikta|A. kolomikta]]'' (Arctic kiwifruit) and ''[[Actinidia polygama|A. polygama]]'' (silver vine). They are fast-growing, climbing vines, durable over their [[growing season]].

Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, [[seedling]]s take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming.<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web |url=http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/education/fruitnutproduction/Kiwi/Kiwi_Propagation/ |title=Kiwifruit Propagation |publisher=University of California-Davis, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new [[cultivar]]s, are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]].<ref name=\"ucd\" /> This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.<ref name=\"ucd\" />\n\n===Pollination===\n[[File:Kiwifruit Female Flowers.JPG|thumb|Kiwifruit flowering]]\nKiwifruit plants generally are [[dioecious]], meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to [[pollinate]] the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate.<ref name=Morton /> Some varieties can self pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit.<ref name=Morton /> Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\n\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips in order to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/72-kiwifruit-pollination-problems|title=Kiwifruit pollination problems|website=Science Learning Hub}}</ref>\n\nKiwifruit growers rely on [[honey bees]], the principal \u2018for-hire\u2019 pollinator. But commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, in part because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\n\nAnd for kiwifruit, honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators because they practice \u201cfloral fidelity\u201d. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony. It is in the colonies where bees laden with different pollen literally cross paths.<ref>https://honeybeesuite.com/how-bees-transfer-pollen-between-flowers/ Honey Bee Suite</ref>\n\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\"/> Most common, though, is [[saturation pollination]], where the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Maturation and harvest===\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\n\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Storage===\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.<ref name=Morton />\n\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.<ref name=ukfoodguide>{{cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the [[ethylene]] gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.<ref name=ukfoodguide /> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.<ref name=ukfoodguide />\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n''[[Pseudomonas syringae]] actinidiae'' (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s.

Where fuzzy kiwifruit (''A. deliciosa'') is not hardy, other species can be grown as substitutes.\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Kiwifruit-Actinidia deliciosa-plantation.jpg|thumb|Kiwifruit growing on supported vine]]\nOften in commercial farming, different breeds are used for [[rootstock]], fruit bearing plants and [[pollinators]].<ref name=Morton /> Therefore, the seeds produced are [[crossbreed]]s of their parents. Even if the same breeds are used for pollinators and fruit bearing plants, there is no guarantee that the fruit will have the same quality as the parent. Additionally, [[seedling]]s take seven years before they flower, so determining whether the kiwi is fruit bearing or a pollinator is time-consuming.<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web |url=http://fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu/education/fruitnutproduction/Kiwi/Kiwi_Propagation/ |title=Kiwifruit Propagation |publisher=University of California-Davis, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> Therefore, most kiwifruits, with the exception of rootstock and new [[cultivar]]s, are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]].<ref name=\"ucd\" /> This is done by grafting the fruit producing plant onto rootstock grown from seedlings or, if the plant is desired to be a true cultivar, rootstock grown from cuttings of a mature plant.<ref name=\"ucd\" />\n\n===Pollination===\n[[File:Kiwifruit Female Flowers.JPG|thumb|Kiwifruit flowering]]\nKiwifruit plants generally are [[dioecious]], meaning a plant is either male or female. The male plants have flowers that produce pollen, the females receive the pollen to fertilise their ovules and grow fruit; most kiwifruit requires a male plant to [[pollinate]] the female plant. For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is considered adequate.<ref name=Morton /> Some varieties can self pollinate, but even they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit.<ref name=Morton /> Cross-species pollination is often (but not always) successful as long as bloom times are synchronised.\n\nIn nature, the species are pollinated by birds and native bumblebees, which visit the flowers for pollen, not nectar. The female flowers produce fake anthers with what appears to be pollen on the tips in order to attract the pollinators, although these fake anthers lack the DNA and food value of the male anthers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/72-kiwifruit-pollination-problems|title=Kiwifruit pollination problems|website=Science Learning Hub}}</ref>\n\nKiwifruit growers rely on [[honey bees]], the principal \u2018for-hire\u2019 pollinator. But commercially grown kiwifruit is notoriously difficult to pollinate. The flowers are not very attractive to honey bees, in part because the flowers do not produce nectar and bees quickly learn to prefer flowers with nectar.\n\nAnd for kiwifruit, honey bees are inefficient cross-pollinators because they practice \u201cfloral fidelity\u201d. Each honey bee visits only a single type of flower in any foray and maybe only a few branches of a single plant. The pollen needed from a different plant (such as a male for a female kiwifruit) might never reach it were it not for the cross-pollination that principally occurs in the crowded colony. It is in the colonies where bees laden with different pollen literally cross paths.<ref>https://honeybeesuite.com/how-bees-transfer-pollen-between-flowers/ Honey Bee Suite</ref>\n\nTo deal with these pollination challenges, some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers.<ref name=\"Kiwifruit pollination problems\"/> Most common, though, is [[saturation pollination]], where the honey bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Maturation and harvest===\nKiwifruit is picked by hand and commercially grown on sturdy support structures, as it can produce several tonnes per hectare, more than the rather weak vines can support. These are generally equipped with a watering system for irrigation and frost protection in the spring.\n\nKiwifruit vines require vigorous pruning, similar to that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on a vine one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.<ref name=Morton />\n\n===Storage===\nFruits harvested when firm will ripen when stored properly for long periods. This allows fruit to be sent to market up to 8 weeks after harvest.<ref name=Morton />\n\nFirm kiwifruit ripen after a few days to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster ripening occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana.<ref name=ukfoodguide>{{cite web|title=Kiwi fruit|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/kiwifruit.htm|publisher=The UK Food Guide|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the [[ethylene]] gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator.<ref name=ukfoodguide /> If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.<ref name=ukfoodguide />\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n''[[Pseudomonas syringae]] actinidiae'' (PSA) was first identified in Japan in the 1980s.

A varying current in any one coil of the transformer produces a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core, which induces a varying [[electromotive force]] across any other coils wound around the same core.\nElectrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. [[Faraday's law of induction]], discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\n\nTransformers are most commonly used for increasing low [[Alternating current|AC]] voltages at high current (a step-up transformer) or decreasing high AC voltages at low current (a step-down transformer) in electric power applications, and for coupling the stages of signal processing circuits. Transformers can also be used for isolation, where the voltage in equals the voltage out, with separate coils not electrically bonded to one another.\n\nSince the invention of the first [[constant-potential transformer]] in 1885, transformers have become essential for the [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of alternating current electric power.<ref name=\"Bedell (1942)\">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456|year=1942}}</ref> A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications.

This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (EMF, voltage) in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction and the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]].\n\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a [[voltage source]] connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\n\nAccording to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of windings.

In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\">{{harvnb|McLaren|1984|pp=68\u201374}}</ref> Such flux is termed ''leakage flux'', and results in [[leakage inductance]] in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with the mutually coupled transformer windings.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior [[voltage regulation]], causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\"/> Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\n\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] current it will supply.<ref name=\"calvert2001\">{{cite web| last = Calvert| first = James| title = Inside Transformers| publisher = University of Denver| year = 2001| url = http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| accessdate = May 19, 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070509111407/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| archivedate = May 9, 2007}}</ref> Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit [[negative resistance]], such as [[electric arc]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-]] and [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] vapor lamps and [[neon sign]]s or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as [[arc welding|electric arc welders]].<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>{{rp|485}}\n\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terman|first=Frederick E.|title=Electronic and Radio Engineering| edition=4th |year=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=15}}</ref> A [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\n\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel.

This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.\n\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: [[open-circuit test]], [[short-circuit test]], winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\n\n===Transformer EMF equation===\n{{anchor|Transformer universal EMF equation}}\nIf the flux in the core is purely [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its '''[[root mean square|rms]] voltage''' ''E''<sub>rms</sub> of the winding, and the supply frequency ''f'', number of turns ''N'', core cross-sectional area ''a'' in m<sup>2</sup> and peak magnetic flux density ''B''<sub>peak</sub> in Wb/m<sup>2</sup> or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>\n\n<math> E_\\text{rms} = {\\frac {2 \\pi f N a B_\\text{peak}} {\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx 4.44 f N a B_\\text{peak}</math>\n\n===Polarity===\nA [[dot convention]] is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a [[phasor]] diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\n\n===Effect of frequency===\nThe EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor [[skin effect]] also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&nbsp;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.<ref>{{cite web | title = 400 Hz Electrical Systems | work = Aerospaceweb.org | url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml | accessdate = May 21, 2007}}</ref> Conversely, frequencies used for some [[railway electrification system]]s were much lower (e.g. 16.7&nbsp;Hz and 25&nbsp;Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50\u201360&nbsp;Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early [[traction motor|electric traction motors]]. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\n\n[[File:Power Transformer Over-Excitation.gif|thumb|Power transformer over-excitation condition caused by decreased frequency; flux (green), iron core's magnetic characteristics (red) and magnetizing current (blue).]]\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require [[protective relay]]s to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\n\nOne example is in traction transformers used for [[electric multiple unit]] and [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50&nbsp;Hz down to 16.7&nbsp;Hz and rated up to 25&nbsp;kV).\n\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\n\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\n\n===Energy losses===\nTransformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity.

The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing [[energy efficient transformer]]s for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]], or even [[Electrical steel#Amorphous steel|amorphous steel]] for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost.

These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-9\"/> Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\n\n====Toroidal cores====\n[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]\nToroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-1\">{{harvnb|McLyman|2004|p=3-1}}</ref> A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> {{rp|485}} The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\n\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10&nbsp;kVA, and practically none above 25&nbsp;kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticsmagazine.com/main/articles/toroidal-line-power-transformers-power-ratings-tripled/|title=Toroidal Line Power Transformers.

An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.<ref>{{cite web| first = Reuben| last = Lee| title = Air-Core Transformers| work = Electronic Transformers and Circuits| url = http://www.vias.org/eltransformers/lee_electronic_transformers_07b_22.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> Air cores are also used for [[Resonant inductive coupling|resonant transformers]] such as Tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\n\n===Windings===\n[[Image:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.]]\n[[Image:transformer min stray field geometry.svg|thumb|left|Cut view through transformer windings.\nLegend: <br>\n'''White''': Air, liquid or other insulating medium <br>\n'''Green spiral''': [[Electrical steel|Grain oriented silicon steel]]<br>\n'''Black''': Primary winding <br>\n'''Red''': Secondary winding\n]]\nThe electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from [[enameled wire|enamelled magnet wire]].

The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.<ref name=\"CEGB1982\"/>\n\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\n\nPower-frequency transformers may have ''taps'' at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A [[Center tap|center-tapped transformer]] is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[Push-pull converter|push-pull circuit]].

[[Nicholas Callan]] of [[Maynooth College]], Ireland in 1836.<ref name=\"Guarnieri2013-56\"/> He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\n\n===First alternating current transformers===\nBy the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].\n\nIn 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.<ref name=maglab>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|title=Stanley Transformer|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]]|accessdate=Jan 9, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|archivedate=January 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1878, the [[Ganz Works|Ganz factory]], Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.

Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=Uppenborn1889/>\nEfficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[war of the currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.<ref name=\"Coltman1988\">{{harvnb|Coltman|Jan 1988|pp=86\u201395}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Trafo1885.jpg|thumb|Shell form transformer.

A varying current in any one coil of the transformer produces a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core, which induces a varying [[electromotive force]] across any other coils wound around the same core.\nElectrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. [[Faraday's law of induction]], discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\n\nTransformers are most commonly used for increasing low [[Alternating current|AC]] voltages at high current (a step-up transformer) or decreasing high AC voltages at low current (a step-down transformer) in electric power applications, and for coupling the stages of signal processing circuits. Transformers can also be used for isolation, where the voltage in equals the voltage out, with separate coils not electrically bonded to one another.\n\nSince the invention of the first [[constant-potential transformer]] in 1885, transformers have become essential for the [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of alternating current electric power.<ref name=\"Bedell (1942)\">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456|year=1942}}</ref> A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications.

This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (EMF, voltage) in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction and the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]].\n\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a [[voltage source]] connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\n\nAccording to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of windings. The transformer winding voltage ratio is directly proportional to the winding turns ratio.<ref>Paul A.

In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\">{{harvnb|McLaren|1984|pp=68\u201374}}</ref> Such flux is termed ''leakage flux'', and results in [[leakage inductance]] in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with the mutually coupled transformer windings.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior [[voltage regulation]], causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.<ref name=\"McLaren1984-68\"/> Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\n\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] current it will supply.<ref name=\"calvert2001\">{{cite web| last = Calvert| first = James| title = Inside Transformers| publisher = University of Denver| year = 2001| url = http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| accessdate = May 19, 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070509111407/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/transfor.htm| archivedate = May 9, 2007}}</ref> Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit [[negative resistance]], such as [[electric arc]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-]] and [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] vapor lamps and [[neon sign]]s or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as [[arc welding|electric arc welders]].<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>{{rp|485}}\n\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terman|first=Frederick E.|title=Electronic and Radio Engineering| edition=4th |year=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=15}}</ref> A [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\n\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel.

This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.\n\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: [[open-circuit test]], [[short-circuit test]], winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\n\n===Transformer EMF equation===\n{{anchor|Transformer universal EMF equation}}\nIf the flux in the core is purely [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its '''[[root mean square|rms]] voltage''' ''E''<sub>rms</sub> of the winding, and the supply frequency ''f'', number of turns ''N'', core cross-sectional area ''a'' in m<sup>2</sup> and peak magnetic flux density ''B''<sub>peak</sub> in Wb/m<sup>2</sup> or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:<ref name=\"Say1983\"/>\n\n<math> E_\\text{rms} = {\\frac {2 \\pi f N a B_\\text{peak}} {\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx 4.44 f N a B_\\text{peak}</math>\n\n===Polarity===\nA [[dot convention]] is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's \u2018dot\u2019 end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a [[phasor]] diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\n\n===Effect of frequency===\nThe EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor [[skin effect]] also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&nbsp;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.<ref>{{cite web | title = 400 Hz Electrical Systems | work = Aerospaceweb.org | url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml | accessdate = May 21, 2007}}</ref> Conversely, frequencies used for some [[railway electrification system]]s were much lower (e.g. 16.7&nbsp;Hz and 25&nbsp;Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50\u201360&nbsp;Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early [[traction motor|electric traction motors]]. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\n\n[[File:Power Transformer Over-Excitation.gif|thumb|Power transformer over-excitation condition caused by decreased frequency; flux (green), iron core's magnetic characteristics (red) and magnetizing current (blue).]]\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require [[protective relay]]s to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\n\nOne example is in traction transformers used for [[electric multiple unit]] and [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50&nbsp;Hz down to 16.7&nbsp;Hz and rated up to 25&nbsp;kV).\n\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\n\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\n\n===Energy losses===\nTransformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity.

The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing [[energy efficient transformer]]s for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]], or even [[Electrical steel#Amorphous steel|amorphous steel]] for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost.

These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-9\"/> Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient (inductors)|coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\n\n====Toroidal cores====\n[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]\nToroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].<ref name=\"McLyman2004-3-1\">{{harvnb|McLyman|2004|p=3-1}}</ref> A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<ref name=\"Say1983\"/> {{rp|485}} The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\n\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10&nbsp;kVA, and practically none above 25&nbsp;kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticsmagazine.com/main/articles/toroidal-line-power-transformers-power-ratings-tripled/|title=Toroidal Line Power Transformers.

An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,<ref name=\"calvert2001\"/> but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.<ref>{{cite web| first = Reuben| last = Lee| title = Air-Core Transformers| work = Electronic Transformers and Circuits| url = http://www.vias.org/eltransformers/lee_electronic_transformers_07b_22.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> Air cores are also used for [[Resonant inductive coupling|resonant transformers]] such as Tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\n\n===Windings===\n[[Image:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.]]\n[[Image:transformer min stray field geometry.svg|thumb|left|Cut view through transformer windings.\nLegend: <br>\n'''White''': Air, liquid or other insulating medium <br>\n'''Green spiral''': [[Electrical steel|Grain oriented silicon steel]]<br>\n'''Black''': Primary winding <br>\n'''Red''': Secondary winding\n]]\nThe electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from [[enameled wire|enamelled magnet wire]].

The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.<ref name=\"CEGB1982\"/>\n\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\n\nPower-frequency transformers may have ''taps'' at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A [[Center tap|center-tapped transformer]] is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[Push-pull converter|push-pull circuit]].

[[Nicholas Callan]] of [[Maynooth College]], Ireland in 1836.<ref name=\"Guarnieri2013-56\"/> He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\n\n===First alternating current transformers===\nBy the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].\n\nIn 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.<ref name=maglab>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|title=Stanley Transformer|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]]|accessdate=Jan 9, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|archivedate=January 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1878, the [[Ganz Works|Ganz factory]], Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.

Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=Uppenborn1889/>\nEfficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[war of the currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.<ref name=\"Coltman1988\">{{harvnb|Coltman|Jan 1988|pp=86\u201395}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Trafo1885.jpg|thumb|Shell form transformer.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} ''Partimenti'', or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century. Because learning the Italian style of music was a priority for almost any eighteenth-century musician, many well-known non-Italian composers, including Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, also studied or taught partimenti.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence in Germany ===\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance === \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence in Germany ===\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance === \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

In 2003 the island voted in favour of [[secession]] from Guadeloupe in order to form a separate [[overseas collectivity]] (''collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer'', abbreviated to ''COM'') of France.

It is the only Caribbean island that was a [[Swedish colony of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Swedish colony]] for any significant length of time; before the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Guadeloupe came under Swedish rule for nearly a century. Symbolism from the [[Coat of arms of Sweden|Swedish national arms]], the [[Three Crowns]], still appears in the island's coat of arms.

During the rainy season the area turns green with vegetation and grass. The eastern part of the island is greener as it receives more rainfall. A 1994 survey has revealed several hundred indigenous species of plants including the naturalized varieties of flora; some growing in irrigated areas while the dry areas are dominated by the cacti variety. [[Coccoloba uvifera|Sea grapes]] and [[palm tree]]s are a common sight with [[mangrove]]s and [[shrub]]s surviving in the saline coastal swamps.

It is stated that it will take 15\u201350 years for this species to attain reproductive age. Though they live in the sea, the females come to the shore to lay eggs and are protected by private societies. Three species of turtles are particularly notable. These are: The [[leatherback sea turtle]]s which have leather skin instead of a shell and are the largest of the type found here, some times measuring a much as {{convert|3|m|abbr=off|0}} (average is about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}) and weighing about 450 ([[jellyfish]] is their favourite diet); the [[hawksbill turtles]], which have hawk-like beaks and found near reefs, generally about {{convert|90|cm|abbr=off}} in diameter and weigh about 60 and their diet consists of [[crabs]] and [[snails]]; and the [[green turtles]], [[herbivores]] which have rounded heads, generally about {{convert|90|cm|abbr=off}} in diameter and live amidst tall sea grasses.<ref name=\"Nash2008\"/><ref name=\"Sullivan, p.11-12\">Sullivan, pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\n====Avifauna====\n[[File:Male Frigate bird.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frigatebird]]]]\n\nAvifauna in the wild, both native and migrating include [[brown pelican]] along the shore line, [[magnificent frigatebird]]s with long wingspans of up to 1.8 metres (6'), [[green heron]]s, [[snowy egret]]s, [[belted kingfisher]]s; [[bananaquit]]s; [[broad-winged hawk]]s; two species of [[hummingbird]]s, the [[green-throated carib]] and [[Antillean crested hummingbird]]; and [[zenaida doves]].<ref name=\"Nash2008\"/><ref name=\"Sullivan, p.12-13\">Sullivan, pp. 12\u201313</ref>\n\n====Aquafauna====\n[[File:Ocypode quadrata (Cahuita).jpg|thumb|[[Ghost crab]]]]\n\nThe marine life found here consists of [[anemones]], [[Sea urchin|urchin]]s, [[sea cucumbers]], and [[eels]], which all live on the reefs along with [[turtle]]s, [[conch]] and many varieties of marine fishes.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.181\">Sullivan, p.181</ref> The marine aquafauna is rich in conch, which has pearly-pink shells.

The Reserve includes the bays of Grand Cul de Sac, Colombier, Marigot, Petit Cul de Sac, Petite Anse as well as waters around offshore rocks such as Les Gross Islets, Pain de Sucre, Tortue and Forchue. The Reserve is designed to protect the islands coral reefs, seagrass and endangered marine species including sea turtles. The Reserve has two levels of protection, the yellow zones of protection where certain non-extractive activities, like snorkeling and boating, are allowed and the red zones of high protection where most activities including SCUBA are restricted in order to protect or recover marine life. Anchoring is prohibited in the Reserve and mooring buoys are in place in some of the protected bays like Colombier.\n\n== Landmarks and architecture ==\nAs well as Gustavia, the capital of St. Barth\u00e9lemy, there are many notable places and monuments in the island which testify to the island's colonial history under the Spanish, Swedish, British and French, and now a French territory.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\">Sullivan, pp. 170\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Gustavia===\n[[File:Gustavia Harbor, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.jpg|thumb|Gustavia Harbour]]\n\nGustavia is in a U-shaped cove facing the harbour on the west.

Earlier to their occupation, the port was known as \"Car\u00e9nage\". The Swedes renamed it as Gustavia in honour of their king [[Gustav III]]. It was then their prime trading center. The port maintained a neutral stance since the Caribbean war was on in the 18th century. They used it as trading post of contraband and the city of [[Gustavia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Gustavia]] prospered but this prosperity was short lived.<ref name=Introduction/>\n\nThese buildings also underwent further destruction during the hurricanes and also by gutting in 1852. However, some monuments are still intact such as the residence of the then Swedish governor, now the town hall{{Verify source|date=January 2011}}. The oldest colonial structure in the town is stated to be the bell tower (now without a bell) built in 1799, as part of a church (destroyed in the past), in the southeast end of the town on Rue Du Presbytere. Now, a large clock is installed in place of the bell.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\nThe road that runs parallel to the harbour face of the sea called the Rue de la Republique and two other roads connect to the two arms of the U-shaped bay.

One of these forts, known as Fort Oscar (formerly Gustav Adolph), which overlooks the sea is located on the far side of La Pointe. However, the ruins have been replaced by a modern military building which now houses the local gendarmerie. The other fort known as Fort Karl now presents a very few ruins. The third fort built by the Swedes is the Fort Gustav, which is also seen in ruins strewn around the weather station and the Light House.

From St. Barth\u00e9lemy, the bank extends east-southeast, ending in a small tongue or spit. It is separated from the main bank by a narrow length of deep water. East of the island, the edge of the bank lies {{convert|22|km|abbr=off}} away.<ref name=\"Barnett1876\"/>\n\nGrande Saline Bay provides temporary anchorage for small vessels while Colombier Bay, to the northwest, has a 4 fathoms patch near mid-entrance. In the bight of St. Jean Bay there is a narrow cut through the reef.<ref name=\"Barnett1876\"/> The north and east sides of the island are fringed, to a short distance from the shore, by a visible coral reef. Reefs are mostly in shallow waters and are clearly visible. The coastal areas abound with beaches and many of these have offshore reefs, some of which are part of a marine reserve.<ref name=\"Nash2008\"/>\n\nThe marine reserve, founded in 1999, covers more than {{convert|1000|ha}} of protected and vulnerable habitats, bays and islands, and includes a zone that is restricted to scientific observations only.<ref name=\"SpeightHenderson2010\">{{cite book |last1=Speight |first1=Martin R. |last2=Henderson |first2=P.

They are categorized and divided into two groups, the leeward side (calm waters protected by the island itself) and windward side (some of which are protected by hills and reefs). The windward beaches are popular for windsurfing. The beach of St Jean is suitable for water sports and facilities have been created for that purpose. The long beach at Lorient has shade and is a quiet beach as compared to St. Jean.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.177-178\">Sullivan, pp. 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nGrand-cul-de-sac is a long beach with facilities for water sports. Anse de Flamands is a very wide sandy beach and Le petit Anse (The little beach), just to the north of Anse de Flamands is very safe and popular with the locals for their children. Anse Toiny beach is in a remote location and is considered suitable for experienced surfers as the water current is very strong.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.177-178\"/>\n\nOn the leeward side, the notable beaches are: Anse du Gouverneur, Anse du Colombier that is only accessible by foot or by boat, Anse de Grand Galet (Shell Beach) and Anse de Grande Saline which is popular with nudists. The area around the salt ponds near the Anse de Grande Saline beach is marshy and is a habitat for tropical birds. Ile islet, an offshoot of the leeward side, has a white sandy beach.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.177-178\"/>\n\nShell Beach, also called Anse de Grand Galet (in French, 'Anse' means \"cove\" and Galet means \"pebble\"), is a beach in the southwestern part of Gustavia. A large number of sea shells are scattered on this beach. This beach was subject to the strong waves of hurricane [[Hurricane Lenny|Lenny]] in 1999, which resulted in erosion of the sand. This necessitated supplementing the beach with new sand in 2000.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\nOn the north coast, on the far eastern side of the island, there are two lagoons called the Anse de Marigot{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} and Anse du Grand Cul-de-Sac.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\n[[File:Beach at the Anse de Grande Saline on St. Barthelemy, French West Indies - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Beach at the Anse de Grande Saline]]\n\n===Interior areas===\n[[Morne du Vitet]], {{convert|286|m|abbr=off}} in height, is the highest peak on the island.<ref name=Government/> Hills and valleys of varying topography cover the rest of the island.<ref name=\"Nash2008\"/> Notable mountains on the island include [[Morne Rouge (mountain)|Morne Rouge]], [[Morne Criquet (mountain)|Morne Criquet]], [[Morne de Grand Fond]], [[Morne de D\u00e9poudr\u00e9 (mountains)|Morne de D\u00e9poudr\u00e9]] and [[Morne Lurin]].

The Reserve includes the bays of Grand Cul de Sac, Colombier, Marigot, Petit Cul de Sac, Petite Anse as well as waters around offshore rocks such as Les Gross Islets, Pain de Sucre, Tortue and Forchue. The Reserve is designed to protect the islands coral reefs, seagrass and endangered marine species including sea turtles. The Reserve has two levels of protection, the yellow zones of protection where certain non-extractive activities, like snorkeling and boating, are allowed and the red zones of high protection where most activities including SCUBA are restricted in order to protect or recover marine life. Anchoring is prohibited in the Reserve and mooring buoys are in place in some of the protected bays like Colombier.\n\n== Landmarks and architecture ==\nAs well as Gustavia, the capital of St. Barth\u00e9lemy, there are many notable places and monuments in the island which testify to the island's colonial history under the Spanish, Swedish, British and French, and now a French territory.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\">Sullivan, pp. 170\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Gustavia===\n[[File:Gustavia Harbor, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.jpg|thumb|Gustavia Harbour]]\n\nGustavia is in a U-shaped cove facing the harbour on the west. The coastal arm of this cove is in a [[peninsula]] while the dockyard is on the east side.\n\nWhen the British invaded the harbour town in 1744{{Verify source|date=January 2011}}, the town\u2019s architectural buildings were destroyed.{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} Subsequently, new structures were built in the town around the harbour area{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} and the Swedes had also further added to the architectural beauty of the town in 1785 with more buildings, when they had occupied the town. Earlier to their occupation, the port was known as \"Car\u00e9nage\". The Swedes renamed it as Gustavia in honour of their king [[Gustav III]]. It was then their prime trading center. The port maintained a neutral stance since the Caribbean war was on in the 18th century. They used it as trading post of contraband and the city of [[Gustavia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Gustavia]] prospered but this prosperity was short lived.<ref name=Introduction/>\n\nThese buildings also underwent further destruction during the hurricanes and also by gutting in 1852. However, some monuments are still intact such as the residence of the then Swedish governor, now the town hall{{Verify source|date=January 2011}}. The oldest colonial structure in the town is stated to be the bell tower (now without a bell) built in 1799, as part of a church (destroyed in the past), in the southeast end of the town on Rue Du Presbytere. Now, a large clock is installed in place of the bell.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\nThe road that runs parallel to the harbour face of the sea called the Rue de la Republique and two other roads connect to the two arms of the U-shaped bay. The city has a network of roads, inherited from the Swedish period, that are laid in a grid pattern, which are either parallel or perpendicular to the three main roads that encompass the bay.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170\">Sullivan, p. 170</ref>\n\n====\u00c9glise anglicane de Gustavia====\n\u00c9glise anglicane de Gustavia, the [[Saint-Bartholomew Anglican Church]], is an important religious building in the town built in 1855 with stones brought from St Eustatius. It is on one of the most elegant roads of the town called the Rue du Centenaire. It has a bell tower. A rock wall encircles the church.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\n====Ancien presbyt\u00e8re de l'\u00e9glise catholique de Gustavia====\nAncien presbyt\u00e8re de l'\u00e9glise catholique de Gustavia is the Catholic Church built in 1822 is a replacement of the oldest church of the same name in Lorient.{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} This church also has a bell tower which is separated from the main church and which rings loud and clear.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\n====Mus\u00e9e Territorial de St.-Barth\u00e9lemy====\nMus\u00e9e Territorial de St.-Barth\u00e9lemy is a historical museum known as the \"St. Barts Municipal Museum\" also called the \"Wall House\" (mus\u00e9e \u2013 biblioth\u00e8que) in Gustavia, which is located on the far end of La Pointe. The museum is housed in an old stone house, a two-storey building which has been refurbished. The island\u2019s history relating to French, Swedish and British period of occupation is well presented in the museum with photographs, maps and paintings. Also on display are the ancestral costumes, antique tools, models of [[Creole peoples|Creole]] houses and ancient fishing boats.

One of these forts, known as Fort Oscar (formerly Gustav Adolph), which overlooks the sea is located on the far side of La Pointe. However, the ruins have been replaced by a modern military building which now houses the local gendarmerie. The other fort known as Fort Karl now presents a very few ruins. The third fort built by the Swedes is the Fort Gustav, which is also seen in ruins strewn around the weather station and the Light House. The fort built in 1787 over a hill slope has ruins of ramparts, guardhouse, munitions depot, wood-burning oven and so forth.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/><ref name=island/>\n\n===Savaku===\nA statue, \"Savaku\", representing the [[Arawak]] peoples is present at Saint-Jean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-barths.com/en/news/522/56/Inauguration-de-la-statue-en-bronze-placee-au-centre-du-rond-point-du-col-de-la-Tourmente.html |title=Inauguration de la statue en bronze plac\u00e9e au centre du rond-point du col de la Tourmente |author=C\u00e9cile Lucot |date=20 September 2007 |publisher=St Barths Online |accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Education==\nThe island's public preschools and primary schools, under the authority of the {{interlanguage link|Acad\u00e9mie de la Guadeloupe|fr}}, are:<ref name=PSlist>\"[http://www.ac-guadeloupe.fr/sites/default/files/liste_des_ecoles_publiques_et_privees_sous_contrat.pdf LISTE DES ECOLES PUBLIQUES ET PRIVEES SOUS CONTRAT].\" {{interlanguage link|Acad\u00e9mie de la Guadeloupe|fr}}.

In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty (1600 to 1050 BC) in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tomb of the Shang kings.\n\nJade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects,  from indoor decorative items to [[jade burial suit]]s. Jade was considered the \"imperial gem\". From the earliest [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] to the present, the jade deposits most in use were not only those of [[Khotan]] in the Western Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] but other parts of China as well, such as Lantian, [[Shaanxi]]. There, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the [[river]]s flowing from the [[Kuen-Lun mountain range]] eastward into the [[Takla-Makan desert]] area. The river jade collection is concentrated in the [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]], the White Jade ([[Yurungkash River|Yurungkash]]) and Black Jade ([[Karakash River|Karakash]]) Rivers. From the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], on the southern leg of the [[Silk Road]], yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there worked into ''objects d'art'' by skilled artisans as jade had a status-value exceeding that of [[gold]] or [[silver]]. Jade became a favourite material for the crafting of Chinese scholars' objects, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some [[opium pipe]]s, due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.<ref>Martin, Steven. ''The Art of Opium Antiques''. Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, 2007</ref>\n\nJadeite, with its bright emerald-green, pink, lavender, [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and brown colours was imported from [[Myanmar|Burma]] to China only after about 1800. The vivid green variety became known as Feicui (\u7fe1\u7fe0) or Kingfisher (feathers) Jade. It quickly became almost as popular as nephrite and a favorite of Qing Dynasty's nouveau riche, while scholars still had strong attachment to nephrite (white jade, or Khotan), which they deemed to be the symbol of a nobleman.\n\nIn the history of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, comparable with that of gold and [[diamond]]s in the West.<ref name=gem>[http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/jade.html Jade].

Jade is found in small numbers of [[pit-house]]s and [[burials]]. The craft production of small [[comma]]-shaped and tubular \"jades\" using materials such as jade, [[microcline]], [[jasper]], etc., in southern Korea originates from the Middle [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 850\u2013550 BC).<ref>Bale, Martin T. and Ko, Min-jung.

After the state of Silla united the Korean Peninsula in 668, the widespread popularisation of death rituals related to [[Buddhism]] resulted in the decline of the use of jade in burials as prestige mortuary goods.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{See also|Lingling-o}}\nToday, it is estimated that [[Myanmar]] is the origin of upwards of 70% of the world's supply of high-quality jadeite. Most of the jadeite mined in Myanmar is not cut for use in Myanmar, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The jadeite deposits found in Kachinland, in Myanmar's northern regions is the highest quality jadeite in the world, considered precious by sources in China going as far back as the 10th century.\n\n[[File:Bicephalous pendant (Jade), Artefacts of Phu Hoa site(Dong Nai province) 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture|Sa Hu\u1ef3nh]] [[white jade]] ''[[lingling-o]]'' double-headed pendant from [[Vietnam]]]]\nJadeite in Myanmar is primarily found in the \"Jade Tract\" located in Lonkin Township in Kachin State in northern Myanmar which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Se Za, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces Maw Sit Sit, a type of jade. Mines at Tawmao and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From to 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic Kachin State.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered two forms of jade that can be found across Taiwan through the Philippines, East Malaysia, central and southern Vietnam, and even extending to eastern Cambodia and peninsular Thailand. These two forms are called [[lingling-o]] penannular earring with three pointed circumferential projections and the double animal-headed ear pendant. The forms are very similar in size and range from about 30\u201335&nbsp;mm in diameter. Furthermore, radiocarbon dates have dated these forms in Southeast Asia from around 500 BC to 500 AD.<ref name=\"Hung et al\">Hung, H. C.; Iizuka, Y.; Bellwood, P.; Nguyen, K.

Once the boulders are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws.

The higher the iron content, the greener the color.\n\n[[Jadeite]] is a sodium- and aluminium-rich [[pyroxene]]. This, the more precious kind of jade is a microcrystalline interlocking growth of crystals (not a fibrous matrix as Nephrite is.)\n\nBoth nephrite and jadeite were used from [[prehistoric]] periods for [[hardstone carving]]. Jadeite has about the same [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]] (between 6.0 and 7.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]]) as quartz, while nephrite is slightly softer (6.0 to 6.5) and so can be worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} However nephrite is tougher and more resistant to breakage.

Jade was considered the \"imperial gem\". From the earliest [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] to the present, the jade deposits most in use were not only those of [[Khotan]] in the Western Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] but other parts of China as well, such as Lantian, [[Shaanxi]]. There, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the [[river]]s flowing from the [[Kuen-Lun mountain range]] eastward into the [[Takla-Makan desert]] area.

From the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], on the southern leg of the [[Silk Road]], yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there worked into ''objects d'art'' by skilled artisans as jade had a status-value exceeding that of [[gold]] or [[silver]]. Jade became a favourite material for the crafting of Chinese scholars' objects, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some [[opium pipe]]s, due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.<ref>Martin, Steven. ''The Art of Opium Antiques''. Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, 2007</ref>\n\nJadeite, with its bright emerald-green, pink, lavender, [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and brown colours was imported from [[Myanmar|Burma]] to China only after about 1800. The vivid green variety became known as Feicui (\u7fe1\u7fe0) or Kingfisher (feathers) Jade. It quickly became almost as popular as nephrite and a favorite of Qing Dynasty's nouveau riche, while scholars still had strong attachment to nephrite (white jade, or Khotan), which they deemed to be the symbol of a nobleman.\n\nIn the history of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, comparable with that of gold and [[diamond]]s in the West.<ref name=gem>[http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/jade.html Jade]. Gemstone.org</ref> Jade was used for the finest objects and cult figures, and for grave furnishings for high-ranking members of the imperial family.<ref name=gem/> Due to that significance and the rising middle class in China, in 2010 the finest jade when found in nuggets of \"mutton fat\" jade \u2013 so-named for its marbled white consistency \u2013 could sell for $3,000 an ounce, a tenfold increase from a decade previously.<ref name=\"Andrew Jabobs\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/world/asia/21jade.html?_r=2&hp& |title=Jade From China's West Surpasses Gold in Value |first=Andrew |last=Jacobs |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 20, 2010 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese character \u7389<ref>[[:zh:\u7389]]</ref> (y\u00f9) is used to denote the several types of stone known in English as \"jade\" (e.g. \u7389\u5668, jadewares), such as [[jadeite]] (\u786c\u7389, 'hard jade', another name for \u7fe1\u7fe0) and [[nephrite]] (\u8edf\u7389, 'soft jade').

Jade is found in small numbers of [[pit-house]]s and [[burials]]. The craft production of small [[comma]]-shaped and tubular \"jades\" using materials such as jade, [[microcline]], [[jasper]], etc., in southern Korea originates from the Middle [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 850\u2013550 BC).<ref>Bale, Martin T. and Ko, Min-jung. Craft Production and Social Change in Mumun Pottery Period Korea. ''Asian Perspectives'' 45(2):159\u2013187, 2006.</ref> Comma-shaped jades are found on some of the gold crowns of [[Silla]] royalty (c.  300/400\u2013668 AD) and sumptuous [[elite]] burials of the [[Korean Three Kingdoms]]. After the state of Silla united the Korean Peninsula in 668, the widespread popularisation of death rituals related to [[Buddhism]] resulted in the decline of the use of jade in burials as prestige mortuary goods.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{See also|Lingling-o}}\nToday, it is estimated that [[Myanmar]] is the origin of upwards of 70% of the world's supply of high-quality jadeite. Most of the jadeite mined in Myanmar is not cut for use in Myanmar, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The jadeite deposits found in Kachinland, in Myanmar's northern regions is the highest quality jadeite in the world, considered precious by sources in China going as far back as the 10th century.\n\n[[File:Bicephalous pendant (Jade), Artefacts of Phu Hoa site(Dong Nai province) 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture|Sa Hu\u1ef3nh]] [[white jade]] ''[[lingling-o]]'' double-headed pendant from [[Vietnam]]]]\nJadeite in Myanmar is primarily found in the \"Jade Tract\" located in Lonkin Township in Kachin State in northern Myanmar which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Se Za, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces Maw Sit Sit, a type of jade. Mines at Tawmao and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From to 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic Kachin State.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered two forms of jade that can be found across Taiwan through the Philippines, East Malaysia, central and southern Vietnam, and even extending to eastern Cambodia and peninsular Thailand. These two forms are called [[lingling-o]] penannular earring with three pointed circumferential projections and the double animal-headed ear pendant. The forms are very similar in size and range from about 30\u201335&nbsp;mm in diameter. Furthermore, radiocarbon dates have dated these forms in Southeast Asia from around 500 BC to 500 AD.<ref name=\"Hung et al\">Hung, H. C.; Iizuka, Y.; Bellwood, P.; Nguyen, K.

Evidence recovered from multiple sites from Taiwan, the Philippines, and the mainland southeast Asia suggests that Taiwan was the main source of the exchange of this kind of jade.

Jade is exposed using diamond-tipped core drills in order to extract samples. This is done to ensure that the jade meets requirements. Hydraulic spreaders are then inserted into cleavage points in the rock so that the jade can be broken away. Once the boulders are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws.

The higher the iron content, the greener the color.\n\n[[Jadeite]] is a sodium- and aluminium-rich [[pyroxene]]. This, the more precious kind of jade is a microcrystalline interlocking growth of crystals (not a fibrous matrix as Nephrite is.)\n\nBoth nephrite and jadeite were used from [[prehistoric]] periods for [[hardstone carving]]. Jadeite has about the same [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]] (between 6.0 and 7.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]]) as quartz, while nephrite is slightly softer (6.0 to 6.5) and so can be worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} However nephrite is tougher and more resistant to breakage.

Burma ([[Myanmar]]) and Guatemala are the principal sources of modern gem jadeite.

Some merchants will refer to these as grades, but degree of enhancement is different from colour and texture quality. In other words, Type A jadeite is not enhanced but can have poor colour and texture.

This results in a significant improvement of transparency and colour of the material. Currently, [[infrared spectroscopy]] is the most accurate test for the detection of polymer in jadeite.\n*'''Type C''' jade has been artificially stained or dyed. The effects are somewhat uncontrollable and may result in a dull brown. In any case, translucency is usually lost.\n*'''B+C jade''' is a combination of B and C: it has been both impregnated and artificially stained.\n*'''Type D''' jade refers to a composite stone such as a doublet comprising a jade top with a plastic backing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cheonmachong]] \u2013 Tumulus of the Silla kingdom in Korea, containing jade artifacts\n*{{annotated link|Costa Rican jade tradition}}\n*{{annotated link|Jade burial suit}}\n*{{annotated link|Jade trade in Myanmar}}\n*[[Mumun pottery period]] \u2013 Time in Korea when jade ornament production began\n*{{annotated link|Nephrite}}\n*{{annotated link|Philippine jade artifacts}}\n*[[Pounamu]] \u2013 Type of hard stone found in New Zealand, some of which are nephrite\n*[[Serpentine subgroup]] \u2013 Group of minerals, some of which are known as false jade\n*Name of 35th [[wedding anniversary]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* R\u00e9musat, Abel, 1820.

Allen]] and [[Harry Haywood]]) to help form the [[Communist Labor Party of North America|Provisional Organizing Committee to Reconstitute the Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Party]] (POC). He was expelled from the POC in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|author=Noel Ignatin |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/1956-1960/ignatin01.htm |title=The POC: A Personal Memoir |publisher=Theoretical Review #12 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe later became involved in the [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. When that organization fractured in the late 1960s, Ignatiev became part of the group [[Sojourner Truth Organization]] (STO) in 1970. Unlike other groups in the New Communist movement, the STO and Ignatiev were also heavily influenced by the ideas of Trinidadian writer [[C. L. R. James]].\n\nFor twenty years, Ignatiev worked in a [[Gary, Indiana]] [[steel mill]] and also in the manufacturing of farming equipment and electrical components. A [[Marxist]] activist, he was involved in efforts by African American steel workers to achieve equality in the mills. In 1984, he was [[layoff|laid off]] from the steel mill, approximately a year after an arrest on charges of attacking a strike-breaker's car with a paint bomb.<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n== Academic career ==\nIgnatiev set up Marxist discussion groups in the early 1980s. In 1985, Ignatiev was accepted to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] without an undergraduate degree. After earning his master's degree, he joined the Harvard faculty as a lecturer and worked toward a doctorate in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]].\n\nIgnatiev was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] where he earned his Ph.D. in 1995. He taught courses there before moving to the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design|Massachusetts College of Art]]. His academic work was linked to his call to \"abolish\" the [[white race]], a controversial slogan whose meaning is not always agreed upon by those who debate his work. His dissertation, published by [[Routledge]] as the book ''How the Irish Became White'', was advised by prominent social historian of American race and ethnicity [[Stephan Thernstrom]]. Ignatiev was the co-founder and co-editor of the journal ''Race Traitor'' and the ''New Abolitionist Society''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/naindex.html|title=New Abolitionist Society|website=racetraitor.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Ideas and controversies ==\n=== Views of race ===\nIgnatiev viewed race distinctions and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] itself as a [[social construct]], not a scientific reality.<ref>Smedley, Audrey (2007-March-14-17). \"[http://www.understandingrace.org/resources/pdf/disease/smedley.pdf The History of the Idea of Race... and Why It Matters]\". presented at the conference \"Race, Human Variation and Disease: Consensus and Frontiers\" sponsored by the American Anthropological Association (AAA).\nSober, Elliott (2000).

Ignatiev asserted that the Irish were not initially accepted as white by the dominant English-American population. He claimed that only through their own violence against free blacks and support of slavery did the Irish gain acceptance as white. Ignatiev defined [[whiteness studies|whiteness]] as the access to [[white privilege]], which according to Ignatiev gains people perceived to have \"white\" skin admission to certain neighborhoods, schools, and jobs. In the 19th century, whiteness was strongly associated with political power, especially [[suffrage]]. Ignatiev's book on Irish immigrants has been criticized for \"conflat[ing] race and economic position\" and for ignoring data that contradicts his theses.<ref name=\"Arnesen2001\"/>\n\nIgnatiev stated that attempts to give race a biological foundation have only led to absurdities as in the common example that a white woman could give birth to a black child, but a black woman could never give birth to a white child.<ref name=Routledge/> Ignatiev asserted that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories.\n\n=== \"New abolition\" and the \"white race\" ===\nIgnatiev's web site and publication ''Race Traitor'' displayed the motto \"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\". In response to a letter to the site which understood the motto as meaning that the authors \"hated\" white people because of their \"white skin\", Ignatiev and the other editors responded:\n{{quote|We do not hate you or anyone else for the color of her skin. What we hate is a system that confers privileges (and burdens) on people because of their color. It is not fair skin that makes people white; it is fair skin in a certain kind of society, one that attaches social importance to skin color. When we say we want to abolish the white race, we do not mean we want to exterminate people with fair skin. We mean that we want to do away with the social meaning of skin color, thereby abolishing the white race as a social category. Consider this parallel: To be against royalty does not mean wanting to kill the king. It means wanting to do away with crowns, thrones, titles, and the privileges attached to them. In our view, whiteness has a lot in common with royalty: they are both social formations that carry unearned advantages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/ |title=Racetraitor.org |publisher=Racetraitor.org |date= |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nIn September 2002, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' published an excerpt from ''When Race Becomes Real: Black and White Writers Confront Their Personal Histories'', edited by Bernestine Singley, about Ignatiev's role in launching ''Race Traitor''.<ref name=HarvardMagazine>{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/2002/09/abolish-the-white-race.html |title=Abolish the White Race |date=September\u2013October 2002 |work=[[Harvard Magazine]] |department=The Browser |accessdate=March 7, 2016 }}</ref> In the excerpt, Ignatiev wrote that \"[t]he goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> He wrote that the magazine's editors were frequently accused of being racists or part of a hate group, to which his \"standard response\" was \"to draw an analogy with anti-royalism: to oppose monarchy does not mean killing the king; it means getting rid of crowns, thrones, royal titles, etc.\"<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> Ignatiev also wrote that \"[t]he editors meant it when they replied to a reader, 'Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as \"the white race\" is destroyed\u2014not \"deconstructed\" but destroyed'\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/>\n\nSome conservative critics, particularly [[David Horowitz]], saw the excerpt as an example of [[institutional racism]] against white people at Harvard, in \"progressive culture\" and in [[academia]].<ref name=WashTimes/> On his website, Horowitz wrote: \"Suppose [[Frontpagemagazine.com]] ran a headline 'Abolish the Black Race'? What do you think the reaction would be? But at Harvard, where demonizing whites is merely the standard curriculum, an article like this can appear in a glossy magazine whose cover story is 'Whither the Art Museum?'\".<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n=== Toaster controversy ===\nFrom 1986 until 1992, Ignatiev served as a tutor (academic adviser) for [[Dunster House]] at Harvard College. In early 1992, Ignatiev objected to the university's purchase of a toaster oven for the Dunster House dining hall that would be designated for [[Kosher foods|kosher]] use only. He insisted that cooking utensils with restricted use should be paid for by private funds. In a letter to the Harvard student newspaper, the ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', Ignatiev wrote: \"I regard anti-Semitism, like all forms of religious, ethnic and racial bigotry, as a crime against humanity and whoever calls me an anti-Semite will face a libel suit\".<ref>{{cite web|author=No Writer Attributed |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=229365 |title=No Toaster Subsidy |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=March 18, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDunster House subsequently declined to renew Ignatiev's contract, saying that his conduct during the dispute was \"unbecoming of a Harvard tutor\". Dunster co-master Hetty Liem said it was the job of a tutor \"to foster a sense of community and tolerance and to serve as a role model for the students\" and that Ignatiev had not done so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=222958 |title=Dunster Dismisses Vocal Tutor |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=May 11, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Encyclopedia of Race and Racism'' ===\nIn 2008, the [[American Jewish Committee]] objected to an encyclopedia article on [[Zionism]] that Ignatiev wrote for ''The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism''.<ref name=AJC>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110745.html AJC: Withdraw Zionism chapter in race book], December 10, 2008, Jewish Telegraphic Agency</ref> In the article, Ignatiev described [[Israel]] as a \"racial state, where rights are assigned on the basis of ascribed descent or the approval of the superior race\" and likened it to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Southern United States]] before the [[civil rights movement]].<ref>\"Zionism\", Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, Macmillan Press, 2007, pp 240\u2013244.</ref>\n\nThe American Jewish Committee cited numerous \"factual and historical inaccuracies\" in Ignatiev's article. The American Jewish Committee also questioned why the encyclopedia included an entry about Zionism, stating that it was the only nationalist movement with an article in the encyclopedia.<ref name=AJC/> Gideon Shimoni, Professor Emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, criticized the article as a \"litany of errors and distortions of fact\".<ref>Gideon Shimoni, [http://www.spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=4739 A Comment on the Entry \"Zionism\" in the Encyclopedia of Race and Racism], December 1, 2008.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the encyclopedia's publisher Gale announced the appointment of an independent committee to investigate \"the factual accuracy, scholarly basis, coverage, scope, and balance of every article\".

When that organization fractured in the late 1960s, Ignatiev became part of the group [[Sojourner Truth Organization]] (STO) in 1970. Unlike other groups in the New Communist movement, the STO and Ignatiev were also heavily influenced by the ideas of Trinidadian writer [[C. L. R. James]].\n\nFor twenty years, Ignatiev worked in a [[Gary, Indiana]] [[steel mill]] and also in the manufacturing of farming equipment and electrical components. A [[Marxist]] activist, he was involved in efforts by African American steel workers to achieve equality in the mills. In 1984, he was [[layoff|laid off]] from the steel mill, approximately a year after an arrest on charges of attacking a strike-breaker's car with a paint bomb.<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n== Academic career ==\nIgnatiev set up Marxist discussion groups in the early 1980s. In 1985, Ignatiev was accepted to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] without an undergraduate degree. After earning his master's degree, he joined the Harvard faculty as a lecturer and worked toward a doctorate in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]].\n\nIgnatiev was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] where he earned his Ph.D. in 1995. He taught courses there before moving to the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design|Massachusetts College of Art]]. His academic work was linked to his call to \"abolish\" the [[white race]], a controversial slogan whose meaning is not always agreed upon by those who debate his work. His dissertation, published by [[Routledge]] as the book ''How the Irish Became White'', was advised by prominent social historian of American race and ethnicity [[Stephan Thernstrom]]. Ignatiev was the co-founder and co-editor of the journal ''Race Traitor'' and the ''New Abolitionist Society''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/naindex.html|title=New Abolitionist Society|website=racetraitor.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Ideas and controversies ==\n=== Views of race ===\nIgnatiev viewed race distinctions and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] itself as a [[social construct]], not a scientific reality.<ref>Smedley, Audrey (2007-March-14-17). \"[http://www.understandingrace.org/resources/pdf/disease/smedley.pdf The History of the Idea of Race... and Why It Matters]\". presented at the conference \"Race, Human Variation and Disease: Consensus and Frontiers\" sponsored by the American Anthropological Association (AAA).\nSober, Elliott (2000).

Ignatiev asserted that the Irish were not initially accepted as white by the dominant English-American population. He claimed that only through their own violence against free blacks and support of slavery did the Irish gain acceptance as white. Ignatiev defined [[whiteness studies|whiteness]] as the access to [[white privilege]], which according to Ignatiev gains people perceived to have \"white\" skin admission to certain neighborhoods, schools, and jobs. In the 19th century, whiteness was strongly associated with political power, especially [[suffrage]]. Ignatiev's book on Irish immigrants has been criticized for \"conflat[ing] race and economic position\" and for ignoring data that contradicts his theses.<ref name=\"Arnesen2001\"/>\n\nIgnatiev stated that attempts to give race a biological foundation have only led to absurdities as in the common example that a white woman could give birth to a black child, but a black woman could never give birth to a white child.<ref name=Routledge/> Ignatiev asserted that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories.\n\n=== \"New abolition\" and the \"white race\" ===\nIgnatiev's web site and publication ''Race Traitor'' displayed the motto \"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\". In response to a letter to the site which understood the motto as meaning that the authors \"hated\" white people because of their \"white skin\", Ignatiev and the other editors responded:\n{{quote|We do not hate you or anyone else for the color of her skin. What we hate is a system that confers privileges (and burdens) on people because of their color. It is not fair skin that makes people white; it is fair skin in a certain kind of society, one that attaches social importance to skin color. When we say we want to abolish the white race, we do not mean we want to exterminate people with fair skin. We mean that we want to do away with the social meaning of skin color, thereby abolishing the white race as a social category. Consider this parallel: To be against royalty does not mean wanting to kill the king. It means wanting to do away with crowns, thrones, titles, and the privileges attached to them. In our view, whiteness has a lot in common with royalty: they are both social formations that carry unearned advantages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/ |title=Racetraitor.org |publisher=Racetraitor.org |date= |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nIn September 2002, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' published an excerpt from ''When Race Becomes Real: Black and White Writers Confront Their Personal Histories'', edited by Bernestine Singley, about Ignatiev's role in launching ''Race Traitor''.<ref name=HarvardMagazine>{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/2002/09/abolish-the-white-race.html |title=Abolish the White Race |date=September\u2013October 2002 |work=[[Harvard Magazine]] |department=The Browser |accessdate=March 7, 2016 }}</ref> In the excerpt, Ignatiev wrote that \"[t]he goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> He wrote that the magazine's editors were frequently accused of being racists or part of a hate group, to which his \"standard response\" was \"to draw an analogy with anti-royalism: to oppose monarchy does not mean killing the king; it means getting rid of crowns, thrones, royal titles, etc.\"<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> Ignatiev also wrote that \"[t]he editors meant it when they replied to a reader, 'Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as \"the white race\" is destroyed\u2014not \"deconstructed\" but destroyed'\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/>\n\nSome conservative critics, particularly [[David Horowitz]], saw the excerpt as an example of [[institutional racism]] against white people at Harvard, in \"progressive culture\" and in [[academia]].<ref name=WashTimes/> On his website, Horowitz wrote: \"Suppose [[Frontpagemagazine.com]] ran a headline 'Abolish the Black Race'? What do you think the reaction would be? But at Harvard, where demonizing whites is merely the standard curriculum, an article like this can appear in a glossy magazine whose cover story is 'Whither the Art Museum?'\".<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n=== Toaster controversy ===\nFrom 1986 until 1992, Ignatiev served as a tutor (academic adviser) for [[Dunster House]] at Harvard College. In early 1992, Ignatiev objected to the university's purchase of a toaster oven for the Dunster House dining hall that would be designated for [[Kosher foods|kosher]] use only. He insisted that cooking utensils with restricted use should be paid for by private funds. In a letter to the Harvard student newspaper, the ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', Ignatiev wrote: \"I regard anti-Semitism, like all forms of religious, ethnic and racial bigotry, as a crime against humanity and whoever calls me an anti-Semite will face a libel suit\".<ref>{{cite web|author=No Writer Attributed |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=229365 |title=No Toaster Subsidy |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=March 18, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDunster House subsequently declined to renew Ignatiev's contract, saying that his conduct during the dispute was \"unbecoming of a Harvard tutor\". Dunster co-master Hetty Liem said it was the job of a tutor \"to foster a sense of community and tolerance and to serve as a role model for the students\" and that Ignatiev had not done so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=222958 |title=Dunster Dismisses Vocal Tutor |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=May 11, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Encyclopedia of Race and Racism'' ===\nIn 2008, the [[American Jewish Committee]] objected to an encyclopedia article on [[Zionism]] that Ignatiev wrote for ''The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism''.<ref name=AJC>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110745.html AJC: Withdraw Zionism chapter in race book], December 10, 2008, Jewish Telegraphic Agency</ref> In the article, Ignatiev described [[Israel]] as a \"racial state, where rights are assigned on the basis of ascribed descent or the approval of the superior race\" and likened it to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Southern United States]] before the [[civil rights movement]].<ref>\"Zionism\", Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, Macmillan Press, 2007, pp 240\u2013244.</ref>\n\nThe American Jewish Committee cited numerous \"factual and historical inaccuracies\" in Ignatiev's article.
