Jorge, tired of being repeatedly passed over for [[Broadway (theater)|Broadway]] roles because of his lack of \"masculinity\", auditions as Ginger, his drag persona. When he is rejected again, he vows to make it on his own by any means. Katy's friend Josie moves to New York, where she is recruited by Alexander Cabot to be the first singer signed to his new label. However, her song is rejected, and Alex's spiteful sister Alexandra reveals her brother's womanizing ways; heartbroken, Josie quits the label. Katy's friend Francois hires her to work for him, but only until she is ready to open her own store.

The city is located between National Highways NH-53 and NH-30, about 17&nbsp;km  south-east of  the capital city [[Raipur]]. [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] separates Raipur and Nava Raipur.\n\nAbout half of the total acquired land is being used for public facilities; 23%  of the land would be reserved for government and educational institutions; and 30% of the land will be used for residential and economical purposes. The city is envisaged to accommodate about 560,000 people by phase III, i.e., within 2031 as per the Master Development Plan prepared by Naya [[Raipur]] Development Authority now Nava Raipur Development Authority. Provisions have been made for its expansion and to upgrade infrastructure in the future.\n\nNaya Raipur is India's seventh [[Planned community|planned city]] after [[Jamshedpur]] (Jharkhand), [[Bhubaneshwar]] (Odisha), [[Gandhinagar]] (Gujarat), [[Chandigarh]] (Punjab and Haryana), [[Navi Mumbai]] (Maharashtra), and [[Durgapur]] (West Bengal) and fourth among the capital cities.\n\n== Planning ==\n\nA comprehensive exercise was undertaken to find a perfect location for the city. An imaginary circle of 50&nbsp;km radius was drawn around [[Raipur]] and this massive area was divided into four quadrants.\n\nEach quadrant was analysed in context of regional development, existing development, climatic factors, flora and fauna, water resources, transport network etc. and the efforts yielded the present site southeast of Raipur at about 15&nbsp;km distance, close to Mana Airport. The site selection methodology and site profile are detailed.<ref name=\"adfogg.com\">[https://www.adfogg.com/tourist-places-in-raipur-nayaraipur/ Tourist places Raipur Nayaraipur]</ref>\n\n[[File:Secretariat in Naya Raipur.JPG|thumb|Mantralaya in Naya (New) Raipur]]\n\n== Nava Raipur Development Authority ==\n\nAfter the formation of the new state of Chhattisgarh in November 2000, the state government decided to create a well planned new city for Raipur. Hence a special area has been notified under section 64 of Nagar Tatha Gramnivesh Adhiniyam 1973.\n\nThe authority thus formed is the [[Capital Area Development Authority]] (CADA) which is now called the [[Naya Raipur Development Authority]] (NRDA). NRDA is the nodal agency undertaking comprehensive development of this [[Greenfield land|'greenfield']] city.\n\nChief executive officers are appointed by government and other officers and staff working under NRDA organisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/topmenu/aboutnrda.aspx |accessdate=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406202259/http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/topmenu/aboutnrda.aspx |archivedate=6 April 2009 }}</ref> [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer P.

Large areas would be brought under tree plantation, arrangements would be made for water conservation and waste water recycling, and non-conventional energy resources would be used to the maximum.<ref>[http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/VisionForDevelopment.aspx?ival=2]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n* It would reflect the rich heritage and culture of Chhattisgarh and India in its urban design and architecture. Special efforts would be taken to make it a people friendly and visitor friendly city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.com\">[https://realtimes.in/single.php?id=9125 |date=May 2013}}</ref>\n* The city's design would a promote sense of security and comfort among its citizens, especially women, children and the physically challenged.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.com\" />\n\n== Economic base ==\n\nThe main activity base of Naya Raipur would be the government/state capital functions. However, a diversification of economy is desirable, which would be attained through the following activities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/economic.aspx?ival=17 |accessdate=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007205255/http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/economic.aspx?ival=17 |archivedate=7 October 2008 }}</ref>\n* Software technology park\n* Gems, jewellery and other similar industries\n* Business offices\n* Health, education and research services\n* Regional recreational activities\n* Nandan Van Zoo & Safari\n* International cricket stadium\n* 5 star hotels\n* 18 hole golf course and golf villas\n* Museums\n* Art gallery and library\n* Garden\n* Botanical garden\n* Lakes\n\n== Planning methodology ==\n\nWhile venturing to prepare the development plan for Naya Raipur, basic studies were made in the form of a secondary survey of data on [[Chandigarh]] (the first planned capital of a state in independent India) and Raipur, the elder sister and the most important \u201corganic\u201d metropolis in the region.\n\nThe space quantum against each activity/work-centre was then ascertained going by the accepted thumb-rule of the concerned industry/trade/activity, to the case of capital complex, and exact figures of  government jobs were taken into consideration. The resultant space quantum was then allocated on two-dimension on the structure plan and final quantum, shape, location, was defined by exact boundaries/roads on the plan.\n\nWith iterations, the allocated spaces were again translated in terms of number of jobs and the total number of job in the city arrived at. With a population of 5.6 lakhs, the Naya Raipur City is expected to generate approximately 2.2 lakh jobs, with an assumed workforce participation rate of 40%. The high standards of physical and social infrastructure adopted for the city will be able to cope with the maximum capacity of the city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.in\">[http://www.nayaraipur.in/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=53]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Roads ===\n* Length of proposed roads: 225&nbsp;km\n* Construction work on 71&nbsp;km of road has been started (100&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m row)\n* Construction agency: M/s B.

The city is located between National Highways NH-53 and NH-30, about 17&nbsp;km  south-east of  the capital city [[Raipur]]. [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] separates Raipur and Nava Raipur.\n\nAbout half of the total acquired land is being used for public facilities; 23%  of the land would be reserved for government and educational institutions; and 30% of the land will be used for residential and economical purposes. The city is envisaged to accommodate about 560,000 people by phase III, i.e., within 2031 as per the Master Development Plan prepared by Naya [[Raipur]] Development Authority now Nava Raipur Development Authority. Provisions have been made for its expansion and to upgrade infrastructure in the future.\n\nNaya Raipur is India's seventh [[Planned community|planned city]] after [[Jamshedpur]] (Jharkhand), [[Bhubaneshwar]] (Odisha), [[Gandhinagar]] (Gujarat), [[Chandigarh]] (Punjab and Haryana), [[Navi Mumbai]] (Maharashtra), and [[Durgapur]] (West Bengal) and fourth among the capital cities.\n\n== Planning ==\n\nA comprehensive exercise was undertaken to find a perfect location for the city. An imaginary circle of 50&nbsp;km radius was drawn around [[Raipur]] and this massive area was divided into four quadrants.\n\nEach quadrant was analysed in context of regional development, existing development, climatic factors, flora and fauna, water resources, transport network etc. and the efforts yielded the present site southeast of Raipur at about 15&nbsp;km distance, close to Mana Airport.

Hence a special area has been notified under section 64 of Nagar Tatha Gramnivesh Adhiniyam 1973.\n\nThe authority thus formed is the [[Capital Area Development Authority]] (CADA) which is now called the [[Naya Raipur Development Authority]] (NRDA). NRDA is the nodal agency undertaking comprehensive development of this [[Greenfield land|'greenfield']] city.\n\nChief executive officers are appointed by government and other officers and staff working under NRDA organisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/topmenu/aboutnrda.aspx |accessdate=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406202259/http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/topmenu/aboutnrda.aspx |archivedate=6 April 2009 }}</ref> [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer P.

The resultant space quantum was then allocated on two-dimension on the structure plan and final quantum, shape, location, was defined by exact boundaries/roads on the plan.\n\nWith iterations, the allocated spaces were again translated in terms of number of jobs and the total number of job in the city arrived at. With a population of 5.6 lakhs, the Naya Raipur City is expected to generate approximately 2.2 lakh jobs, with an assumed workforce participation rate of 40%. The high standards of physical and social infrastructure adopted for the city will be able to cope with the maximum capacity of the city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.in\">[http://www.nayaraipur.in/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=53]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Roads ===\n* Length of proposed roads: 225&nbsp;km\n* Construction work on 71&nbsp;km of road has been started (100&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m row)\n* Construction agency: M/s B.

Retrieved 9 October 2019.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nOlsson had his international breakthrough in 2001 when he won silver at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics]]. He has the Swedish national record outdoors, 17.79 m ([[2004 Summer Olympics]]), and the Swedish national record indoors, 17.83 m (2004). Olsson has won the Swedish Championships seven times, and has also competed successfully on national level in [[high jump]]ing.\n\nOn 7 March 2004, at the [[2004 World Indoor Championships in Athletics]], he jumped 17.83 m and matched the [[World Record]]. On 23 August 2004, at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], he jumped 17.79 m, broke the national record and won the gold medal. Four of his six jumps were longer than the silver medalist's best jump.\n\nWith the Olympic Gold he completed a rare international sweep, having the Olympic, World Indoor, Outdoor, Regional (European) Indoor and Outdoor titles.\n\nOlsson first became interested in triple jump after watching [[Jonathan Edwards (triple jumper)|Jonathan Edwards]] set the world record at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in his hometown Gothenburg. Since 1999, Olsson has been trained by [[Yannick Tregaro]]. Before that, Olsson was trained by [[Viljo Nousiainen]].\n\nDuring the autumn and winter 2004/2005 he injured his foot (an injury originating from the 2004 Olympic Final), preventing him from being able to do triple-jumping at full speed. Unfortunately the injury has healed very slowly, and it was still in January 2006 hampering him. In his first competition after the injury, in June 2006, he jumped 17.09 and seem to be back into shape.<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/news/news/christian-olsson-is-back Christian Olsson is back!] IAAF, 13 June 2006.

is a former [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]] competing in [[high jump]] and [[triple jump]]. He won an Olympic gold medal, one gold and one silver medal in the World Championships and two gold medals in the European Championships as well as a further two golds in the World Indoor championships. He also won the overall [[IAAF Golden League]] jackpot in 2004 where he cashed in 500,000 US dollars (after splitting the million dollar pot with [[Tonique Williams-Darling]]).\n\nFrom 2007 to his retirement in 2012, he was beset by injuries which left him largely on the sidelines and unable to compete at top level competitions.<ref>Turner, Chris (16 January 2010).

[[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]]. Retrieved 9 October 2019.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nOlsson had his international breakthrough in 2001 when he won silver at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics]]. He has the Swedish national record outdoors, 17.79 m ([[2004 Summer Olympics]]), and the Swedish national record indoors, 17.83 m (2004). Olsson has won the Swedish Championships seven times, and has also competed successfully on national level in [[high jump]]ing.\n\nOn 7 March 2004, at the [[2004 World Indoor Championships in Athletics]], he jumped 17.83 m and matched the [[World Record]]. On 23 August 2004, at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], he jumped 17.79 m, broke the national record and won the gold medal. Four of his six jumps were longer than the silver medalist's best jump.\n\nWith the Olympic Gold he completed a rare international sweep, having the Olympic, World Indoor, Outdoor, Regional (European) Indoor and Outdoor titles.\n\nOlsson first became interested in triple jump after watching [[Jonathan Edwards (triple jumper)|Jonathan Edwards]] set the world record at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in his hometown Gothenburg. Since 1999, Olsson has been trained by [[Yannick Tregaro]]. Before that, Olsson was trained by [[Viljo Nousiainen]].\n\nDuring the autumn and winter 2004/2005 he injured his foot (an injury originating from the 2004 Olympic Final), preventing him from being able to do triple-jumping at full speed. Unfortunately the injury has healed very slowly, and it was still in January 2006 hampering him. In his first competition after the injury, in June 2006, he jumped 17.09 and seem to be back into shape.<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/news/news/christian-olsson-is-back Christian Olsson is back!] IAAF, 13 June 2006. Retrieved 9 October 2019.</ref>\nA month later he won the gold medal at [[2006 European Championships in Athletics|European Championships]] in his hometown Gothenburg, with a jump of 17.67 m.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 indoor season, Olsson was injured yet again, and was unable to compete at the [[2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships|European indoor championships]].<ref>[https://www.iaaf.org/news/news/robles-flies-as-vlasic-holm-and-thornblad-soa Knee injury in training causes Olsson\u2019s withdrawal] IAAF. 1 February 2007.

It was founded by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] who called it ''Visva-Bharati'', which means the communion of the world with India. Until independence it was a college. Soon after independence, in 1951, the institution was given the status of a university and was renamed Visva-Bharati University.\n\n==Overview==\n''[[The Hindu]]'' writes, \"Santiniketan in many ways is still quite different compared to other universities in the country. Located at Bolpur in Birbhum district of West Bengal, the university still has the rural trappings that Tagore dreamt of. The classes are still held in the open under the shade of huge mango trees and students and tutors alike still travel by cycles to keep pollution at bay. The old buildings, even those that were made up of mud walls and thatched roofs, are still intact and find a place within the main campus. While some are preserved for historical value, others are functional in all aspects. While for tourists the place could only be place for sight-seeing, the studious and the academically-inclined can easily feel the scholastic vibrations. Many, especially the Bengalis, have deep reverence for the place and take the visit as a pilgrimage to pay their respects to Tagore. Almost every festival, be it the local \u2018 Poush mela' or the more universal \u2018Raksha Bandhan' or \u2018Holi,' is celebrated in its originality by the students, locals and staff on the campus... Tagore visualised it as a \u2018seat of learning', and his vision was taken forward by Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru. Both played a stellar role in its becoming a Central University in 1951.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/tagores-vision-of-an-institution/article2987625.ece| title = Tagore's Vision of an Institution |work= Colleges |first=Sumit| last= Bhattacharjee| publisher = The Hindu, 26 March 2012  |accessdate =  11 September 2019| date = 26 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visva-Bharati University 1971 stamp of India.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1971 stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Visva-Bharati University, featuring [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and university building]]\nThe origins of this university date back to 1863 when [[Debendranath Tagore]] was given a tract of land by the zamindar of [[Raipur, Birbhum|Raipur]], Lord Sinha family & Kirnahar  (sarkar family)\n\nand set up an ''[[ashram]]'' at the spot that has now come to be called ''chatim tala'' at the heart of the town. The ashram was initially called Brahmacharya Ashram, which was later renamed Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. It was established with a view to encouraging people from all walks of life to come to the spot and meditate. In 1901 his youngest son [[Rabindranath Tagore]] established a co-educational school inside the premises of the ashram.\n\nFrom 1901 onwards, Tagore used the ashram to organise the Hindu Mela, which soon became a centre of nationalist activity. Through the early twentieth century the zamindars of [[Surul]] (Sarkar Family), another neighbouring village, a few minutes by cycle from the Uttarayan Complex, and the zamindars of Taltore, a village just north of the university town, continued to sell their lands and other properties to the ashram and the college that was being built on this spot. The entire neighbourhood of Purbapalli belonged to the former zamindars of Taltore.\n[[File:Santiniketan Prayer Hall.jpg|right|thumb|''Upasana Griha'', prayer hall, built by [[Debendranath Tagore]] in 1863, Santiniketan]]\n\nRabindranath Tagore believed in open air education and had reservations about any teaching done within four walls. This was due to his belief that walls represent conditioning of mind. Tagore did not have a good opinion about the Western method of education introduced by the British in India; on this subject, Tagore and Gandhiji's opinion matched. Tagore once said, \"I do not remember what I was taught, I only remember what I learnt.\"\nTagore's idea on education was that every person is genius and that all students may not bloom at the same time. So he devised a new system of learning in Visva-Bharati. He allowed students to continue their course till the student and his teacher both are satisfied.\n\nAt Visva-Bharati University, if a course demanded by a student is not available, then the university will design a course and bring teachers for that course. The university would not be bothered by the consideration of whether there is a demand for the course.\n\n==Administration==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:85%; background:#ffc; color:black; width:20em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| [[Vice Chancellor|Upacharyas]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n*[[Rathindranath Tagore]], 1951\u20131953\n*[[Kshitimohan Sen]], 1953\u20131954 (acting)\n*[[Prabodh Chandra Bagchi]], 1954\u20131956\n*[[Indira Devi Chaudhurani]], 1956-1956 (acting)\n*[[Satyendranath Bose]], 1956\u20131958\n*[[Kshitishchandra Chaudhuri]], 1958\u20131959 (acting)\n*[[Sudhi Ranjan Das]], 1959\u20131965\n*[[Kalidas Bhattacharya]], 1966\u20131970\n*[[Pratul Chandra Gupta]], 1970\u20131975\n*[[Surajit Chandra Sinha]], 1975\u20131980\n*[[Amlan Dutta]], 1980\u20131984\n*[[Nemai Sadhan Bosu]], 1984\u20131989\n*[[Ajit Kumar Chakrabarty]], 1989\u20131990 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[Ashin Dasgupta]], 1990\u20131991\n*[[Sisir Mukhopadhyaya]], 1991-1991 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[Sabyasachi Bhattacharya]], 1991\u20131995\n*[[Sisir Mukhopadhyay]], 1995-1995 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[R.R.Rao]], 1995-1995 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[Dilip K.Sinha]], 1995\u20132001\n*[[Sujit Basu]], 2001\u20132006\n*[[Rajat Kanta Ray]], 2006\u20132011\n*[[Sushanta Kumar Dattagupta]], Sep 2011\u2013Feb 2016\n*[[Swapan Kumar Datta]], Feb 2016-Jan 2018 (Offg.)\n*[[Sabuj Kali Sen]], Feb 2018-Oct 2018 (Offg.)\n*[[Bidyut Chakrabarty]], Oct 2018-Till Date\n|}\n\nThe high officials of the university include the ''paridarshaka'' (visitor), ''acharya'' (chancellor), and the ''upacharya'' (vice chancellor).

It is the university school of Santiniketan. Initially called Ashram Vidyalaya it was later called Santiniketan Vidyalaya. It was started by Tagore in 1901. The distinctive features of this co-educational school include its open-air classrooms and emphasis upon oriental learning. The school, being the nucleus of the university and the town is within the Santiniketan Ashram. The first four students of the school included Tagore's son Rathindranath Tagore, the first upacharya of the university and [[Sudhi Ranjan Das]], a chief justice of India. The future Nobel Laureate in economics, [[Amartya Sen]], graduated from this school. So did one of the first Indian Rhodes scholars, Asim Datta. Supriyo Tagore, a great grandson of [[Satyendranath Tagore]], the eldest brother of the poet, was one of its longest serving and most well known Principals. The eminent historians, [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]] and Ashin Dasgupta have periodically taken classes here.\n*Mrinalini Ananda Pathsala: Founded in 1954, it was named after Rabindranath Tagore's wife Mrinalini Devi.

The towns and the university are not far from the river Kopai which flows to the south.\n\nThis university is especially famous for its cultural festivals:\n\n* Basanta Utsab (Spring Festival): This festival is identified with ''doljatra'' or ''holi'', which is held on the grounds in front of Patha Bhavana.\n* [[Poush Mela]] (Winter Fair): It is the annual winter fair which is held every ''Poush'' which coincides with December on ''Purono Melar Maath'' opposite the ashram and next to the Uttarayan complex, as well as on Melar Maath (Bhubandangar Maath), which is next to the administrative block. The fair is meant to encourage the local people of Birbhum and outlying districts to come and exhibit and sell their wares. ''Jatras'', such as [[Alkap]], are staged and Bouls perform at the fair. On the first day of the fair, (23 December), the university organises an Upasana Sabha at Chatimtala (under a chatim tree), the spot where Maharshi Debendranath Tagore established his ashram for the first time in 1863. On 24 December the university organises a display of lights and fireworks on Melar Maath, a custom started by the poet, Rabindranath Tagore himself. On Christmas Day, the university organises the Christo Utsab, which is meant as a mark of respect for all religions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Notable people associated with Santiniketan|Notable alumni of Visva- Bharati and persons associated with Santiniketan]]\n* [[Kala Bhavana]]\n* [[List of universities in India#West Bengal|List of universities in India]]\n* ''[[The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official}}\n*[https://santiniketantravelguide.com/what-to-see-in-santiniketan/ Places to visit in Visva-Bharati]\n\n{{IndianCentralUniv}}\n{{Universities in West Bengal}}\n{{Scientific Research in West Bengal}}\n{{Bengal Renaissance}}\n{{Rabindranath Tagore}}\n{{Santiniketan}}\n{{Birbhum topics}}\n\n[[Category:Visva-Bharati University|*]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Birbhum district]]\n[[Category:Art schools in India]]\n[[Category:Central universities in India]]\n[[Category:Memorials to Rabindranath Tagore]]\n[[Category:Rabindranath Tagore]]\n[[Category:Academic institutions associated with the Bengal Renaissance]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1921]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:1920s establishments in British India]]\n[[Category:Universities in West Bengal]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Public central university in Santiniketan, West Bengal, India}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2013}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2015}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Infobox university\n|name              = Visva-Bharati University\n|native_name       = \n|native_name_lang  = bn \n|image             = Visva-Bharati University Logo.svg\n|image_size        = \n|motto             = {{lang|sa-latn|Yatra Visvam Bhavatyekanidam}}{{small|([[Sanskrit]])}}\n|mottoeng          = Where the world makes a home in a single nest\n|established       = {{Start date and age|df=yes|23 December 1921}} \n|founder           = [[Rabindranath Tagore]]  \n|type              = [[Public university|Public]]\n|chancellor        = [[Prime Minister of India]]\n|vice_chancellor   = Professor Bidyut Chakrabarty<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bidyut-chakrabarty-takes-over-as-vc-of-visva-bharati-university/articleshow/66562972.cms |title=Bidyut Chakrabarty takes over as VC of Visva Bharati University 05:46 IST |date= 10 November 2018 |access-date=16 January 2019 |newspaper= The Times of India | location=India}}</ref>\n|students          = 5,631<ref name=\"caluniv1\">{{cite web |title=Visva Bharati - University Student Enrolment Details |url=https://www.ugc.ac.in/centralniversitylist.aspx?id=35&Unitype=1 |website=www.ugc.ac.in |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n|undergrad         = 2,755<ref name=\"caluniv1\"/>\n|postgrad          = 1,818<ref name=\"caluniv1\"/>\n|doctoral          =  \n|city              = [[Shantiniketan]]\n|state             = [[West Bengal]]\n|country           = [[India]]\n|coordinates       = {{coord|23|40|44|N|87|40|25|E|region:IN_type:edu|display=inline, title}} \n|campus            = [[Rural]]\n|affiliations      = [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]], [[National Assessment and Accreditation Council|NAAC]], [[Association of Indian Universities|AIU]], [[Association of Commonwealth Universities|ACU]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.acu.ac.uk/membership/acu-members/asia |title=Association of Commonwealth Universities Membars-Asia |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n|website           = {{url|http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/}}\n|logo              =\n}}\n\n'''Visva-Bharati University''' ({{IPA-bn|bi\u0283\u02d0\u0254b\u02b1aroti|lang}}) is a [[Public university|public]] [[Central University (India)|central university]] and an '''Institution of National Importance''' located in [[Santiniketan]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. It was founded by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] who called it ''Visva-Bharati'', which means the communion of the world with India. Until independence it was a college. Soon after independence, in 1951, the institution was given the status of a university and was renamed Visva-Bharati University.\n\n==Overview==\n''[[The Hindu]]'' writes, \"Santiniketan in many ways is still quite different compared to other universities in the country. Located at Bolpur in Birbhum district of West Bengal, the university still has the rural trappings that Tagore dreamt of. The classes are still held in the open under the shade of huge mango trees and students and tutors alike still travel by cycles to keep pollution at bay. The old buildings, even those that were made up of mud walls and thatched roofs, are still intact and find a place within the main campus. While some are preserved for historical value, others are functional in all aspects. While for tourists the place could only be place for sight-seeing, the studious and the academically-inclined can easily feel the scholastic vibrations. Many, especially the Bengalis, have deep reverence for the place and take the visit as a pilgrimage to pay their respects to Tagore. Almost every festival, be it the local \u2018 Poush mela' or the more universal \u2018Raksha Bandhan' or \u2018Holi,' is celebrated in its originality by the students, locals and staff on the campus... Tagore visualised it as a \u2018seat of learning', and his vision was taken forward by Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru. Both played a stellar role in its becoming a Central University in 1951.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/tagores-vision-of-an-institution/article2987625.ece| title = Tagore's Vision of an Institution |work= Colleges |first=Sumit| last= Bhattacharjee| publisher = The Hindu, 26 March 2012  |accessdate =  11 September 2019| date = 26 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visva-Bharati University 1971 stamp of India.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1971 stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Visva-Bharati University, featuring [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and university building]]\nThe origins of this university date back to 1863 when [[Debendranath Tagore]] was given a tract of land by the zamindar of [[Raipur, Birbhum|Raipur]], and he set up an ''[[ashram]]'' at the spot that has now come to be called ''chatim tala'' at the heart of the town. The ashram was initially called Brahmacharya Ashram, which was later renamed Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. It was established with a view to encouraging people from all walks of life to come to the spot and meditate. In 1901 his youngest son [[Rabindranath Tagore]] established a co-educational school inside the premises of the ashram.\n\nFrom 1901 onwards, Tagore used the ashram to organise the Hindu Mela, which soon became a centre of nationalist activity. Through the early twentieth century the zamindars of [[Surul]] (Sarkar Family), another neighbouring village, a few minutes by cycle from the Uttarayan Complex, and the zamindars of Taltore, a village just north of the university town, continued to sell their lands and other properties to the ashram and the college that was being built on this spot. The entire neighbourhood of Purbapalli belonged to the former zamindars of Taltore.\n[[File:Santiniketan Prayer Hall.jpg|right|thumb|''Upasana Griha'', prayer hall, built by [[Debendranath Tagore]] in 1863, Santiniketan]]\n\nRabindranath Tagore believed in open air education and had reservations about any teaching done within four walls. This was due to his belief that walls represent conditioning of mind. Tagore did not have a good opinion about the Western method of education introduced by the British in India; on this subject, Tagore and Gandhiji's opinion matched. Tagore once said, \"I do not remember what I was taught, I only remember what I learnt.\"\nTagore's idea on education was that every person is genius and that all students may not bloom at the same time. So he devised a new system of learning in Visva-Bharati. He allowed students to continue their course till the student and his teacher both are satisfied.\n\nAt Visva-Bharati University, if a course demanded by a student is not available, then the university will design a course and bring teachers for that course. The university would not be bothered by the consideration of whether there is a demand for the course.\n\n==Administration==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:85%; background:#ffc; color:black; width:20em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| [[Vice Chancellor|Upacharyas]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n*[[Rathindranath Tagore]], 1951\u20131953\n*[[Kshitimohan Sen]], 1953\u20131954 (acting)\n*[[Prabodh Chandra Bagchi]], 1954\u20131956\n*[[Indira Devi Chaudhurani]], 1956-1956 (acting)\n*[[Satyendranath Bose]], 1956\u20131958\n*[[Kshitishchandra Chaudhuri]], 1958\u20131959 (acting)\n*[[Sudhi Ranjan Das]], 1959\u20131965\n*[[Kalidas Bhattacharya]], 1966\u20131970\n*[[Pratul Chandra Gupta]], 1970\u20131975\n*[[Surajit Chandra Sinha]], 1975\u20131980\n*[[Amlan Dutta]], 1980\u20131984\n*[[Nemai Sadhan Bosu]], 1984\u20131989\n*[[Ajit Kumar Chakrabarty]], 1989\u20131990 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[Ashin Dasgupta]], 1990\u20131991\n*[[Sisir Mukhopadhyaya]], 1991-1991 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[Sabyasachi Bhattacharya]], 1991\u20131995\n*[[Sisir Mukhopadhyay]], 1995-1995 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[R.R.Rao]], 1995-1995 (performed the duty of upacharya)\n*[[Dilip K.Sinha]], 1995\u20132001\n*[[Sujit Basu]], 2001\u20132006\n*[[Rajat Kanta Ray]], 2006\u20132011\n*[[Sushanta Kumar Dattagupta]], Sep 2011\u2013Feb 2016\n*[[Swapan Kumar Datta]], Feb 2016-Jan 2018 (Offg.)\n*[[Sabuj Kali Sen]], Feb 2018-Oct 2018 (Offg.)\n*[[Bidyut Chakrabarty]], Oct 2018-Till Date\n|}\n\nThe high officials of the university include the ''paridarshaka'' (visitor), ''acharya'' (chancellor), and the ''upacharya'' (vice chancellor).

The first four students of the school included Tagore's son Rathindranath Tagore, the first upacharya of the university and [[Sudhi Ranjan Das]], a chief justice of India. The future Nobel Laureate in economics, [[Amartya Sen]], graduated from this school. So did one of the first Indian Rhodes scholars, Asim Datta. Supriyo Tagore, a great grandson of [[Satyendranath Tagore]], the eldest brother of the poet, was one of its longest serving and most well known Principals. The eminent historians, [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]] and Ashin Dasgupta have periodically taken classes here.\n*Mrinalini Ananda Pathsala: Founded in 1954, it was named after Rabindranath Tagore's wife Mrinalini Devi. It is a preparatory school for Patha Bhavana. It is housed in the Notun Bari and Dehali.\n*Santosh Pathsala: Founded in 1988, it is a kindergarten named after Santosh Chandra Majumdar. It is a preparatory school for [[Siksha Satra]].\n*[[Siksha Satra]]: It was founded in 1924. It was later shifted to Sriniketan in 1927. The students are from the neighbouring villages.\n*Uttar Shiksha Sadana: This school was started in 1976.\n\n===Rankings===\n{{Infobox India university ranking\n| NIRF_U_2018 = 31\n| NIRF_O_2018 = 48\n| NIRF_U_2019 = 37\n| NIRF_O_2019 = 59\n}}\nThe [[National Institutional Ranking Framework]] (NIRF) ranked Visva-Bharati University 48 overall in India<ref name=Rankings_NIRF_O_2018/> and 31 among universities in India.<ref name=Rankings_NIRF_U_2018/> According to Best Global Universities 2020 ranking produced by [[U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking|U.S. News & World Report]], Visva- Bharati ranked 4th among Indian universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/search?region=&country=india&subject=&name=|title=Best Global Universities, 2020 by US News & World Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Library==\nVisva-Bharati Library was established in 1901, at the time of foundation of the Brahmacharya Asrama at Santiniketan by Rabindranath Tagore. Presently, Visva-Bharati Library System has a Central Library, 12 Sectional libraries attached with Cheena-Bhavana, Siksha-Bhavana, Patha-Bhavana, Darshan Sadan, Hindi-Bhavana, Sangit-Bhavana, Palli Sangathan Vibhaga, Vinaya-Bhavana, Rabindra-Bhavana, Palli Siksha Bhavana, Kala-Bhavana and Siksha-Satra. Moreover, around 30 Seminar Libraries are in operation attached to different departments. \n[[File:Visva-Bharati Central Library.jpg|thumb|210px|Visva-Bharati Central Library]]\n\nVisva-Bharati library contains old and rare documents, which include multi-lingual and multi-discipline books, reports, manuscripts, etc. The library also has a number of important collections; mention may be made of the collections of Rabindranath Tagore, Prabodh Chandra.\n\n==Guest houses==\nThe university has two guest houses: Ratan Palli (named after the eminent early twentieth century industrialist and scion of Tata family, Sir [[Ratan Tata]]) and Purba Palli.\n\n==Campus life==\n[[File:Poush Mela Bazaar 2012.jpg|thumb|220px|Poush Mela Bazaar, 2012]]\nThe twin towns of Santiniketan and Sriniketan are surrounded by [[Bolpur]] to the north, Kheya to the south, [[Surul]] to the east and [[Prantik]] to the west. The towns and the university are not far from the river Kopai which flows to the south.\n\nThis university is especially famous for its cultural festivals:\n\n* Basanta Utsab (Spring Festival): This festival is identified with ''doljatra'' or ''holi'', which is held on the grounds in front of Patha Bhavana.\n* [[Poush Mela]] (Winter Fair): It is the annual winter fair which is held every ''Poush'' which coincides with December on ''Purono Melar Maath'' opposite the ashram and next to the Uttarayan complex, as well as on Melar Maath (Bhubandangar Maath), which is next to the administrative block. The fair is meant to encourage the local people of Birbhum and outlying districts to come and exhibit and sell their wares. ''Jatras'', such as [[Alkap]], are staged and Bouls perform at the fair. On the first day of the fair, (23 December), the university organises an Upasana Sabha at Chatimtala (under a chatim tree), the spot where Maharshi Debendranath Tagore established his ashram for the first time in 1863. On 24 December the university organises a display of lights and fireworks on Melar Maath, a custom started by the poet, Rabindranath Tagore himself. On Christmas Day, the university organises the Christo Utsab, which is meant as a mark of respect for all religions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Notable people associated with Santiniketan|Notable alumni of Visva- Bharati and persons associated with Santiniketan]]\n* [[Kala Bhavana]]\n* [[List of universities in India#West Bengal|List of universities in India]]\n* ''[[The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official}}\n*[https://santiniketantravelguide.com/what-to-see-in-santiniketan/ Places to visit in Visva-Bharati]\n\n{{IndianCentralUniv}}\n{{Universities in West Bengal}}\n{{Scientific Research in West Bengal}}\n{{Bengal Renaissance}}\n{{Rabindranath Tagore}}\n{{Santiniketan}}\n{{Birbhum topics}}\n\n[[Category:Visva-Bharati University|*]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Birbhum district]]\n[[Category:Art schools in India]]\n[[Category:Central universities in India]]\n[[Category:Memorials to Rabindranath Tagore]]\n[[Category:Rabindranath Tagore]]\n[[Category:Academic institutions associated with the Bengal Renaissance]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1921]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:1920s establishments in British India]]\n[[Category:Universities in West Bengal]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4060:2104:173a:1786:e8a5:52a6:83fd", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(New)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visva-Bharati_University"}

Between Wellington and Dubbo extensive flat areas are evident.\n*north of Dubbo, the Talbragar River joins the Macquarie. The Talbragar is the most important downstream tributary. This river rises in mountainous country at the junction of the Great Dividing Range and the [[Liverpool Range]]. The country through which the Talbragar River runs is broad and flat, bordered by undulating hills that disperse as the river nears Dubbo.\n*north of Dubbo, the river passes through flat plains flowing north-west through Narromine and Warren. A complex series of effluent creeks connect the Macquarie, Darling and Bogan Rivers.\n*Macquarie Marshes lie at the end of the river channel proper. Near [[Carinda, New South Wales|Carinda]], the Macquarie is joined by Marthaguy Creek which drains an area {{convert|6500|km2}} and carries spill-over water from the Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers during floods.\n\n===Rainfall===\nRainfall varies across the catchment of the Macquarie River. Generally the peaks and tablelands receive higher rainfall due to the shadowing effects of the surrounding ranges. The Great Dividing Range area receives between {{convert|750|mm}} and {{convert|900|mm}} annual median rainfall. This is distributed relatively uniformly throughout the year. Where breaks in the Dividing Range allow the intrusion of moist easterly air streams inland, annual median rainfall of {{convert|750|mm}} or more is experienced further westward. Further north-west in the Castlereagh and middle portions of the Macquarie valleys the annual median rainfall is {{convert|300|mm}} to {{convert|400|mm}}.<ref name=\"anra\" />\n\nRainfall can vary dramatically over several years. For example, records show a variation from >200% to <50% of the average annual figure. Evaporation varies from less than {{convert|1000|mm}} south-east of Bathurst up to more than {{convert|2000|mm}} at [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]].<ref name=\"anra\" />\n\n==Statistics==\n<center>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|+ '''River Catchment Statistics (May 2009)<ref name=\"anra\" />'''\n|- bgcolor=#6495ED\n|-\n|Area Total\n|{{convert|12,300|km\u00b2}}\n|-\n|Total storage volume\n|{{convert|1,559,620|ML}}\n|-\n|Total surface water use\n|406,840 ML/yr\n|-\n|Development Category\n|overdeveloped\n|-\n|Mean annual run-off\n|0 ML/yr\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n==History==\n===Aboriginal history===\nThe [[Wiradjuri]] people are the original inhabitants of the area that includes the Macquarie River catchment.<ref name=wiradjuri>{{cite web|url=http://www.mldrin.org.au/membership/wiradjuri.htm|title=Indigenous Nations|publisher=Murray Lower Darling Indigenous Nations|accessdate=21 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130049/http://www.mldrin.org.au/membership/wiradjuri.htm|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Wiradjuri knew the river as the Wambool, which means \"winding river\".<ref name=wambool>{{cite web |url=http://www.bathurst.nsw.gov.au/community/community-services/indigenous-people/190-indigenous-people.html |title=Indigenous People |publisher=Bathurst Regional Council |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306082649/https://www.bathurst.nsw.gov.au/community/community-services/indigenous-people/190-indigenous-people.html |archivedate=6 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The noted Wiradjuri warrior [[Windradyne]] came from the upper Macquarie River region, and was fatally wounded from a gun shot after a man hunt was commissioned by the crown in 1829.<ref name=adb>{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=David Andrew |title=Windradyne (c. 1800 - 1829) |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10494b.htm |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Online Edition |publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University |accessdate=3 May 2007 |year=2005}}</ref> Near Carinda, between the Macquarie River and Marra Creek, the oldest evidence of bread making in the world (approximately 30,000 years old) was found at an ancient lake known as [[Cuddie Springs]].<ref name=cuddie-springs>{{cite web |url=http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/aboriginal-history-timeline.html#ixzz1EZYjyovD |title=Australian Aboriginal history timeline: Ancient history |work=Aboriginal Culture |author=Korff, Jeff |publisher=Creative Spirits |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215213443/http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/aboriginal-history-timeline.html#ixzz1EZYjyovD |archivedate=15 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===European history===\nThe upper reaches of the Macquarie River were first seen by Europeans in 1813 and the river was named in honour of the then Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, Lieutenant-Colonel (later [[Major-General]]) Lachlan Macquarie. In 1813 [[surveying|Deputy Surveyor of Lands]] and explorer, George Evans wrote in his journal:<ref name=\"Scott1\"/>\n<blockquote>30 November 1813: I have at length reached the Ridge I so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles, where I had a prospect to the North for a great distance; A Mist arises from a part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off; and on 9 December 1813: I have called the Main Stream \"Macquarie River\".</blockquote>\n\nTwo years later Governor Macquarie inspected the country surrounding Bathurst and the Macquarie River and wrote on 10 June 1815, on his return to Government House in Sydney:<ref name=\"Scott2\">{{cite book |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-03.html |editor=Scott, Ernest |author=Macquarie, Lachlan |authorlink=Lachlan Macquarie |chapter=III.

The Macquarie River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River, takes a winding course through the plains, which can be easily traced from the high lands adjoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its bank, which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clear surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude, which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by nature for the occupancy and comfort of man, create a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described. </blockquote>\n\nDuring 1817 and 1818, explorer [[John Oxley]] was commissioned to explore the course of the [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] and Macquarie rivers respectively. Writing in his journal, published in 1820, Oxley described the junction of the two rivers:<ref name=\"Scott3\">{{cite book |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-06.html |editor=Scott, Ernest |author=Oxley, John |authorlink=John Oxley |chapter=VI. Oxley's Exploration of the Macquarie |volume=Book 2. Discovery by land |title=Australian Discovery |accessdate=27 March 2012 |publication-date=2002 | publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia |format=Electronic book}}</ref>\n<blockquote>The river in Wellington Valley had been swelled by the late rains, insomuch that the water below its junction with the Macquarie was quite discoloured. From the fineness of the soil, the rain had made the ground very soft, rendering it difficult for the horses to travel.....  Our day's journey lay generally over an open forest country, with rich flats on either side of the river .... The river had many fine reaches, extending in straight lines from one to three miles, and of a corresponding breadth. The rapids, although frequent, offered no material obstruction to the boats. The current in the long reaches was scarcely perceptible .... The river expanded into beautiful reaches, having great depth of water, and from two to three hundred feet broad, literally covered with water-fowl of different kinds: the richest flats bordered the river, apparently more extensive on the south side. The vast body of water which this river must contain in times of flood is confined within exterior banks, and its inundations are thus deprived of mischief..... The trees were of the eucalyptus (apple tree), and on the hills a few of the ''callitris macrocarpa'' [Note: ''Callitr. Vent decad.''] were seen.... The main bed of the river was much contracted, but very deep, the waters spreading to the depth of a foot or eighteen inches over the banks, but all running on the same point of bearing. After going about twenty miles, we lost the land and trees: the channel of the river, which lay through reeds, and was from one to three feet deep, ran northerly. This continued for three or four miles farther, when although there had been no previous change in the breadth, depth, and rapidity of the stream for several miles, and I was sanguine in my expectations of soon entering the long sought for Australian sea, it all at once eluded our farther pursuit by spreading on every point from north-west to north-east, among the ocean of reeds which surrounded us, still running with the same rapidity as before. There, was no channel whatever among those reeds, and the depth varied from three to five feet. This astonishing change (for I cannot call it a termination of the river), of course left me no alternative but to endeavour to return to some spot, on which we could effect a landing before dark.... To assert positively that we were on the margin of the lake or sea into which this great body of water is discharged, might reasonably be deemed a conclusion which has nothing but conjecture for its basis; but if an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances, mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity of an inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually filling up by immense depositions from the higher lands, left by the waters which flow into it. It is most singular, that the high-lands on this continent seem to be confined to the sea-coast, or not to extend to any great distance from it.</blockquote>\n\nBy 1828, explorer [[Charles Sturt]] was commissioned to ascertain \"the limits of the Colony\" by following the Macquarie River \"for the express purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of that basin into which the Macquarie was supposed to fall, and whether any connection existed between it and the streams falling westerly\".<ref name=\"Scott4\">{{cite book |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-11.html |editor=Scott, Ernest |author=Sturt, Charles |authorlink=Charles Sturt |chapter=XI.

This includes an extensive floodplain around Bathurst\n*past [[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]] Plateau, where it is joined from the east by the Turon River, the river drains a plateau extending from near [[Portland, New South Wales|Portland]] to [[Sofala, New South Wales|Sofala]]. The elevation is around {{convert|1100|m}} in the south and {{convert|700|m}} in the north. This area is predominantly rugged slopes.\n*Burrendong Dam, the Macquarie River is joined from the east by the Cudgegong River, which rises in the hills around [[Rylstone, New South Wales|Rylstone]] with a general elevation around {{convert|700|m}}\n*through Wellington and Dubbo where the river is joined by the Bell and Little Rivers. The Bell River rises in flat to undulating country of the [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] plateau, which has a general elevation of {{convert|900|m}} with the highest point being the extinct volcanic peak of [[Mount Canobolas]] at roughly {{convert|1400|m}}. Between Wellington and Dubbo extensive flat areas are evident.\n*north of Dubbo, the Talbragar River joins the Macquarie. The Talbragar is the most important downstream tributary. This river rises in mountainous country at the junction of the Great Dividing Range and the [[Liverpool Range]]. The country through which the Talbragar River runs is broad and flat, bordered by undulating hills that disperse as the river nears Dubbo.\n*north of Dubbo, the river passes through flat plains flowing north-west through Narromine and Warren. A complex series of effluent creeks connect the Macquarie, Darling and Bogan Rivers.\n*Macquarie Marshes lie at the end of the river channel proper. Near [[Carinda, New South Wales|Carinda]], the Macquarie is joined by Marthaguy Creek which drains an area {{convert|6500|km2}} and carries spill-over water from the Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers during floods.\n\n===Rainfall===\nRainfall varies across the catchment of the Macquarie River. Generally the peaks and tablelands receive higher rainfall due to the shadowing effects of the surrounding ranges. The Great Dividing Range area receives between {{convert|750|mm}} and {{convert|900|mm}} annual median rainfall. This is distributed relatively uniformly throughout the year. Where breaks in the Dividing Range allow the intrusion of moist easterly air streams inland, annual median rainfall of {{convert|750|mm}} or more is experienced further westward. Further north-west in the Castlereagh and middle portions of the Macquarie valleys the annual median rainfall is {{convert|300|mm}} to {{convert|400|mm}}.<ref name=\"anra\" />\n\nRainfall can vary dramatically over several years.

In 1813 [[surveying|Deputy Surveyor of Lands]] and explorer, George Evans wrote in his journal:<ref name=\"Scott1\"/>\n<blockquote>30 November 1813: I have at length reached the Ridge I so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles, where I had a prospect to the North for a great distance; A Mist arises from a part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off; and on 9 December 1813: I have called the Main Stream \"Macquarie River\".</blockquote>\n\nTwo years later Governor Macquarie inspected the country surrounding Bathurst and the Macquarie River and wrote on 10 June 1815, on his return to Government House in Sydney:<ref name=\"Scott2\">{{cite book |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-03.html |editor=Scott, Ernest |author=Macquarie, Lachlan |authorlink=Lachlan Macquarie |chapter=III.

The Macquarie River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River, takes a winding course through the plains, which can be easily traced from the high lands adjoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its bank, which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clear surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude, which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by nature for the occupancy and comfort of man, create a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described. </blockquote>\n\nDuring 1817 and 1818, explorer [[John Oxley]] was commissioned to explore the course of the [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] and Macquarie rivers respectively. Writing in his journal, published in 1820, Oxley described the junction of the two rivers:<ref name=\"Scott3\">{{cite book |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-06.html |editor=Scott, Ernest |author=Oxley, John |authorlink=John Oxley |chapter=VI. Oxley's Exploration of the Macquarie |volume=Book 2. Discovery by land |title=Australian Discovery |accessdate=27 March 2012 |publication-date=2002 | publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia |format=Electronic book}}</ref>\n<blockquote>The river in Wellington Valley had been swelled by the late rains, insomuch that the water below its junction with the Macquarie was quite discoloured. From the fineness of the soil, the rain had made the ground very soft, rendering it difficult for the horses to travel.....  Our day's journey lay generally over an open forest country, with rich flats on either side of the river .... The river had many fine reaches, extending in straight lines from one to three miles, and of a corresponding breadth. The rapids, although frequent, offered no material obstruction to the boats. The current in the long reaches was scarcely perceptible .... The river expanded into beautiful reaches, having great depth of water, and from two to three hundred feet broad, literally covered with water-fowl of different kinds: the richest flats bordered the river, apparently more extensive on the south side. The vast body of water which this river must contain in times of flood is confined within exterior banks, and its inundations are thus deprived of mischief..... The trees were of the eucalyptus (apple tree), and on the hills a few of the ''callitris macrocarpa'' [Note: ''Callitr. Vent decad.''] were seen.... The main bed of the river was much contracted, but very deep, the waters spreading to the depth of a foot or eighteen inches over the banks, but all running on the same point of bearing. After going about twenty miles, we lost the land and trees: the channel of the river, which lay through reeds, and was from one to three feet deep, ran northerly. This continued for three or four miles farther, when although there had been no previous change in the breadth, depth, and rapidity of the stream for several miles, and I was sanguine in my expectations of soon entering the long sought for Australian sea, it all at once eluded our farther pursuit by spreading on every point from north-west to north-east, among the ocean of reeds which surrounded us, still running with the same rapidity as before. There, was no channel whatever among those reeds, and the depth varied from three to five feet. This astonishing change (for I cannot call it a termination of the river), of course left me no alternative but to endeavour to return to some spot, on which we could effect a landing before dark.... To assert positively that we were on the margin of the lake or sea into which this great body of water is discharged, might reasonably be deemed a conclusion which has nothing but conjecture for its basis; but if an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances, mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity of an inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually filling up by immense depositions from the higher lands, left by the waters which flow into it. It is most singular, that the high-lands on this continent seem to be confined to the sea-coast, or not to extend to any great distance from it.</blockquote>\n\nBy 1828, explorer [[Charles Sturt]] was commissioned to ascertain \"the limits of the Colony\" by following the Macquarie River \"for the express purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of that basin into which the Macquarie was supposed to fall, and whether any connection existed between it and the streams falling westerly\".<ref name=\"Scott4\">{{cite book |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ausdisc/ausdisc2-11.html |editor=Scott, Ernest |author=Sturt, Charles |authorlink=Charles Sturt |chapter=XI.

Oxley camped near Warren in 1818 and is further commemorated in the naming of Oxley Park on the other side of the river. Sturt passed by just to the north-east in 1828 and the bridge over the river is named after him. Hundreds of galahs roost in the red gums at sunset. The adjacent Red River Gum Walk follows the riverbank around to a 500-year-old river gum adjacent the Warren Hole, a natural and permanent waterhole once used for swimming and fishing.<ref name=SMHWarren>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/new-south-wales/warren/2005/02/17/1108500200060.html |title=Warren |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 February 2004 |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/ieo/MacquarieBogan/maplg.htm|title=Macquarie-Bogan River catchment|format=map|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=}}\n* [http://waterinfo.nsw.gov.au/drr/macquarie.shtml Daily river reports]{{spaced ndash}}NSW Government\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=\"An anonymous widow\" |url=http://bathurstfhg.asn.au/Bathurst1830s.pdf |title=Bathurst in the 1830s |publisher=The Bathurst Times |location=Bathurst, Australia |year=1902 |format=PDF}}\n\n{{Rivers of the Darling River catchment |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Rivers of New South Wales |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Rivers of the Murray\u2013Darling basin|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Rivers of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Tributaries of the Darling River]]\n[[Category:Murray-Darling basin]]\n[[Category:Newell Highway]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "expand rivers to infobox", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_River"}
