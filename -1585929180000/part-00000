The former includes the '''whale catcher''' \u2013 a steam or diesel-driven vessel with a [[harpoon]] gun mounted at its bow. The latter includes such vessels as the sail or steam-driven '''whaleship''' of the 16th to early 20th centuries and the floating factory or [[factory ship]] of the modern era. There have also been vessels which combined the two activities, such as the bottlenose whalers of the late 19th and early 20th century, and catcher/factory ships of the modern era.\n\nWhaleships had two or more [[whaleboat]]s, open rowing boats used in the capture of whales. Whaleboats brought the captured whales to the whaleships to be flensed or cut up. Here the [[blubber]] was rendered into oil using two or three [[try-pot]]s set in a brick furnace called the [[trywork]]s.\n\nAt first, whale catchers either brought the whales they killed to a whaling station, or factory ship anchored in a sheltered bay or inlet. With the later development of the [[slipway]] at the ship's [[stern]], whale catchers were able to transfer their catch to factory ships operating in the open sea.\n\nThe [[World War II]] {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette|1}}s were based on the design of the whale catcher ''[[Southern Pride]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?141835 |title=''Southern Pride HMS'' (K 249)|website= wrecksite.eu}}</ref>\n\n==In wartime==\nThe crews of whaling vessels fought small skirmishes for the control of the [[Spitsbergen]] whale fishery between 1613 and 1638.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century, the owners of whalers frequently armed their vessels with cannons to enable the vessels to protect themselves against pirates, and in wartime, [[privateer]]s. Weapons were also carried on vessels visiting Pacific islands for food, water, and wood in order to defend themselves from the sometimes hostile natives. At the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793, British privateers captured several French whalers, among them ''Necker'' and ''Deux Amis'',{{sfnp|Demerliac|1996|p=201, \u21162019 & \u21162020}} and ''Anne''.{{sfnp|Demerliac|2006|p=203, #2032}} Dutch privateers captured ''Port de Paix'' and ''Penn''.{{sfnp|Demerliac |1996|pp=203-204, \u21162038 & \u21162044}} At the time, many French whalers transferred to the American flag,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} the United States being neutral in the Anglo-French war.\n\nSome whaleships also carried [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] that authorized them to take enemy vessels should the opportunity arise. In July 1793 the British armed whaleship ''Liverpool'', of 20 guns, captured the French whaleship ''Chardon''.

Of those, the ''[[Nisshin Maru]]'' of Japan's [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] (ICR) is the only whaling [[factory ship]] in operation.\n\nAs compared to whaling before and during the 19th century, which was executed with handheld harpoons thrown from oar-powered [[whaleboats]] (depicted most famously in Herman Melville's ''[[Moby Dick]])'', whaling since the 1900s is quite different. [[Whale oil]], which fossil-fuel based alternatives has supplanted, is no longer the primary commercial product of whaling. Whaling is now done for whale meat for the relatively small culinary market. (Norwegian whalers account for about 20% of whales caught and Japanese whalers for about 60%.) [[Harpoon cannon]]s, fired from harpoon ships with displacement in the hundreds of tons, are now universally used for commercial whaling operations. These motorized ships are able to keep up with the sleeker and fast-swimming [[rorquals]] such as the [[fin whale]], that would have been impossible for the muscle-powered rowboats to chase, and allow whaling to be done more safely for the crews.\n\nThe use of grenade-tipped harpoons has greatly improved the effectiveness of whaling, allowing whales to be killed often instantaneously as compared to the previous method in which whales bled to death, which took a long time and left the whale to thrash around in its death throes. These harpoons inject air into the carcass to keep the heavier rorqual whales hunted today from sinking. However, the harpoon-cannon is still criticized for its cruelty as not all whales are killed instantly; death can take from minutes to an hour.\n\nJapan is currently the only country that engages in [[Whaling in Japan|whaling]] in the Antarctic, which is now under the protection of the [[International Whaling Commission]] as the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]]. The area formerly saw large scale commercial whaling operations by numerous countries before the moratorium. The three Japanese harpoon ships of the ICR serve a factory ship that processes the catch on board and preserves it on site in refrigerators, allowing the long endurance whaling missions. These whaling operations, which are claimed by Japan to be for research purposes, sell the meat from these operations on the market, allowed under the current moratorium to defer research costs. They are highly controversial, and are challenged by anti-whaling parties as being merely a disguise for commercial whaling. The [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] has clashed with the Japanese whalers in the Antarctic in confrontations that have led to international media attention and diplomatic incidents.\n\n==Specific ships==\n* ''[[Hvalur 9 RE399]]''\n* [[Jason (ship)|''Jason'' (ship)]]\n* ''[[Southern Actor]]''\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of whaling]]\n*''[[Moby-Dick]]''\n* [[Whaleboat]]\n* [[Whaling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Demerliac |first=Alain |year=1996 |title=La Marine De Louis XVI: Nomenclature Des Navires Fran\u00e7ais De 1774 \u00c0 1792 |location=Nice, France |publisher=\u00c9ditions OMEGA |language=French |isbn=2-906381-23-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Ian|title=Whale Factory Ships and Modern Whaling 1881\u20132016|date=2016|publisher=Ships in Focus|location=Preston, Lancs|isbn=9780992826390}}\n{{refend}}\n==External links==\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/2927  John Read Logbook and Magazine on the Whaler \"Swan\"] at Dartmouth College Library\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1132 Charles Beetle Correspondence and Clippings on ''Whaleships in Port and at Sea''] at Dartmouth College Library\n{{fishing vessel topics}}\n\n[[Category:Whaling ships| ]]\n[[Category:Ship types]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Steamwhaler.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A steam-powered whale catcher with harpoon cannon from Sept-\u00celes ([[Quebec]]), about 1900.]]\n[[File:Charles W Morgan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|{{ship||Charles W.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. While she is there, \u00c1ngel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. The police arrest her at the hospital moments after she tells \u00c1ngel that she knows where the Professor's hideout is, but will not tell them because she \"does not know who the good guys are\". \u00c1ngel is asked by Colonel Prieto where the Professor's hideout is, but he withholds the information. When Colonel Prieto threatens Raquel with several charges that would ensure her daughter taken away from her, she finally gives him the address of the hideout. The police race to the hideout. With the police inside the Mint, Berlin fights them off so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, although the Professor urges him to come. Berlin insistently continues and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape successfully from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police show up. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force, the robbers got away with about \u20ac1 billion and their whereabouts are still unknown.

Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels sink in mud.

After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working.

Raquel is discovered in the barn by a farmer and his wife, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]] and a negotiation between Raquel and the farmers. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Afterwards, Sierra plans to use Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Su\u00e1rez and his men close in on Raquel's position as Raquel bargains with the farmers for her freedom by offering a reward greater than that of the police.

She rides a motorcycle directly into the Mint, avoiding being shot by police as Moscow opens the door.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = A contrarreloj\n| AltTitle        = Against the Clock\n| DirectedBy      = Alejandro Bazzano\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Esther Mart\u00ednez Lobato, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancrist\u00f3bal & David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|16|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 1.48<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n| ShortSummary    = Moscow is gravely injured by a police gunshot after helping Tokyo return to the Mint and the police refuse to send aid. The robbers then rush to finish their escape tunnel. The Professor walks out of the villa at gunpoint by Raquel, but she is emotionally unable and unwilling to stop him from escaping. Colonel Prieto, Su\u00e1rez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made from local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel. With her gun and badge taken away, she takes \u00c1ngel's [[badge]] and starts to conduct her own investigation by looking through surveillance footage of restaurants to determine the route the Professor had taken from his hideout.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. While she is there, \u00c1ngel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. The police arrest her at the hospital moments after she tells \u00c1ngel that she knows where the Professor's hideout is, but will not tell them because she \"does not know who the good guys are\". \u00c1ngel is asked by Colonel Prieto where the Professor's hideout is, but he withholds the information. When Colonel Prieto threatens Raquel with several charges that would ensure her daughter taken away from her, she finally gives him the address of the hideout. The police race to the hideout. With the police inside the Mint, Berlin fights them off so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, although the Professor urges him to come. Berlin insistently continues and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape successfully from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police show up. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force, the robbers got away with about \u20ac1 billion and their whereabouts are still unknown. Raquel looks at some postcards given to her previously by the Professor, which she notices has coordinates on them, and when pieced together give a location in [[Palawan]], Philippines. She travels there and finds the Professor and smiles.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=15 |director=12 |writer=38 |airdate=25 |airdateR=<ref name=\"TFC\">{{cite web |title=Money Heist \u2013 Listings |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/la-casa-de-papel/listings/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> |aux1T=English title |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|p=3|c=#000000}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Hemos vuelto\n| AltTitle        = We're Back\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Over two years after the heist, Arturo gives a talk to a large crowd condemning the fugitive members of the gang who held him and others hostage at the Mint as \"terrorists\". Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio. The professor enlists three new members, B\u00f3gota, Palermo and Marseille, into the gang and begins planning an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Aikido\n| AltTitle        = Aikido\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya, Alberto \u00dacar, David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Professor initiates the plan to rob the Bank of Spain using [[airships]] to release money across Madrid. The government responds by mobilizing the army, which the robbers use to provide cover and entry into the Bank. In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage. As the robbers enter the Bank, public sentiment rallies to their side in the form of mass government protests and riots over the illegal imprisonment of Rio, demanding that he receive a public trial.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = 48 metros bajo el suelo\n| AltTitle        = 48 Meters Underground\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = While commandeering the Bank, the robbers engage in a series of intense conflicts with guards and government officials.

B\u00f3gota, uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold.

Colonel Tamayo and Alicia Sierra prove to be formidable adversaries, as they quickly realize that they must change their strategies drastically from the first robbery. Sierra tortures Rio for more information and Tamayo plans a full assault on the Mint with Su\u00e1rez. The robbers reveal that they know about a second, secret vault behind the gold and attempt to persuade the governor of the bank to open it for them.

It works and grants them access to \"the red boxes\"\u2014cases filled with government secrets that were too dangerous to lock anywhere else. Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise. To stall for time and prevent bloodshed, Denver runs into the line of fire with a truce flag carrying two of the red cases, which forces Tamayo to stop. He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable, she takes shelter in a barn.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = La deriva\n| AltTitle        = Astray\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, \u00c1lex Pina, Almudena Ram\u00edrez-Pantanella, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo drinks herself into a semi-[[stupor]] as a result of her breakup and insults Rio as a coping mechanism for her emotional pain. In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by a farmer and his wife, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]] and a negotiation between Raquel and the farmers. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Afterwards, Sierra plans to use Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Su\u00e1rez and his men close in on Raquel's position as Raquel bargains with the farmers for her freedom by offering a reward greater than that of the police. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot; Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[Exsanguination|exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, he becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2, meaning war. Tokyo and Rio rush into firing position with [[RPG-7]]s and fire on the approaching armoured car, destroying it. It is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=4|c=#2C6576}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Game Over\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Berlin's Wedding\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Anatomy Lesson\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 27\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Pasodoble\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = TKO\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 30\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = Strike the Tent\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = The Paris Plan\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Arsahm88", "label": "safe", "comment": "A clue about Money Heist Season 5", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the current Bengali calendar owes its origin in Bengal to the rule of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] who adopted it to time the tax year to the harvest. The Bangla year was therewith called ''Bangabda''. Akbar asked the royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the Bengali calendar.<ref name= Chakrabarti114>{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114\u2013115}}</ref><ref name=banglapedia>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}</ref> According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]], a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of ''Punyaho'' as \"a day for ceremonial land tax collection\", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.<ref name=meghna>{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17\u201318}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4739604/google-doodle-pohela-boishakh-bangladesh/|title=Google Doodle Celebrates Pohela Boishakh in Bangladesh|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIt is unclear whether it was adopted by Hussain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Hussain Shah before Akbar.<ref name=\"Sengupta2011\"/> According to [[Amartya Sen]], Akbar's official calendar \"Tarikh-ilahi\" with the zero year of 1556 was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars. It was not used much in India outside of Akbar's Mughal court, and after his death the calendar he launched was abandoned.

In the \"Tarikh-e-Elahi\" version of the calendar, each day of the month had a separate name, and the months had different names from what they have now.

After the change Dec 16 will fall on Poush 1, not on the second day of the month.\n\nBengali New Year will also fall on Apr 14, Rabindra Joyanti of Baishakh 25 on May 8 and Nazrul Joyanti of Jaishthha 11 on May 25.\n\nThe Bengali calendar had been revised twice earlier. Astrophysicist Dr Meghnad Saha led the first revision in the 1950s and Dr Muhammad Shahidullah in 1963.\n\n===Days===\nThe Bengali Calendar incorporates the seven-day [[week]] as used by many other calendars. The names of the days of the week in the Bengali Calendar are based on the [[Navagraha]] ({{lang-bn|\u09a8\u09ac\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09b9}} ''n\u00f4b\u00f4gr\u00f4h\u00f4''). The day begins and ends at sunrise in the Bengali calendar, unlike in the Gregorian calendar, where the day starts at midnight.\n\nAccording to some scholars, in the calendar originally introduced by [[Akbar]] in the year 1584 [[AD]], each day of the month had a different name, but this was cumbersome, and his grandson [[Shah Jahan]] changed this to a 7-day week as in the [[Gregorian calendar]], with the week also starting on a Sunday.<ref name=Banglapedia/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%;\"\n|-\n!

The Secret Service also provides physical security for the [[White House|White House Complex]], the neighboring [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] building, the [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]], and all foreign diplomatic missions in [[Washington, D.C.]] The protective mission includes protective operations to coordinate manpower and logistics with state and local [[law enforcement]], protective advances to conduct site and venue assessments for protectees, and protective intelligence to investigate all manners of threats made against protectees. The Secret Service is the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for events designated as [[National Special Security Event|National Special Security Events (NSSE)]]. As part of the Service's mission of preventing an incident before it occurs, the agency relies on meticulous advance work and threat assessments developed by its [[Intelligence Division]] to identify potential risks to protectees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/|title=United States Secret Service: Protective Mission|publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=September 20, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Investigative mission===\nSafeguards the payment and [[financial systems]] of the [[United States]] from a wide range of financial and electronic-based crimes. Financial investigations include [[counterfeit]] US currency, bank and financial institution fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, illicit financing operations, and major conspiracies. Electronic investigations include [[cybercrime]], network intrusions, identity theft, access device fraud, credit card fraud, and intellectual property crimes. The Secret Service is also a member of the [[FBI]]'s [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF) which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale. Also, the Secret Service investigates missing and exploited children and is a partner of the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] (NCMEC).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/investigation/|title=United States Secret Service: Investigative Mission |publisher=Secretservice.gov|accessdate=September 20, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe Secret Service's initial responsibility was to investigate the [[counterfeiting]] of US currency, which was rampant following the [[American Civil War]]. The agency then evolved into the [[United States]]' first domestic intelligence and [[counterintelligence]] agency. Many of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), and [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division]] (IRS-CI).\n\n==Dual objective==\n[[File:Secret Service agents conducting investigations.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents conducting electronic investigations]]\n[[File:US Secret Service Agent.jpg|thumb|right|Secret Service agents protecting [[President George W. Bush]] in 2002]]\nThe Secret Service combines the two responsibilities into a unique dual objective. The two core missions of protection and investigations synergize with the other, providing crucial benefits to special agents during the course of their careers. Skills developed during the course of investigations which are also used in an agent\u2019s protective duties include but are not limited to: \n* Partnerships that are created between field offices and local law enforcement during the course of investigations being used to gather both protective intelligence and in coordinating protection events.\n* [[Tactical operation]] (e.g. surveillance, arrests, and search warrants) and law enforcement writing (e.g. affidavits, after action reports, and operations plans) skills being applied to both investigative and protective duties.\n* Proficiency in analyzing handwriting and forgery techniques being applied in protective investigations of handwritten letters and suspicious package threats.\n* Expertise in investigating electronic and financial crimes being applied in protective investigations of threats made against the nation's leaders on the [[Internet]].\n\nProtection of the nation's highest elected leaders and other government officials is one of the primary missions of the Secret Service. After the 1901 [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of President William McKinley]], [[Congress]] also directed the Secret Service to protect the [[president of the United States]].\n\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:<ref name=\"ProtectionLaw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3056-|title=United States Code: Title 18, Section 3056}}</ref>\n* The president, [[vice president]] (or other officer next in the order of succession to the [[Office of President]], should the vice presidency be vacant), president-elect and [[vice president]]\u2013-elect\n* The immediate families of the above individuals\n* Former presidents and their spouses for their lifetimes (except when the spouse divorces or remarries), under the [[Former Presidents Act]].

The agency's key focus is on large, high-dollar economic impact cases involving organized criminal groups. Financial criminals include embezzling bank employees, armed robbers at automatic teller machines, heroin traffickers, and criminal organizations that commit bank fraud on a global scale.\n\nThe USSS plays a leading role in facilitating relationships between other law enforcement entities, the private sector, and academia. The Service maintains the Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating international cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other computer-related crimes. Additionally, the Secret Service runs the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI), which provides law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges with cyber training and information to combat cybercrime.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Logo of the United States Secret Service.svg|180px|left|thumb| Logo of the United States Secret Service]]\nWith a reported one third of the currency in circulation being counterfeit at the time,<ref name=\"clinton2.nara.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html|title=The United States Secret Service|publisher=Clinton2.nara.gov|date=July 1, 1922|accessdate=August 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802032332/http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html|archive-date=August 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in [[Washington, D.C.]], to suppress [[counterfeit]] currency.

Rowley Training Center (RTC).jpg|thumb|Secret Service agent trainees at the James J.

The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC) in [[Glynco, Georgia]], lasting approximately 12 weeks. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the Secret Service Academy, [[James J. Rowley Training Center]] (JJRTC), just outside [[Washington, D.C.]] in [[Laurel, Maryland]], lasting approximately 18 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secretservice.gov/join/training|title=Agent Training}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.jpg|thumb|left|Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.]]\nA typical special agent career path, depending upon performance and promotions that affect individual assignments, begins with the first six to eight years on the job assigned to a field office. Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.<ref name=\"USSS\"/>\n\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13 (GS-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade level for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach in as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as senior field agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step-10.\n\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/availability-pay|title=LEAP Pay}}</ref> Therefore, an agent living in the Greater New York City area will earn an annual salary of approximately $78,961 (GL-09), $92,452 (GS-11), $110,813 (GS-12), $131,771 (GS-13), $155,713 (GS-14), and $170,800 (GS-15).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2018/law-enforcement-officer-salary-calculator|title=LEAP Salary Calculator}}</ref>\n\nMoreover due to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law enforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (in addition to LEAP), and enjoy a raised statutory pay cap of $197,300 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule) as opposed to $170,800 per year (Level IV of the Executive Schedule).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/837/1 |title=Secret Service Agent Overtime Pay}}</ref>\n\n===Uniformed Division Officer===\n{{Main|United States Secret Service Uniformed Division}}\n[[File:Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT).png|thumb|Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT)]]\n\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a [[security police]] similar to the [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] or [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|DHS Federal Protective Service]] and is in charge of protecting the physical [[White House]] grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Established in 1922 as the [[White House Police Force|White House Police]], this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\n\nSecret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the vice president's residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions.<ref name=\"Uniformed\"/> Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:\n* Canine Unit: Performing security sweeps and responding to bomb threats and suspicious packages.\n* Emergency Response Team: Providing a coordinated tactical response for the White House and other protected facilities.\n* Counter-sniper Team: Utilizing observation, sighting equipment and high-performance weapons to provide a secure environment for protectees.\n* Motorcade Support Unit: Providing motorcycle tactical support for official movements of motorcades.\n* Crime Scene Search Unit: Photographing, collecting and processing physical and latent evidence.\n* Office of Training: Serving as firearms and classroom instructors or recruiters.\n* Special Operations Section: Handling special duties and functions at the White House Complex, including conducting the daily congressional and public tours of the White House.<ref name=\"Uniformed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/join/careers/uniformed|title=Uniformed Division Careers}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Special Officer===\nSecret Service special officers (not to be confused with Uniformed Division Officers) are federal agents who work within the Special Agent Division and perform a wide range of security functions and support assignments as part of the protective mission for the Secret Service. Whereas special agents alternate between protection and investigative assignments, special officers are hired only to work protection details. They must have a familiarity with all phases of protective responsibilities sufficient to assist in protective movements, cover designated security posts and drive protective vehicles.\n\nAssignments may include:\n* Maintaining designated protective security posts that control movement of persons into and around multiple Secret Service facilities and associated areas\n* Inspecting all operational, safety, emergency, and convenience equipment of protective vehicles to ensure peak-operating condition\n* Driving protective or follow-up vehicles\n* Monitoring and operating various communications equipment\n* Using various advanced x-ray screening technologies to detect and identify high-risk items\nSpecial officers are sworn law enforcement officers, and are authorized to make arrests in connection with their official duties. They are classified as federal agents but use \"special officer\" as their official title much the same way as Deputy US Marshals are special agents but use the title \"Deputy US Marshal\".\n\nNewly appointed special officers must successfully complete nine (9) weeks of intensive training at the Special Officer Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.\n\n===Investigative Protection Officer===\nInvestigative Protection Officer \"IPO\" is a new title reclassification of the Special Officer position. IPOs have full law enforcement authority and are charged with supporting investigations and supporting the USSS protective mission. Their full performance level is GS-12 instead of GL-9,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} which is a Special Officer. Newly appointed IPO\u2019s must successfully complete Six (6) Months of intensive training at the IPO Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. and The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Weapons and equipment==\n[[File:Snipers Perched.jpg|alt=Two men on a roof with rifles positioned on tripods|thumb|Secret Service snipers protect Vice President [[Mike Pence]] in [[Indianapolis]] in 2017.]]\nSince the agency's inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.\n\n===Previously-issued firearms===\nInitially sidearms were privately procured and there was little, if any, standardization. In the 1930s, agents often carried [[Colt M1911A1]] pistols in [[.45 ACP]] caliber. In addition to the 1911A1, from the 1930s through the 1960s, Special Agents often carried the [[Colt Detective Special]] and - upon its release in 1950 - the [[Smith & Wesson Model 36]] .38-Special revolvers.\n\nFollowing the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, along with the growing trend of [[.357 Magnum]] revolvers being issued to law enforcement, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum [[Smith & Wesson Model 19]] revolver; often the 2.5-inch barreled model for ease of concealment. Between 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service also issued the Smith & Wesson Model 66 revolver, a stainless variant of the Model 19 with anywhere from the 2.5-inch to 4-inch-barrel and loaded with [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]]. In 1992, as law enforcement nationwide phased out revolvers in favor of higher-capacity [[semi-automatic pistol]]s, the standard-issue handgun became the [[SIG Sauer P226#P228|SIG Sauer P228]] 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service from 1992 to 1999.\n\nThe Secret Service replaced the [[Thompson submachine gun]] often used by federal law enforcement in  the [[Prohibition Era]] with the [[Colt AR-15]] rifle for long-range protection, along with the [[Uzi]] submachine gun for more concealable firepower in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively. Uzis used by the Secret Service had slightly shorter-than-standard barrels so they could to fit inside the standard size [[Samsonite]] briefcases that concealed them. This setup was famously deployed by Special Agent Robert Wanko during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. The agency, like many others, phased out the Uzi in the 1990s and replaced it with the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|H&K MP5]] submachine gun. The Secret Service was the last Federal agency to use the Uzi. The [[Secret Service Counter Assault Team|Counter Assault Team]] used the [[M4 carbine]] from the early 1990s until 2006.\n\n===Current weapons===\nAgents and officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the [[FN P90]] submachine gun, the 9mm [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] submachine gun, and the 12-gauge [[Remington 870]] [[shotgun]].<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically, Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://qz.com/1478513/new-us-secret-service-lapel-pins-will-come-with-a-secret-security-feature/|title=New US Secret Service lapel pins will come with a secret security feature|publisher=Quartz.com|date=November 30, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the counter-sniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers.

Rowley Training Center (RTC)]]\n\nSpecial agents receive training in two locations, totaling approximately 7 months. The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC) in [[Glynco, Georgia]], lasting approximately 12 weeks. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the Secret Service Academy, [[James J. Rowley Training Center]] (JJRTC), just outside [[Washington, D.C.]] in [[Laurel, Maryland]], lasting approximately 18 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secretservice.gov/join/training|title=Agent Training}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.jpg|thumb|left|Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.]]\nA typical special agent career path, depending upon performance and promotions that affect individual assignments, begins with the first six to eight years on the job assigned to a field office. Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.<ref name=\"USSS\"/>\n\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education.<ref name=\"USSS\"/> Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13 (GS-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade level for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach in as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as senior field agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step-10.\n\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/availability-pay|title=LEAP Pay}}</ref> Therefore, an agent living in the Greater New York City area will earn an annual salary of approximately $78,961 (GL-09), $92,452 (GS-11), $110,813 (GS-12), $131,771 (GS-13), $155,713 (GS-14), and $170,800 (GS-15).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2018/law-enforcement-officer-salary-calculator|title=LEAP Salary Calculator}}</ref>\n\nMoreover due to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law enforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (in addition to LEAP), and enjoy a raised statutory pay cap of $197,300 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule) as opposed to $170,800 per year (Level IV of the Executive Schedule).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/837/1 |title=Secret Service Agent Overtime Pay}}</ref>\n\n===Uniformed Division Officer===\n{{Main|United States Secret Service Uniformed Division}}\n[[File:Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT).png|thumb|Secret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response Team (ERT)]]\n\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a [[security police]] similar to the [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] or [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|DHS Federal Protective Service]] and is in charge of protecting the physical [[White House]] grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Established in 1922 as the [[White House Police Force|White House Police]], this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\n\nSecret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the vice president's residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions.<ref name=\"Uniformed\"/> Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:\n* Canine Unit: Performing security sweeps and responding to bomb threats and suspicious packages.\n* Emergency Response Team: Providing a coordinated tactical response for the White House and other protected facilities.\n* Counter-sniper Team: Utilizing observation, sighting equipment and high-performance weapons to provide a secure environment for protectees.\n* Motorcade Support Unit: Providing motorcycle tactical support for official movements of motorcades.\n* Crime Scene Search Unit: Photographing, collecting and processing physical and latent evidence.\n* Office of Training: Serving as firearms and classroom instructors or recruiters.\n* Special Operations Section: Handling special duties and functions at the White House Complex, including conducting the daily congressional and public tours of the White House.<ref name=\"Uniformed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.secretservice.gov/join/careers/uniformed|title=Uniformed Division Careers}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Special Officer===\nSecret Service special officers (not to be confused with Uniformed Division Officers) are federal agents who work within the Special Agent Division and perform a wide range of security functions and support assignments as part of the protective mission for the Secret Service. Whereas special agents alternate between protection and investigative assignments, special officers are hired only to work protection details. They must have a familiarity with all phases of protective responsibilities sufficient to assist in protective movements, cover designated security posts and drive protective vehicles.\n\nAssignments may include:\n* Maintaining designated protective security posts that control movement of persons into and around multiple Secret Service facilities and associated areas\n* Inspecting all operational, safety, emergency, and convenience equipment of protective vehicles to ensure peak-operating condition\n* Driving protective or follow-up vehicles\n* Monitoring and operating various communications equipment\n* Using various advanced x-ray screening technologies to detect and identify high-risk items\nSpecial officers are sworn law enforcement officers, and are authorized to make arrests in connection with their official duties. They are classified as federal agents but use \"special officer\" as their official title much the same way as Deputy US Marshals are special agents but use the title \"Deputy US Marshal\".\n\nNewly appointed special officers must successfully complete nine (9) weeks of intensive training at the Special Officer Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.\n\n===Investigative Protection Officer===\nInvestigative Protection Officer \"IPO\" is a new title reclassification of the Special Officer position. IPOs have full law enforcement authority and are charged with supporting investigations and supporting the USSS protective mission. Their full performance level is GS-12 instead of GL-9,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} which is a Special Officer. Newly appointed IPO\u2019s must successfully complete Six (6) Months of intensive training at the IPO Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. and The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Weapons and equipment==\n[[File:Snipers Perched.jpg|alt=Two men on a roof with rifles positioned on tripods|thumb|Secret Service snipers protect Vice President [[Mike Pence]] in [[Indianapolis]] in 2017.]]\nSince the agency's inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.\n\n===Previously-issued firearms===\nInitially sidearms were privately procured and there was little, if any, standardization. In the 1930s, agents often carried [[Colt M1911A1]] pistols in [[.45 ACP]] caliber. In addition to the 1911A1, from the 1930s through the 1960s, Special Agents often carried the [[Colt Detective Special]] and - upon its release in 1950 - the [[Smith & Wesson Model 36]] .38-Special revolvers.\n\nFollowing the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, along with the growing trend of [[.357 Magnum]] revolvers being issued to law enforcement, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum [[Smith & Wesson Model 19]] revolver; often the 2.5-inch barreled model for ease of concealment. Between 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service also issued the Smith & Wesson Model 66 revolver, a stainless variant of the Model 19 with anywhere from the 2.5-inch to 4-inch-barrel and loaded with [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]]. In 1992, as law enforcement nationwide phased out revolvers in favor of higher-capacity [[semi-automatic pistol]]s, the standard-issue handgun became the [[SIG Sauer P226#P228|SIG Sauer P228]] 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service from 1992 to 1999.\n\nThe Secret Service replaced the [[Thompson submachine gun]] often used by federal law enforcement in  the [[Prohibition Era]] with the [[Colt AR-15]] rifle for long-range protection, along with the [[Uzi]] submachine gun for more concealable firepower in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively. Uzis used by the Secret Service had slightly shorter-than-standard barrels so they could to fit inside the standard size [[Samsonite]] briefcases that concealed them. This setup was famously deployed by Special Agent Robert Wanko during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. The agency, like many others, phased out the Uzi in the 1990s and replaced it with the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|H&K MP5]] submachine gun. The Secret Service was the last Federal agency to use the Uzi. The [[Secret Service Counter Assault Team|Counter Assault Team]] used the [[M4 carbine]] from the early 1990s until 2006.\n\n===Current weapons===\nAgents and officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the [[FN P90]] submachine gun, the 9mm [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] submachine gun, and the 12-gauge [[Remington 870]] [[shotgun]].<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

CAT also deploys 12 gauge Remington 870 MCS breaching shotguns. Uniform Division technicians assigned to the Counter Sniper (CS) team use custom built [[.300 Winchester Magnum]]-chambered bolt-action rifles referred to as JARs (\"Just Another Rifle\"). These rifles are built with Remington 700 long actions in Accuracy International stocks and use Schmidt & Bender optics.

In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically, Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://qz.com/1478513/new-us-secret-service-lapel-pins-will-come-with-a-secret-security-feature/|title=New US Secret Service lapel pins will come with a secret security feature|publisher=Quartz.com|date=November 30, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the counter-sniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers.
