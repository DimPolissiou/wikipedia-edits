Introduced  in 1968 as a new model positioned above the 1968 [[Nissan Bluebird#510 series|Datsun Bluebird 510]], the Laurel offered the luxury of the [[Nissan Cedric#Second generation 130|Nissan Cedric 130]] in a smaller size. The [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] is a noble tree in Greek mythology, and the [[laurel wreath]] a symbol of honorable status. In Japan, the Laurel was not marketed as a Datsun, being always labeled as a Nissan.\n\nThe first Laurel was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] R&D Division and assembled at the [[Musashimurayama]] Plant of the former [[Prince Motor Company]] in 2-door and 4-door variants. Released as a Nissan after Prince merged with Nissan, Laurels shared many components and architectures with the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] range. The Laurel was not marketed new in Japan at ''Nissan Prince Shop'' locations that sold the Skyline and Gloria, former Prince products. Instead the Laurel was sold at ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Motor Shop]]'' as the junior model to the larger V8-powered [[Nissan President]].\n\nSince 1968, eight generations of Laurel have been produced in [[Japan]]. Nissan intermittently listed the Laurel for sale in various [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an markets (it was also sold in [[Chile]] and [[Panama]], as the Datsun Laurel, starting in the late seventies), and then discontinued the [[export]] of this model from 1989.\n\nThe Laurel was cancelled subsequent to Nissan's  [[Renault\u2013Nissan\u2013Mitsubishi Alliance|alliance with Renault]].\n__TOC__\n{{anchor|C30}}\n\n== First generation (C30) (1968\u20131972) ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan Laurel C30.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C30\n| production   = 1968\u20131972\n| body_style   = {{ubl\n  | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9]]\n  | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n  }}\n\n| layout       = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| platform     = \n|caption=Nissan Laurel\n| aka          = {{ubl\n\n  | Datsun Laurel\n\n  | Datsun 200L\n  | Datsun 1800 <ref>[http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html ''1968 Nissan Laurel C30'', www.earlydatsun.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208131718/http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html |date=2015-02-08 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015</ref>\n  }}\n\n| engine       = {{ubl\n\n  | 1.8 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-18|G-18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n\n  | 2.0 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]]'' I4\n  }}\n\n| transmission = {{ubl\n\n  | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n\n  | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n\n| length       = {{convert|4305|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1605|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1405|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1005|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2620|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = {{ubl\n  | [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Nissan Skyline]]\n  }}\n\n}}\n\nIn April 1968 Nissan presented its new Laurel in four-door deLuxe and Super deLuxe versions, both equipped with a 1.8 L [[inline-four engine]] and independent rear suspension. In June 1970 a two-door hardtop coup\u00e9 joined the lineup, as a junior version of the all-new [[Nissan Cedric#Third generation 230|Nissan Cedric/Gloria coupe]], and one year later a 2000&nbsp;cc engine became available in the four-door sedan as well. Its competitors at introduction were the [[Toyota Mark II#T60|Toyota Corona Mark II]] sedan, and the [[Mazda Luce#SU|Mazda Luce]] which was introduced in 1966. The Laurel did not sell as well as expected, largely because the design was too similar to that of the smaller, cheaper [[Datsun 510|Bluebird (510)]].<ref name=shiTak>{{cite journal | journal = Motor Magazine International | date = January 1974 | title = New Model: Nissan Laurel | page = 8 | ref = MMI7 | volume = 2 | number = 1 | location = Tokyo, Japan }}</ref>\n\nThis car was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] vehicle development team, but the C30 Laurel was fitted with the Prince four-cylinder [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, the [[Prince G engine#G-18|G18]]. (On the other hand, the GC10 [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Skyline]] 2000GT was developed by the former Prince [[Ogikubo, Tokyo|Ogikubo]] vehicle development team, but was fitted with Nissan [[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] SOHC engine.) This was of 1,815&nbsp;cc capacity. The suspension is the same four-wheel independent system that was fitted on the C10 Skyline.\n \nThe Laurel Hardtop model was equipped with the SOHC 1,990&nbsp;cc {{convert|110|or|120|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Prince G engine#G-20|G20]]-series four-cylinders. The four-door sedan was originally only available with the lesser G18. The [[SU Carburettor|SU twin-carburetted]] 2000GX received sporty equipment.\n \nAugust 1970 saw the release of a modified version of the four-door sedan version, now with the same roof angle as that of the hard top. The instrument panel received redesigned panel meters, and the more luxurious GL grade was added.\n[[File:1972 Nissan Laurel Hardtop.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Nissan Laurel series C30 2000GX coupe]]\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n{{anchor|C130}}\n\n== Second generation (C130) (1972\u20131977) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C130\n| image        = File:1974 Nissan Laurel Hadtop 2000SGX.jpg\n| caption      = Nissan Laurel 2000SGX series C130\n| production   = 1972\u20131977\n| body_style   = 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9]]<br> 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| layout       = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n|assembly=[[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| platform     = \n| aka          = Datsun Laurel<br>Datsun 200L\n| engine       = {{ubl\n\n  | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n\n  | 1815&nbsp;c ''[[Prince G engine#G-18|G18]]'' I4\n\n  | 1990&nbsp;c ''[[Prince G engine#G-20|G20]]'' I4\n\n  | 1998&nbsp;c ''[[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20A]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n\n  | 2565&nbsp;c ''[[Nissan L engine#L26|L26]]'' I6\n\n  | 2753&nbsp;c ''[[Nissan L engine#L28|L28]]'' I6\n\n  | [[Induction motor]] (EV)\n\n  }}\n\n| transmission = 4/5-speed manual<br> 3-speed automatic\n| length       = {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1415|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{ubl\n\n  | {{convert|1155|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n  | {{convert|1919|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (EV)\n\n  }}\n\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = [[Nissan Skyline#C110|Nissan Skyline]]\n}}\n \nIn April 1972 the second Laurel generation appeared, again in four-door saloon and two-door hardtop coup\u00e9 form affectionately known as the ''Butaketsu'' Laurel (\"pig's butt\") because of its ample rear quarter panels and tail section, with the taillights incorporated into the rear bumper. The saloon now was endowed with a rear beam axle and leaf springs, while the coup\u00e9 clung to independent rear suspension. In addition to the 1.8 and 2.0 L four-cylinder engines, a 2.0 L inline-six was now available, joined, from October, 1973, by a 2.6 L six; the latter was replaced by a 2.8 L six in late 1975. The [[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]] 4-cylinder and L20 [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engines were equipped with [[SU carburetor|SU]] twin carburetors but were eliminated February 1976 due to emission regulations.\n\nThe styling of the coupe appears to be influenced by the 1970 [[Ford Torino#1970\u20131971: New Torino|Ford Torino]] and the 1971 [[Mercury Cougar#Second generation|Mercury Cougar]], reflecting a popular styling trend during the 1960s and 1970s called \"[[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]]\". Sales in Japan (very few were exported) ran to about 96,000 per year, with three-quarters sedans.<ref name=MMI9>[[#MMI7|Motor Magazine International (January 1974)]], pp. 9-10</ref> The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Mark II#Generation 2 (1972\u20131976) X10/X20 series|Mark II]] coup\u00e9 and sedan.\n\n[[File:Datsun 200L sedan (C130) in Norway B+W.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun 200L sedan (Europe)]]\nEngines available at the time were the four-cylinder 1815&nbsp;cc G18 and 1990&nbsp;cc G20, and the six-cylinder 1998&nbsp;cc L20. Both the G20 and L20 were available with twin SU carburettors as an option. However, only the G20 equipped cars outwardly announced this with a \"Twin Carburettor 2000GX\" badge.\n\nIn October 1973 the first Laurel with the 2565&nbsp;cc L26 six-cylinder engine was added and badged as \"2600SGL\". Since the engine was over two litres, it was not restrained by the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|size limits]] imposed by Japanese regulations, and therefore it was fitted with bigger bumpers than regular Laurels. The installation of the 2.6-litre engine in Japanese models helped identify this generation as a luxury car, as the larger engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay higher amounts of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n\nIn September 1975, in order to meet the new emissions regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753&nbsp;cc L28 six-cylinder. By October the carburettors in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770&nbsp;cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup.\n\nIn February 1976 carburetted 1.8-litre and 2.0-litre engines which met the 1976 emissions regulations were introduced, and were identified with the [[Nissan NAPS]] badge.\n\n[[File:1974 Nissan Laurel Hadtop 2000SGX rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel 2000SGX Hardtop (C130) with non-standard wheels]]\n\n==={{anchor|EV|C130-EV}} Laurel C130-EV===\nIn 1974 Nissan developed an electric passenger sedan based on the Nissan Laurel.

For the first time, the C230 was available in either saloon and hardtop coup\u00e9 form, but also as a hardtop saloon without B-posts. The hardtop was only available with six-cylinder engines. Buyers could choose between a 1.8-litre four, a 2.0-litre inline-six (carburetted or fuel-injected, a first for the Laurel), a 2.8-litre six, or a 2.0-litre [[Diesel engine|diesel]] four, sourced from [[Nissan Diesel]].

November 1982 saw the introduction of the Limited \"Givenchy Version\" with [[Hubert de Givenchy]] doing the TV commercials in Japan, borrowing a marketing concept for an American luxury coupe, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV Designer Editions|Lincoln Continental Mark IV]]. In 1981, the [[Nissan Sunny#B11 (1981\u20131985)|Nissan Laurel Spirit]] was offered as a smaller alternative to the Laurel, while still offering the luxury content of the larger car.\n\n[[File:1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop (C31, Chile)]]\nDevelopment Supervisor, Itirou Makoto Sakurai, was in charge of developing the Laurel together with the Skyline. The Laurel's redesign was carried out in a European style and tone. The coefficient of drag (Cd value) of the four-door hardtop is 0.38. The lowest-priced Z18 is a four-cylinder engine, as is the 2-litre Z20. The L20-series are inline-six cylinder models, also available in fuel injected L20E type, and as the turbocharged L20ET - the first turbocharged Laurel. On top of the lineup was the 2.8-litre L28E, and for some export markets the 2.4-litre L24 engine (usually carburetted) was also offered. Mostly for commercial use there was the four-cylinder LD20 diesel engine, while private users usually preferred the larger six-cylinder LD28 type which was also available with much better equipment.\n\nIn February 1981 the GX trim level was added. L20E sedan with independent rear suspension in the vehicle suspension formula (a six-link independent rear suspension was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981 the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup.\n\nIn September 1982 there was a minor change. Up a sense of luxury and large-scale extrusion in the chrome bumpers and rear license plate holder. The tail lamp design was changed as well. Instead of the Z18 series engine, the new OHC four-cylinder 1809&nbsp;cc CA18S engine was fitted to the Laurel 1.8. The engine range was overhauled at the time and now included the CA18S, L20E, turbocharged L20ET, the four-cylinder SOHC Z20S, and the diesel LD20 and LD28-6 models. The carburetted L20, the L28E, and the column-shifted LD20 (six-seater) were discontinued. The six-cylinder gasoline-powered car with automatic transmission and Super Touring equipment received an overdrive gear at the same time.\n\nIn November 1982 the Givenchy limited version was released. In February 1983 the \"50 Special\" released. In March the Givenchy II version went on sale. In May another 50 Special II vehicles were launched. In July electrically retractable fender and door mirrors were introduced, a first. In October, taxi and driver instruction vehicles with an OHC LPG four-cylinder engine (Z18P, Standard or GL equipment) were added. SGL Grand Touring car (with a hubcap for Medalist colored bumper and large) and 50 Special Release III.\n\nJanuary 1984 saw the abolition of the 1.8-litre GL models, while the Givenchy III limited edition also went on sale.\n\n[[File:1982 Datsun Laurel 2400 (1).jpg|thumb|left|1982 Datsun Laurel 2.4 SGL Sedan (C31, The Netherlands)]]\nEuropean export models received the carburetted 2.0 (DX or SGL trim) and 2.4 inline-sixes (SGL), with {{convert|71|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|88|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} respectively, or with the large 2.8 diesel with {{convert|60|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{citation | type = brochure | title = Nissan Gamma |trans-title=Nissan range | language = nl-be | publisher = N.V.

The [[Nissan L engine#LD28|LD28]] diesel engine were swapped out in favor of the similarly dimensioned [[Nissan RD engine#RD25|RD28]]. This generation became the first Laurel with a [[V6 engine]].\n\nThe C32 was the last model to be sold outside Japan. In Europe the Laurel was replaced by the [[Nissan Maxima]] which was not available as a diesel and had a sportier, more luxurious air. The Laurel was often used as a taxi in Germany.\n \nThe styling of the Nissan Laurel began to resemble the larger [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] but on a slightly smaller platform, with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|reduced tax liability]] based on the vehicles dimensions. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] hardtop and the [[Toyota Mark II|Mark II]] sedan, and in 1986 the [[Honda Vigor]].\n\nIn October 1984 the C32-facelift was released. Osamu Ito, Development Supervisor of the R31/32 Skyline, was assigned to redesign the Laurel. He saw the car needed significant changes, and set about doing so. Some of the Laurel's new features included a 4-door sedan body, variations in the hardtop, an angular design (including a strong push), and the world's first electric retractable door mirrors.\n\nThe RB20E engine was equipped with six-cylinder series SOHC2.0L, VG20ET-SOHC2.0L [[V6]] turbo, CA18S-series four-cylinder (LPG and specifications), LD28-series 6-cylinder diesel SOHC2.8L. The car's system also integrated a C32 steering rack and adopted a rack-and-pinion type.\n \nIn May 1985, the Grand Extra Limited edition was released. Detail improvements were made in October 1985 and January 1986.\n\nIn October 1986 there were mechanical changes along with significant modifications to the exterior. There was a new turbocharged DOHC engine, the 2.0-liter RB20DET 24-valve six-cylinder, while the LD28 diesel engine was replaced by the new RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nIn May 1987 the \"Grande Extra White Special\" edition was release. In August of the same year, the Grande Touring Limited was added to lineup.\n \nIn February 1988 there was an improved and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the \"White Limited\" model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection was added to the lineup. In December private car and driving school versions were discontinued, leaving only taxis and other commercial models. In January 1989 Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a shift lock.\n \nThe taxi/commercial versions of the fifth generation were finally discontinued in July 1993, when they were replaced by the [[Nissan Crew]].\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel C32 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of fifth generation Laurel]]\n[[File:C32 Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist Rear 04711.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist]]{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C33}}\n\n== Sixth generation (C33) (1989\u20131993) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Laurel C33\n| image = LaurelC33.JPG\n| aka = \n| production = [[Japan]]: 1989\u20131993\n| assembly = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| platform = \n| related = [[Nissan Skyline#R32|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Cefiro#A31(1988-1994)|Nissan Cefiro]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S13|Nissan Silvia S13]]\n| layout = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| engine = 1.8 L [[Nissan CA engine|CA18i]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] <br> 2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DET]] [[turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>  2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20E]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]]  [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]] <br> 2.8 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] diesel [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual <br> 4-speed automatic <br> 5-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1365|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1330|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn December 1988, the C33 Laurel was announced. A month later, in January 1989, the C33 went on sale, originally only available as a hardtop four-door. The base engine offering again was a 1.8-litre four, the available options consisted of a 2-litre six (SOHC, DOHC or DOHC Turbo) and a 2.8-litre diesel inline-six. Early in 1991 a DOHC 2.5-litre inline-six coupled to a five-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] became available.\n\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel Medalist in Japan]]\nThe [[Nissan]] Laurel used a [[rear-wheel drive]] layout, making it a popular car to modify for drifting use. The C33 in particular is very popular as a drift car, because it has the same floor plan as the [[Nissan A31 Cefiro]] and the four-door [[Nissan Skyline R32]]. They also have many interchangeable parts which makes them ideal for modification. Suspension parts are identical to the Nissan Silvia S13 model.\n\nThe Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]], and there was also the new [[Honda Inspire]] in the same segment. The Laurel was repositioned slightly higher as a larger luxury sedan, as its exterior dimensions matched with the [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] which were exclusive to separate Japanese Nissan dealerships (''Nissan Bluebird'' for the Cedric, ''Nissan Prince'' for the Gloria). The Laurel still remained the junior sedan to the Nissan flagship [[Nissan President]] which was all new in 1989, and remained exclusive to Japanese dealership ''[[Nissan#Japan|Nissan Motor Store]]'' locations.\n\nTrim levels included the Medalist, Medalist Club S and Gran Limited. The Club S was the only C33 laurel with the RB25DE option and a front lip spoiler, with other models offering only the RB20, CA18 and RD28 engines.\n\nV6 engines were no longer available; instead, the RB20E type (SOHC), RB20DE type (DOHC), RB20DET type (single turbo DOHC) series 6-cylinder 2.0L, CA18i series four-cylinder SOHC1.8L and RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engines were offered. In addition to this, the improved HICAS-II suspension configuration was used. \nFour-cylinder model (CA18i) series and six-cylinder diesel engine (RD28) in the presence and instruction car specifications.\n \nOn January 1991, the Laurel was facelifted and a new RB20E/RB20DE-powered 5-speed AT model crept into the range. Also in November 1991, 3-series cars RB25DE Catalogue DOHC2.5L add a grade-six-cylinder engine. 2.5L existing and additional models equipped with previous generations high mount side lamp, side door airbags.

Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six and a 2.8 L diesel six.\n\nSome of the later models featured more sophistication such as Nissan's proprietary 4-wheel steering ([[HICAS]]) and 4-wheel drive ([[Attesa|ATTESA]]) systems, which were based on the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] models. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] and the [[Honda Inspire]]. This was the first series that was no longer regarded as a compact sedan under Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|vehicle classification regulations]] due to the engine displacement exceeding 2000 &nbsp;cc, and vehicle length and width were no longer in compliance.

Introduced  in 1968 as a new model positioned above the 1968 [[Nissan Bluebird#510 series|Datsun Bluebird 510]], the Laurel offered the luxury of the [[Nissan Cedric#Second generation 130|Nissan Cedric 130]] in a smaller size. The [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] is a noble tree in Greek mythology, and the [[laurel wreath]] a symbol of honorable status. In Japan, the Laurel was not marketed as a Datsun, being always labeled as a Nissan.\n\nThe first Laurel was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] R&D Division and assembled at the [[Musashimurayama]] Plant of the former [[Prince Motor Company]] in 2-door and 4-door variants. Released as a Nissan after Prince merged with Nissan, Laurels shared many components and architectures with the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] range. The Laurel was not marketed new in Japan at ''Nissan Prince Shop'' locations that sold the Skyline and Gloria, former Prince products. Instead the Laurel was sold at ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Motor Shop]]'' as the junior model to the larger V8-powered [[Nissan President]].\n\nSince 1968, eight generations of Laurel have been produced in [[Japan]]. Nissan intermittently listed the Laurel for sale in various [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an markets (it was also sold in [[Chile]] and [[Panama]], as the Datsun Laurel, starting in the late seventies), and then discontinued the [[export]] of this model from 1989.\n\nThe Laurel was cancelled subsequent to Nissan's  [[Renault\u2013Nissan\u2013Mitsubishi Alliance|alliance with Renault]].\n__TOC__\n{{anchor|C30}}\n\n== First generation (C30) (1968\u20131972) ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan Laurel C30.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C30\n| production   = 1968\u20131972\n| body_style   = {{ubl\n  | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9]]\n  | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n  }}\n\n| layout       = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| platform     = \n|caption=Nissan Laurel\n| aka          = {{ubl\n\n  | Datsun Laurel\n\n  | Datsun 200L\n  | Datsun 1800 <ref>[http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html ''1968 Nissan Laurel C30'', www.earlydatsun.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208131718/http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html |date=2015-02-08 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015</ref>\n  }}\n\n| engine       = {{ubl\n\n  | 1.8 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-18|G-18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n\n  | 2.0 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]]'' I4\n  }}\n\n| transmission = {{ubl\n\n  | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n\n  | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n\n| length       = {{convert|4305|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1605|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1405|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1005|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2620|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = {{ubl\n  | [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Nissan Skyline]]\n  }}\n\n}}\n\nIn April 1968 Nissan presented its new Laurel in four-door deLuxe and Super deLuxe versions, both equipped with a 1.8 L [[inline-four engine]] and independent rear suspension.

Its competitors at introduction were the [[Toyota Mark II#T60|Toyota Corona Mark II]] sedan, and the [[Mazda Luce#SU|Mazda Luce]] which was introduced in 1966. The Laurel did not sell as well as expected, largely because the design was too similar to that of the smaller, cheaper [[Datsun 510|Bluebird (510)]].<ref name=shiTak>{{cite journal | journal = Motor Magazine International | date = January 1974 | title = New Model: Nissan Laurel | page = 8 | ref = MMI7 | volume = 2 | number = 1 | location = Tokyo, Japan }}</ref>\n\nThis car was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] vehicle development team, but the C30 Laurel was fitted with the Prince four-cylinder [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, the [[Prince G engine#G-18|G18]]. (On the other hand, the GC10 [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Skyline]] 2000GT was developed by the former Prince [[Ogikubo, Tokyo|Ogikubo]] vehicle development team, but was fitted with Nissan [[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] SOHC engine.)

The four-door sedan was originally only available with the lesser G18.

The saloon now was endowed with a rear beam axle and leaf springs, while the coup\u00e9 clung to independent rear suspension. In addition to the 1.8 and 2.0 L four-cylinder engines, a 2.0 L inline-six was now available, joined, from October, 1973, by a 2.6 L six; the latter was replaced by a 2.8 L six in late 1975. The [[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]] 4-cylinder and L20 [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engines were equipped with [[SU carburetor|SU]] twin carburetors but were eliminated February 1976 due to emission regulations.\n\nThe styling of the coupe appears to be influenced by the 1970 [[Ford Torino#1970\u20131971: New Torino|Ford Torino]] and the 1971 [[Mercury Cougar#Second generation|Mercury Cougar]], reflecting a popular styling trend during the 1960s and 1970s called \"[[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]]\". Sales in Japan (very few were exported) ran to about 96,000 per year, with three-quarters sedans.<ref name=MMI9>[[#MMI7|Motor Magazine International (January 1974)]], pp. 9-10</ref> The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Mark II#Generation 2 (1972\u20131976) X10/X20 series|Mark II]] coup\u00e9 and sedan.\n\n[[File:Datsun 200L sedan (C130) in Norway B+W.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun 200L sedan (Europe)]]\nEngines available at the time were the four-cylinder 1815&nbsp;cc G18 and 1990&nbsp;cc G20, and the six-cylinder 1998&nbsp;cc L20. Both the G20 and L20 were available with twin SU carburettors as an option. However, only the G20 equipped cars outwardly announced this with a \"Twin Carburettor 2000GX\" badge.\n\nIn October 1973 the first Laurel with the 2565&nbsp;cc L26 six-cylinder engine was added and badged as \"2600SGL\". Since the engine was over two litres, it was not restrained by the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|size limits]] imposed by Japanese regulations, and therefore it was fitted with bigger bumpers than regular Laurels. The installation of the 2.6-litre engine in Japanese models helped identify this generation as a luxury car, as the larger engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay higher amounts of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n\nIn September 1975, in order to meet the new emissions regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753&nbsp;cc L28 six-cylinder. By October the carburettors in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770&nbsp;cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup.\n\nIn February 1976 carburetted 1.8-litre and 2.0-litre engines which met the 1976 emissions regulations were introduced, and were identified with the [[Nissan NAPS]] badge.\n\n[[File:1974 Nissan Laurel Hadtop 2000SGX rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel 2000SGX Hardtop (C130) with non-standard wheels]]\n\n==={{anchor|EV|C130-EV}} Laurel C130-EV===\nIn 1974 Nissan developed an electric passenger sedan based on the Nissan Laurel.

November 1982 saw the introduction of the Limited \"Givenchy Version\" with [[Hubert de Givenchy]] doing the TV commercials in Japan, borrowing a marketing concept for an American luxury coupe, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV Designer Editions|Lincoln Continental Mark IV]]. In 1981, the [[Nissan Sunny#B11 (1981\u20131985)|Nissan Laurel Spirit]] was offered as a smaller alternative to the Laurel, while still offering the luxury content of the larger car.\n\n[[File:1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop (C31, Chile)]]\nDevelopment Supervisor, Itirou Makoto Sakurai, was in charge of developing the Laurel together with the Skyline. The Laurel's redesign was carried out in a European style and tone. The coefficient of drag (Cd value) of the four-door hardtop is 0.38. The lowest-priced Z18 is a four-cylinder engine, as is the 2-litre Z20. The L20-series are inline-six cylinder models, also available in fuel injected L20E type, and as the turbocharged L20ET - the first turbocharged Laurel. On top of the lineup was the 2.8-litre L28E, and for some export markets the 2.4-litre L24 engine (usually carburetted) was also offered. Mostly for commercial use there was the four-cylinder LD20 diesel engine, while private users usually preferred the larger six-cylinder LD28 type which was also available with much better equipment.\n\nIn February 1981 the GX trim level was added. L20E sedan with independent rear suspension in the vehicle suspension formula (a six-link independent rear suspension was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981 the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup.\n\nIn September 1982 there was a minor change. Up a sense of luxury and large-scale extrusion in the chrome bumpers and rear license plate holder. The tail lamp design was changed as well. Instead of the Z18 series engine, the new OHC four-cylinder 1809&nbsp;cc CA18S engine was fitted to the Laurel 1.8. The engine range was overhauled at the time and now included the CA18S, L20E, turbocharged L20ET, the four-cylinder SOHC Z20S, and the diesel LD20 and LD28-6 models. The carburetted L20, the L28E, and the column-shifted LD20 (six-seater) were discontinued. The six-cylinder gasoline-powered car with automatic transmission and Super Touring equipment received an overdrive gear at the same time.\n\nIn November 1982 the Givenchy limited version was released. In February 1983 the \"50 Special\" released. In March the Givenchy II version went on sale. In May another 50 Special II vehicles were launched. In July electrically retractable fender and door mirrors were introduced, a first. In October, taxi and driver instruction vehicles with an OHC LPG four-cylinder engine (Z18P, Standard or GL equipment) were added.

It also came with the [[Nissan L engine#LD28|LD28]] diesel. In 1987 there were a minor facelift which basically were bigger bumpers, new grilles, and new lights in the front and back. The [[Nissan L engine#LD28|LD28]] diesel engine were swapped out in favor of the similarly dimensioned [[Nissan RD engine#RD25|RD28]]. This generation became the first Laurel with a [[V6 engine]].\n\nThe C32 was the last model to be sold outside Japan. In Europe the Laurel was replaced by the [[Nissan Maxima]] which was not available as a diesel and had a sportier, more luxurious air. The Laurel was often used as a taxi in Germany.\n \nThe styling of the Nissan Laurel began to resemble the larger [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] but on a slightly smaller platform, with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|reduced tax liability]] based on the vehicles dimensions. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] hardtop and the [[Toyota Mark II|Mark II]] sedan, and in 1986 the [[Honda Vigor]].\n\nIn October 1984 the C32-facelift was released. Osamu Ito, Development Supervisor of the R31/32 Skyline, was assigned to redesign the Laurel. He saw the car needed significant changes, and set about doing so. Some of the Laurel's new features included a 4-door sedan body, variations in the hardtop, an angular design (including a strong push), and the world's first electric retractable door mirrors.\n\nThe RB20E engine was equipped with six-cylinder series SOHC2.0L, VG20ET-SOHC2.0L [[V6]] turbo, CA18S-series four-cylinder (LPG and specifications), LD28-series 6-cylinder diesel SOHC2.8L. The car's system also integrated a C32 steering rack and adopted a rack-and-pinion type.\n \nIn May 1985, the Grand Extra Limited edition was released. Detail improvements were made in October 1985 and January 1986.\n\nIn October 1986 there were mechanical changes along with significant modifications to the exterior. There was a new turbocharged DOHC engine, the 2.0-liter RB20DET 24-valve six-cylinder, while the LD28 diesel engine was replaced by the new RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nIn May 1987 the \"Grande Extra White Special\" edition was release. In August of the same year, the Grande Touring Limited was added to lineup.\n \nIn February 1988 there was an improved and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the \"White Limited\" model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection was added to the lineup. In December private car and driving school versions were discontinued, leaving only taxis and other commercial models. In January 1989 Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a shift lock.\n \nThe taxi/commercial versions of the fifth generation were finally discontinued in July 1993, when they were replaced by the [[Nissan Crew]].\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel C32 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of fifth generation Laurel]]\n[[File:C32 Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist Rear 04711.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist]]{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C33}}\n\n== Sixth generation (C33) (1989\u20131993) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Laurel C33\n| image = LaurelC33.JPG\n| aka = \n| production = [[Japan]]: 1989\u20131993\n| assembly = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| platform = \n| related = [[Nissan Skyline#R32|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Cefiro#A31(1988-1994)|Nissan Cefiro]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S13|Nissan Silvia S13]]\n| layout = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| engine = 1.8 L [[Nissan CA engine|CA18i]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] <br> 2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DET]] [[turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>  2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20E]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]]  [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]] <br> 2.8 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] diesel [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual <br> 4-speed automatic <br> 5-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1365|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1330|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn December 1988, the C33 Laurel was announced. A month later, in January 1989, the C33 went on sale, originally only available as a hardtop four-door. The base engine offering again was a 1.8-litre four, the available options consisted of a 2-litre six (SOHC, DOHC or DOHC Turbo) and a 2.8-litre diesel inline-six. Early in 1991 a DOHC 2.5-litre inline-six coupled to a five-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] became available.\n\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel Medalist in Japan]]\nThe [[Nissan]] Laurel used a [[rear-wheel drive]] layout, making it a popular car to modify for drifting use. The C33 in particular is very popular as a drift car, because it has the same floor plan as the [[Nissan A31 Cefiro]] and the four-door [[Nissan Skyline R32]]. They also have many interchangeable parts which makes them ideal for modification. Suspension parts are identical to the Nissan Silvia S13 model.\n\nThe Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]], and there was also the new [[Honda Inspire]] in the same segment. The Laurel was repositioned slightly higher as a larger luxury sedan, as its exterior dimensions matched with the [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] which were exclusive to separate Japanese Nissan dealerships (''Nissan Bluebird'' for the Cedric, ''Nissan Prince'' for the Gloria). The Laurel still remained the junior sedan to the Nissan flagship [[Nissan President]] which was all new in 1989, and remained exclusive to Japanese dealership ''[[Nissan#Japan|Nissan Motor Store]]'' locations.\n\nTrim levels included the Medalist, Medalist Club S and Gran Limited. The Club S was the only C33 laurel with the RB25DE option and a front lip spoiler, with other models offering only the RB20, CA18 and RD28 engines.\n\nV6 engines were no longer available; instead, the RB20E type (SOHC), RB20DE type (DOHC), RB20DET type (single turbo DOHC) series 6-cylinder 2.0L, CA18i series four-cylinder SOHC1.8L and RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engines were offered. In addition to this, the improved HICAS-II suspension configuration was used. \nFour-cylinder model (CA18i) series and six-cylinder diesel engine (RD28) in the presence and instruction car specifications.\n \nOn January 1991, the Laurel was facelifted and a new RB20E/RB20DE-powered 5-speed AT model crept into the range. Also in November 1991, 3-series cars RB25DE Catalogue DOHC2.5L add a grade-six-cylinder engine. 2.5L existing and additional models equipped with previous generations high mount side lamp, side door airbags. Organizing models in the senior grades.\n\nIn the [[North America]]n market, this was only sold in parts of the [[Caribbean]], primarily the [[Bahamas]] under the '''Nissan Laurel Altima'''.  However, the [[Nissan Altima|Altima]] name was first used in the [[United States]] & [[Canada]] starting in the 1993 model year for its new [[compact car]], which has since become a [[mid-size]] in 2002.\n  \nBy January 1992 cumulative production achieved 2 million units.{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C34}}\n\n== Seventh generation (C34) (1993\u20131997) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan C34 Laurel.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C34\n| production   = 1993-1997\n| body_style   = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = \n| engine       = 2.0 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB20E]]<br> 2.0 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]]<br> 2.5 L [[Turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DET]]<br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]]<br> 2.8 L Diesel [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual(Diesel)<br>4-speed automatic <br>5-speed automatic\n| length       = {{convert|4710|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1390|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1490|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = [[Nissan Skyline#R33|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Stagea]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S14|Nissan Silvia S14]]\n}}\nThe Laurel C34 was no longer available in hardtop sedan configuration; the single body style offered was the regular saloon with B-posts. Gone as well was the four-cylinder engine. Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six and a 2.8 L diesel six.\n\nSome of the later models featured more sophistication such as Nissan's proprietary 4-wheel steering ([[HICAS]]) and 4-wheel drive ([[Attesa|ATTESA]]) systems, which were based on the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] models. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] and the [[Honda Inspire]]. This was the first series that was no longer regarded as a compact sedan under Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|vehicle classification regulations]] due to the engine displacement exceeding 2000 &nbsp;cc, and vehicle length and width were no longer in compliance.

The letter said that the statement, first made by a former Smithsonian curator, that \"Steamtown was a second-rate collection on a third-rate site,\" was unfounded.<ref name= letter /> Scranton and Panuska added, \"The collection of 29 steam engines and 82 other railroad cars and equipment is the third largest in the country, the only one available for commemorating the industrialization of America in a historic setting.\"<ref name= letter/> They said that the 19th-century American [[Industrial Revolution]] was under-represented in the National Parks system<ref name= letter/> and further charged:\n<blockquote>Scranton is the only city in the Eastern United States with the vestiges of the era of industrialization (1840-1920) in plain sight, 40 acres in the middle of downtown, with car shops, locomotive shops, roundhouse, turntable, grand passenger station, a working yard, iron furnaces, passenger excursions \u2014 the whole works and a restored coal mine nearby. There is no other site like it. This city [Scranton] was founded because of its iron ore and its ability to produce rails (previously imported from England), followed by its graduation to a coal and steel economy.

The railroad passed to [[Conrail]], and the site was eventually bought from them by the city of Scranton as the site for Steamtown, USA.

McDade Center for Technology and Applied Research, and the county's [[McDade Park]], with its Anthracite Coal Museum. But the congressman's crowning achievement is a historic theme park called Steamtown.<ref name= Newsweek /></blockquote> Aside from the government spending and the tactics used to ensure the spending, the article repeated the charge that the collection was second-rate. It went on to say that at the site there was little evidence of the money that had been spent; several of the pieces were from the 1940s and 1950s, as opposed to the 19th century, which was the time period that was supposedly being preserved; that some of the better pieces of equipment were actually foreign, [[Canada|Canadian]], to be precise; other museums, already in existence, were already fulfilling the historical mission of Steamtown; and that other NPS projects like [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] were in desperate need of funding.<ref name= Newsweek /> Nevertheless, in 1992, the House of Representatives voted against dropping the project from the NPS and, instead voted to add an additional $14 million to its funding.<ref name= House>''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r_4wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2424,2501395&dq=steamtown&hl=en House Rejects Steamtown Proposal]''.

It went on to say that at the site there was little evidence of the money that had been spent; several of the pieces were from the 1940s and 1950s, as opposed to the 19th century, which was the time period that was supposedly being preserved; that some of the better pieces of equipment were actually foreign, [[Canada|Canadian]], to be precise; other museums, already in existence, were already fulfilling the historical mission of Steamtown; and that other NPS projects like [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] were in desperate need of funding.<ref name= Newsweek /> Nevertheless, in 1992, the House of Representatives voted against dropping the project from the NPS and, instead voted to add an additional $14 million to its funding.<ref name= House>''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r_4wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jeEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2424,2501395&dq=steamtown&hl=en House Rejects Steamtown Proposal]''.

The Wolfpack were a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC). The team went 26\u201310 on the year, winning the [[1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] and the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA National Championship]].\n\n==Cinderella run==\nThe Wolfpack entered the season ranked in the Top 20 and entered conference play ranked #19 in the nation. Their first conference game was against [[1982-83 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia]], ranked #2 in the country at the time and undefeated against the Wolfpack's senior class. NC State took a lead early behind the shooting of guard and senior captain [[Dereck Whittenburg]], but later in the game Whittenburg went down with a broken foot after landing on a Virginia player Othell Wilson's foot following a shot. He would miss the rest of the game and the seventeen that followed, with the Wolfpack losing to Virginia and going 10\u20137 in the other games.\n\nNC State entered the ACC Tournament in Atlanta with ten losses. The NCAA had expanded the men's tournament field from 48 teams to 52 for 1983, meaning that there were four extra spots available for potential qualifiers. Still, with a 64-team field some years away from being implemented, there was not much room for error for the Wolfpack with double-digit losses and their safest bet to reach the tournament was to secure the ACC champion's automatic bid. They did just that, winning three games in the tournament to claim the title. In the process, NC State defeated Wake Forest, their in-state rival [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], the defending national champions, and managed to finally defeat #2 Virginia to claim the title.\n\nOn Selection Sunday, NC State found out it would be playing in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#West region|West Region]] of the tournament as the number six seed. This region presented the Wolfpack with a potentially difficult road to the Final Four. All four of the top seeds in the region were ranked within the top 11 in the final polls and three of those schools had spent time as the top ranked team in the nation. Virginia, their conference rival and ranked #4 after the Wolfpack defeated them, was placed in the region as its number one seed. The second seed was [[Larry Farmer (basketball)|Larry Farmer]]'s [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]], which had spent most of the season near the top five in the polls and finished ranked #7. The third seed was the [[Big West Conference|PCAA]] champion, [[Jerry Tarkanian]]'s [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels men's basketball|UNLV Runnin' Rebels]], which had won its first twenty-four games before losing and finished at #6 with 28 victories. In addition, all three of these squads had spent time at number one.\n\nUnlike today's tournament, which tends to place higher seeded teams closer to their home for the first weekend of the tournament, all of the four regions took place within their specific geographical area of the country. As the #6 seed in the West Region, the Wolfpack were sent to [[Corvallis, Oregon]] to play in the sub-regional games at [[Oregon State University]]'s [[Gill Coliseum]]. There, in their first matchup, they played the #11 seeded team, [[West Coast Conference]] champion [[Pepperdine Waves men's basketball|Pepperdine]], for the right to face UNLV in the second round (as part of the tournament structure at the time, the top four seeds in each region were given byes to the second round). The Wolfpack rallied late to force overtime and then forced a second overtime before emerging victorious. They then stunned UNLV by winning 71-70 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nThe West Regional was held at the [[Dee Events Center]] at what is now [[Weber State University]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah. The Wolfpack won easily over [[Western Athletic Conference]] champion [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]], the #10 seed whose coach [[Jerry Pimm]] led them to an upset of UCLA in Corvallis. This set up a rematch between NC State and Virginia, who toppled #4 seeded [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]], led by future national championship winner [[Gary Williams (basketball coach)|Gary Williams]], in the other regional semifinal. For the third time in four games, NC State emerged with a close victory, winning 62-61 after Virginia star [[Ralph Sampson]] missed a shot as time expired.\n\nAt the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Final Four|Final Four]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], the Wolfpack finished off their run to the championship game by defeating [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] in the semifinals on Saturday, which set up a matchup with top-ranked and heavily-favored [[1982-83 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|Houston]] on Monday night at [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]]. During this run, N.C. State earned the nickname \"Cardiac Pack\" based in part on their \"Wolfpack\" mascot and the series of close games that took them to the title.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Fouling strategy==\nHead coach [[Jim Valvano]] was noted for employing a then-little used strategy late in games. The NCAA had yet to adopt a shot clock for college basketball, and as the games wore on some teams were just content to keep possession of the ball late in games to protect a lead, passing the ball around until the clock hit zero. Valvano would instruct his players to intentionally foul opposing players, thus putting them on the free-throw line. While this strategy was risky, as it allowed NC State's opponents a chance to increase their lead, it enabled the Wolfpack to extend the game as each foul stopped the clock and the team could also capitalize if the opponents missed their free throws. They used this to great effect in the ACC tournament, including against rival North Carolina and Virginia, and employed it again in four of their six NCAA victories. Nowhere was the strategy more widely seen, however, than in the national championship game.\n\n==National championship game==\nIn the final game on April 4 in Albuquerque, NC State led at halftime by a score of 33\u201325. Houston was hampered by foul trouble that plagued star [[Clyde Drexler]], who picked up three fouls within the first few minutes. Drexler begged to remain in the game, but was forced to come out after Wolfpack sophomore guard [[Terry Gannon]] drew a charging foul on him. The foul was controversial as replays showed that Gannon appeared to grab Drexler's legs as he went down, and Drexler believed the foul should have gone against Gannon and not him (Gannon later said that Drexler never forgot the call; in the ESPN [[Documentary film|documentary]] about the team, he told his teammates that years later, by which time he had become a sports broadcaster, Gannon saw Drexler in the locker room at the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]] and once Drexler found out who he was he instantly cursed him out over the foul).\n\nIn the second half, the Cougars came out with a second wind and established control of the game. With Cougars coach [[Guy Lewis]] shifting his focus to getting center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] the basketball on offense, using the advantage he had over NC State's big men [[Lorenzo Charles]] and [[Cozell McQueen]], Houston outscored the Wolfpack 17\u20132 in the first ten minutes of the half to give themselves a 42\u201335 lead.\n\nHowever, things were not all good for Houston. Albuquerque is located in the [[Sandia Mountains]] in New Mexico and has an elevation of {{convert|5100|ft|-1|adj=on}}. Thus, as is the case with other high-altitude cities, athletes are tested by the effects of the elevation as well as their own physical capabilities. One of the players most affected by the altitude change was Olajuwon, who had taken on an increased workload to try and get his team back in the game. Eventually, Coach Lewis had to take Olajuwon out of the game so he could take oxygen and recover. He then decided that in order to preserve his star center's health, the Cougars needed to start slowing the game down. Thus, he called for his \"Locomotion\" offensive set to be put into play. This meant that instead of driving to the basket every possession, Houston would pass the ball around to wind down the clock before passing to one of the designated scorers.\n\nThe move, however, failed for two reasons. One, it deviated from Houston's strength by abandoning their strategy of pushing the ball up the court. Second, it enabled Valvano to go to his fallback option of extending the game by fouling. Exacerbating the situation was the fact that Houston, as high powered offensively as it was, had not been a strong free-throw shooting team during the season. As such, the Wolfpack were able to both force the Cougars into mistakes and take advantage of the missed free throws to chip away at Houston's advantage. NC State outscored Houston 17\u201310 in the eight minutes that followed and tied the game at 52.\n\nOn what would be Houston's last possession, Valvano called for his defenders to sit back and let Cougars point guard Alvin Franklin advance the ball and begin passing it around. Lewis wanted to keep the ball in the hands of Drexler and sophomore forward [[Reid Gettys]], his two best foul shooters, to try and force them to foul either one of those two players and for anyone else to quickly give it up once they had the ball. Valvano instead wanted Franklin, a freshman, to take the shots and instructed his players to foul him once he got the ball back. Franklin received the ball with 1:05 left but instead of immediately passing it, as he had done already on the play, he held the ball for an additional second. Wolfpack senior point guard [[Dereck Whittenburg]] took advantage of Franklin's momentary lapse in concentration and committed the foul to send Franklin, a 63% free throw shooter, to the line for a one-and-one. The idea, as later stated by Whittenburg and fellow senior [[Thurl Bailey]] years later, was to not only put a poor foul shooter on the line but force Franklin, as the youngest starter on the squad, to face the enormity of the moment with a sellout crowd at The Pit and millions of viewers watching at home. Whatever the idea may have ultimately been, it worked as Franklin missed the shot. NC State took the rebound and with 44 seconds on the clock, Valvano called a time out and drew up a final play for his point guard Whittenburg to take the last shot.\n\nHouston, meanwhile, needed a defensive stop to extend the game. Lewis decided to move from the man-to-man defense his team had been running the whole game to a half court trap with [[Benny Anders]] as the point man, with the goal being to force NC State to spread the ball around and force a turnover. The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control. The ball eventually found its way to [[Sidney Lowe]], who found Bailey standing in the lower left-hand corner of the court and passed it his way so he could take the shot. Bailey, however, wanted no part of Lowe's idea as he had not had a good half shooting the ball and began looking back toward Whittenburg. With a pair of defenders on him, Bailey threw what his teammate later called a \"poor fundamental\" overhand pass that Anders could easily have stolen.\n\nAt that moment Whittenburg harkened back to his high school days with [[Morgan Wootten]] at [[DeMatha Catholic High School]] in the Maryland suburbs of [[Washington, D.C.]] One thing Wootten always taught his players was that when receiving the ball, bring it in with both hands. As Anders went for the ball, Whittenburg was able to put that lesson to use and by getting his other hand on the ball, he was able to get more control of it and prevent Anders from knocking it away. Anders was only able to get his fingertips on the ball, which temporarily stripped the ball from Whittenburg but did not enable him to take it away. Had Anders been able to steal, he would have likely had an uncontested breakaway to the other end of the court where he could have easily dunked the ball and given the Cougars the lead. Since the rules of the day dictated that the entire game be played with a running clock, the Wolfpack would most likely not have been able to get the ball up the court in time for a potential tying shot.\n\nWhen Whittenburg regained control, five seconds were showing on the clock and he turned to try to get some sort of shot off from his position thirty-five feet from the goal. While the shot was in line with the basket, Whittenburg had not gotten enough on it and the ball was going to come up well short.  At the foot of the goal stood Olajuwon and Wolfpack center [[Lorenzo Charles]], who watched Whittenburg's air ball. Olajuwon hesitated briefly, as he was in position to grab the ball and likely force overtime but did not want to jump too soon and be called for goaltending. Charles took advantage of the hesitation and went up for the errant shot. With two seconds left on the clock Charles took the ball and drove it through the hoop with two hands for the decisive score and gave the Wolfpack its first national championship since 1974.\n\n==''30 for 30''==\nThe team's story was chronicled in \"Survive and Advance\", an episode in the [[ESPN]] ''[[30 for 30]]'' series. [[Dereck Whittenburg]] produced the [[Documentary film|documentary]] and was one of several players who appeared in it, alongside his teammates [[Thurl Bailey]], [[Sidney Lowe]], [[Terry Gannon]], [[Cozell McQueen]], and Ernie Myers. Valvano's widow, Pam Valvano Strasser, also appears in the documentary as do several of his assistants. [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Dave Rose (basketball)|David Rose]], and [[Reid Gettys]] of the defeated Houston squad also appear to offer their take on their loss, as do then-North Carolina assistant Roy Williams and then-Pepperdine coach [[Jim Harrick]], whose teams were defeated in the ACC and NCAA tournaments by the Wolfpack. [[Mike Krzyzewski]] is also featured prominently in the film, describing how his relationship with Valvano (who started at NC State the same year Krzyzewski took over at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]) evolved over the years from an adversarial one to one where the two men became close friends.\n\nIn addition to the 1982\u201383 team's season (and their 30-year reunion, which is marked by the absence of the recently deceased Lorenzo Charles), Valvano's career after that season is a major focal point, including the scandal that led to his resignation from NC State in 1990.\n\nThe emotional impact Valvano's [[cancer]] diagnosis had on his players and coaches is also heavily featured. In addition to Valvano's famous speech at the 1993 [[ESPY Award]]s, special attention is paid to his appearance at the ceremony honoring the 1982\u201383 team held several weeks earlier. Valvano had not been expected to attend, partly due to his illness but also to lingering bad feelings present from his forced resignation three years earlier. However, in what would prove to be the last time many of his players would see him, Valvano made his appearance toward the end of the ceremony and spoke to the crowd about how the team never gave up and how it inspired him to continue his fight against cancer.\n\n==Schedule==\n\n{{CBB schedule start\n| rank      = \n| gamehighs =\n| attend    =\n}}\n{{CBB schedule entry\n| date         = November

The Wolfpack were a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC). The team went 26\u201310 on the year, winning the [[1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] and the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA National Championship]].\n\n==Cinderella run==\nThe Wolfpack entered the season ranked in the Top 20 and entered conference play ranked #19 in the nation. Their first conference game was against [[1982-83 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia]], ranked #2 in the country at the time and undefeated against the Wolfpack's senior class. NC State took a lead early behind the shooting of guard and senior captain [[Dereck Whittenburg]], but later in the game Whittenburg went down with a broken foot after landing on a Virginia player Othell Wilson's foot following a shot. He would miss the rest of the game and the seventeen that followed, with the Wolfpack losing to Virginia and going 10\u20137 in the other games.\n\nNC State entered the ACC Tournament in Atlanta with ten losses. The NCAA had expanded the men's tournament field from 48 teams to 52 for 1983, meaning that there were four extra spots available for potential qualifiers. Still, with a 64-team field some years away from being implemented, there was not much room for error for the Wolfpack with double-digit losses and their safest bet to reach the tournament was to secure the ACC champion's automatic bid. They did just that, winning three games in the tournament to claim the title. In the process, NC State defeated Wake Forest, their in-state rival [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], the defending national champions, and managed to finally defeat #2 Virginia to claim the title.\n\nOn Selection Sunday, NC State found out it would be playing in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#West region|West Region]] of the tournament as the number six seed. This region presented the Wolfpack with a potentially difficult road to the Final Four. All four of the top seeds in the region were ranked within the top 11 in the final polls and three of those schools had spent time as the top ranked team in the nation. Virginia, their conference rival and ranked #4 after the Wolfpack defeated them, was placed in the region as its number one seed. The second seed was [[Larry Farmer]]'s [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]], which had spent most of the season near the top five in the polls and finished ranked #7. The third seed was the [[Big West Conference|PCAA]] champion, [[Jerry Tarkanian]]'s [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels men's basketball|UNLV Runnin' Rebels]], which had won its first twenty-four games before losing and finished at #6 with 28 victories. In addition, all three of these squads had spent time at number one.\n\nUnlike today's tournament, which tends to place higher seeded teams closer to their home for the first weekend of the tournament, all of the four regions took place within their specific geographical area of the country. As the #6 seed in the West Region, the Wolfpack were sent to [[Corvallis, Oregon]] to play in the sub-regional games at [[Oregon State University]]'s [[Gill Coliseum]]. There, in their first matchup, they played the #11 seeded team, [[West Coast Conference]] champion [[Pepperdine Waves men's basketball|Pepperdine]], for the right to face UNLV in the second round (as part of the tournament structure at the time, the top four seeds in each region were given byes to the second round). The Wolfpack rallied late to force overtime and then forced a second overtime before emerging victorious. They then stunned UNLV by winning 71-70 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nThe West Regional was held at the [[Dee Events Center]] at what is now [[Weber State University]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah. The Wolfpack won easily over [[Western Athletic Conference]] champion [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]], the #10 seed whose coach [[Jerry Pimm]] led them to an upset of UCLA in Corvallis. This set up a rematch between NC State and Virginia, who toppled #4 seeded [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]], led by future national championship winner [[Gary Williams (basketball coach)|Gary Williams]], in the other regional semifinal. For the third time in four games, NC State emerged with a close victory, winning 62-61 after Virginia star [[Ralph Sampson]] missed a shot as time expired.\n\nAt the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Final Four|Final Four]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], the Wolfpack finished off their run to the championship game by defeating [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] in the semifinals on Saturday, which set up a matchup with top-ranked and heavily-favored [[1982-83 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|Houston]] on Monday night at [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]]. During this run, N.C. State earned the nickname \"Cardiac Pack\" based in part on their \"Wolfpack\" mascot and the series of close games that took them to the title.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Fouling strategy==\nHead coach [[Jim Valvano]] was noted for employing a then-little used strategy late in games. The NCAA had yet to adopt a shot clock for college basketball, and as the games wore on some teams were just content to keep possession of the ball late in games to protect a lead, passing the ball around until the clock hit zero. Valvano would instruct his players to intentionally foul opposing players, thus putting them on the free-throw line. While this strategy was risky, as it allowed NC State's opponents a chance to increase their lead, it enabled the Wolfpack to extend the game as each foul stopped the clock and the team could also capitalize if the opponents missed their free throws. They used this to great effect in the ACC tournament, including against rival North Carolina and Virginia, and employed it again in four of their six NCAA victories. Nowhere was the strategy more widely seen, however, than in the national championship game.\n\n==National championship game==\nIn the final game on April 4 in Albuquerque, NC State led at halftime by a score of 33\u201325. Houston was hampered by foul trouble that plagued star [[Clyde Drexler]], who picked up three fouls within the first few minutes. Drexler begged to remain in the game, but was forced to come out after Wolfpack sophomore guard [[Terry Gannon]] drew a charging foul on him. The foul was controversial as replays showed that Gannon appeared to grab Drexler's legs as he went down, and Drexler believed the foul should have gone against Gannon and not him (Gannon later said that Drexler never forgot the call; in the ESPN [[Documentary film|documentary]] about the team, he told his teammates that years later, by which time he had become a sports broadcaster, Gannon saw Drexler in the locker room at the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]] and once Drexler found out who he was he instantly cursed him out over the foul).\n\nIn the second half, the Cougars came out with a second wind and established control of the game. With Cougars coach [[Guy Lewis]] shifting his focus to getting center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] the basketball on offense, using the advantage he had over NC State's big men [[Lorenzo Charles]] and [[Cozell McQueen]], Houston outscored the Wolfpack 17\u20132 in the first ten minutes of the half to give themselves a 42\u201335 lead.\n\nHowever, things were not all good for Houston. Albuquerque is located in the [[Sandia Mountains]] in New Mexico and has an elevation of {{convert|5100|ft|-1|adj=on}}. Thus, as is the case with other high-altitude cities, athletes are tested by the effects of the elevation as well as their own physical capabilities. One of the players most affected by the altitude change was Olajuwon, who had taken on an increased workload to try and get his team back in the game. Eventually, Coach Lewis had to take Olajuwon out of the game so he could take oxygen and recover. He then decided that in order to preserve his star center's health, the Cougars needed to start slowing the game down. Thus, he called for his \"Locomotion\" offensive set to be put into play. This meant that instead of driving to the basket every possession, Houston would pass the ball around to wind down the clock before passing to one of the designated scorers.\n\nThe move, however, failed for two reasons. One, it deviated from Houston's strength by abandoning their strategy of pushing the ball up the court. Second, it enabled Valvano to go to his fallback option of extending the game by fouling. Exacerbating the situation was the fact that Houston, as high powered offensively as it was, had not been a strong free-throw shooting team during the season. As such, the Wolfpack were able to both force the Cougars into mistakes and take advantage of the missed free throws to chip away at Houston's advantage. NC State outscored Houston 17\u201310 in the eight minutes that followed and tied the game at 52.\n\nOn what would be Houston's last possession, Valvano called for his defenders to sit back and let Cougars point guard Alvin Franklin advance the ball and begin passing it around. Lewis wanted to keep the ball in the hands of Drexler and sophomore forward [[Reid Gettys]], his two best foul shooters, to try and force them to foul either one of those two players and for anyone else to quickly give it up once they had the ball. Valvano instead wanted Franklin, a freshman, to take the shots and instructed his players to foul him once he got the ball back. Franklin received the ball with 1:05 left but instead of immediately passing it, as he had done already on the play, he held the ball for an additional second. Wolfpack senior point guard [[Dereck Whittenburg]] took advantage of Franklin's momentary lapse in concentration and committed the foul to send Franklin, a 63% free throw shooter, to the line for a one-and-one. The idea, as later stated by Whittenburg and fellow senior [[Thurl Bailey]] years later, was to not only put a poor foul shooter on the line but force Franklin, as the youngest starter on the squad, to face the enormity of the moment with a sellout crowd at The Pit and millions of viewers watching at home. Whatever the idea may have ultimately been, it worked as Franklin missed the shot. NC State took the rebound and with 44 seconds on the clock, Valvano called a time out and drew up a final play for his point guard Whittenburg to take the last shot.\n\nHouston, meanwhile, needed a defensive stop to extend the game. Lewis decided to move from the man-to-man defense his team had been running the whole game to a half court trap with [[Benny Anders]] as the point man, with the goal being to force NC State to spread the ball around and force a turnover. The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control. The ball eventually found its way to [[Sidney Lowe]], who found Bailey standing in the lower left-hand corner of the court and passed it his way so he could take the shot. Bailey, however, wanted no part of Lowe's idea as he had not had a good half shooting the ball and began looking back toward Whittenburg. With a pair of defenders on him, Bailey threw what his teammate later called a \"poor fundamental\" overhand pass that Anders could easily have stolen.\n\nAt that moment Whittenburg harkened back to his high school days with [[Morgan Wootten]] at [[DeMatha Catholic High School]] in the Maryland suburbs of [[Washington, D.C.]] One thing Wootten always taught his players was that when receiving the ball, bring it in with both hands. As Anders went for the ball, Whittenburg was able to put that lesson to use and by getting his other hand on the ball, he was able to get more control of it and prevent Anders from knocking it away. Anders was only able to get his fingertips on the ball, which temporarily stripped the ball from Whittenburg but did not enable him to take it away. Had Anders been able to steal, he would have likely had an uncontested breakaway to the other end of the court where he could have easily dunked the ball and given the Cougars the lead. Since the rules of the day dictated that the entire game be played with a running clock, the Wolfpack would most likely not have been able to get the ball up the court in time for a potential tying shot.\n\nWhen Whittenburg regained control, five seconds were showing on the clock and he turned to try to get some sort of shot off from his position thirty-five feet from the goal. While the shot was in line with the basket, Whittenburg had not gotten enough on it and the ball was going to come up well short.  At the foot of the goal stood Olajuwon and Wolfpack center [[Lorenzo Charles]], who watched Whittenburg's air ball. Olajuwon hesitated briefly, as he was in position to grab the ball and likely force overtime but did not want to jump too soon and be called for goaltending. Charles took advantage of the hesitation and went up for the errant shot. With two seconds left on the clock Charles took the ball and drove it through the hoop with two hands for the decisive score and gave the Wolfpack its first national championship since 1974.\n\n==''30 for 30''==\nThe team's story was chronicled in \"Survive and Advance\", an episode in the [[ESPN]] ''[[30 for 30]]'' series. [[Dereck Whittenburg]] produced the [[Documentary film|documentary]] and was one of several players who appeared in it, alongside his teammates [[Thurl Bailey]], [[Sidney Lowe]], [[Terry Gannon]], [[Cozell McQueen]], and Ernie Myers. Valvano's widow, Pam Valvano Strasser, also appears in the documentary as do several of his assistants. [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Dave Rose (basketball)|David Rose]], and [[Reid Gettys]] of the defeated Houston squad also appear to offer their take on their loss, as do then-North Carolina assistant Roy Williams and then-Pepperdine coach [[Jim Harrick]], whose teams were defeated in the ACC and NCAA tournaments by the Wolfpack. [[Mike Krzyzewski]] is also featured prominently in the film, describing how his relationship with Valvano (who started at NC State the same year Krzyzewski took over at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]) evolved over the years from an adversarial one to one where the two men became close friends.\n\nIn addition to the 1982\u201383 team's season (and their 30-year reunion, which is marked by the absence of the recently deceased Lorenzo Charles), Valvano's career after that season is a major focal point, including the scandal that led to his resignation from NC State in 1990.\n\nThe emotional impact Valvano's [[cancer]] diagnosis had on his players and coaches is also heavily featured. In addition to Valvano's famous speech at the 1993 [[ESPY Award]]s, special attention is paid to his appearance at the ceremony honoring the 1982\u201383 team held several weeks earlier. Valvano had not been expected to attend, partly due to his illness but also to lingering bad feelings present from his forced resignation three years earlier. However, in what would prove to be the last time many of his players would see him, Valvano made his appearance toward the end of the ceremony and spoke to the crowd about how the team never gave up and how it inspired him to continue his fight against cancer.\n\n==Schedule==\n\n{{CBB schedule start\n| rank      = \n| gamehighs =\n| attend    =\n}}\n{{CBB schedule entry\n| date         = November

It is one of [[Delhi]]'s major shopping centres.\n\n==History==\nKamla Nagar is named after [[Kamala Nehru]], a freedom fighter and wife of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first [[Prime_minister|prime minister]]. The neighbourhood rose to prominence after the erection of Ram Swarup Clock Tower on the [[Grand Trunk Road]] in 1941, and the construction of Jaipuria and Birla [[textile mills]]. It was also a stop on the erstwhile Delhi Tram Service. In the 1950s, it was developed as an affluent residential area.\n\nKamla Nagar, and its adjoining neighbourhoods, were a centre of political activity during the late [[British Raj]] and the first two decades after [[Independence]].
