This speed also appears to extend to his other individual limbs as he is able to punch at a rapid rate. Dash's increased speed also augments his practical reaction time, making his reflexes much faster than those of an ordinary human. Edna Mode designed his super suit to be resistant to air friction, wear, and heat when Dash is running at super speed.\n\n== Personality ==\nDash, as described by Helen, is a \"highly competitive boy, and a bit of a showoff\". He has a reckless and impulsive nature. Dash believes that he shouldn't be ashamed of his abilities or need to hide them, believing it makes him special. Although he bickers with his sister Violet, he shows a strong caring side when he comes to her defense against one of Syndrome's minions in the first installment.\n\n== Appearances ==\nIn the 2004 film ''[[The Incredibles]]'', Dash complains that his mother, Helen, will not allow him to play school sports, because she thinks that he would use his super-speed and blow the family's civilian cover. She is also upset when he uses his power to play a prank on his teacher, Bernie Kropp, which can also threaten their cover.\n\nAs Helen prepares to go after Dash's father, Bob, who she discovers is on a Syndrome's island, Dash and his sister, Violet, discovers the supersuits Edna Mode made for them. Donning the one made for him, Dash calls himself '''The Dash'''. He and Violet stow away on Helen's plane, and the three of them barely survive its destruction by Syndrome, Dash and Violet are left to fend for themselves in the island's jungles as Helen goes after a captured Bob. Before leaving them in a cave, Helen tells Dash that if they encounter danger, he should run as fast as he can to protect himself, the first time Dash is allowed to do so. The cave turns out to be the fiery exhaust for the flames of Syndrome's base, Dash and Violet are forced to flee the cave, and defend themselves when they are confronted by Syndrome's henchmen. This proves to be the first time Dash is able to fully explore the extent and application of his powers, which allow him to evade his pursuers, best them in fistfights, quickly generate cover by kicking up dirt, and even run on water. He and Violet also discover that when they combine his speed with her force field powers, they can create a spherical force field that can traverse water. Nonetheless, Syndrome captures all four family members. After Violet frees them, they travel back to Metro City, Dash and his family, along with Frozone, work together to defeat Syndrome's Omnidroid. A few months later, Dash's parents allow him to participate in the track & field practice, but urge him to pull back on first place, as a way to avoid using his powers too conspicuously. When the villainous Underminer emerges from beneath the ground, Dash joins his family in donning his mask in preparation to confront the criminal.\n\nIn the 2018 sequel ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', as Helen pursues the [[Screenslaver]] as part of a publicity campaign to rehabilitate the image of superheroes in the mind of the public, Bob spends more time with Dash and Violet. Bob struggles to help Dash with his math homework, in light of his lack of familiarity with how the children of Dash's generation are taught math. For his part, Dash entertains dreams of firing the rockets of his father's high-tech car, the Incredimobile. When his family is confronted at their home by a group of superheroes being mind-controlled by [[Evelyn Deavor]], Bob is captured, and Dash, Violet and their infant brother Jack-Jack escape in the Incredimobile. They travel to ''Everjust'', the yacht of Evelyn's brother, Winston, where they free the superheroes, including their parents, from Evelyn's mind control, leading to Evelyn's defeat and arrest. At the end of the film, after Dash accompanies his family in dropping off Violet and her date, Tony Rydinger, at a movie theater, the family sees a high-speed chase in progress, and once again goes into action.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nHypable ranked Dash the sixth-best ''Incredibles 2'' superhero, with author Aaron Locke writing \"Still young and learning important virtues like patience and restraint, Dash is full of potential that could make him a powerful superhero\".

He stated that ten-year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls thus conceived Dash as \"the average ten-year-old boy that can move twice as fast as anybody else\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emol.org/film/archives/incredibles/production3.html |title=The Incredibles: Movie Production Information p. 3 |website=EMOL.org |date=2005 |accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Chen, Sam |url=http://www.animationtrip.com/item.php?id=257 |title=Brad Bird's Super-Insights on The Incredibles! |website=AnimationTrip.com |date=2004 |accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe filmmakers cast rising eleven-year-old [[Spencer Fox]] who made his feature film debut in ''[[The Incredibles]]'' to voice the diminutive and mischievous son of Bob and Helen Parr.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pixartalk.com/feature-films/the-incredibles/the-incredibles-production-notes/ |title=The Incredibles \u2013 Production Notes |date=8 June 2009 |publisher=}}</ref> [[Brad Bird]] wanted to give Dash a realistic out-of-breath voice in certain scenes such as the jungle scene so he made Fox run four laps around the [[Pixar]] studio until he got tired.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trackrecord.net/the-guitarist-in-indie-band-charly-bliss-voiced-dash-in-1823016304 |title=The Guitarist in Indie Band Charly Bliss Voiced Dash in The Incredibles, So We Talked to Him About It |first=Shawn |last=Cooke |publisher=TrackRecord |date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> Due to Fox's voice maturing he was replaced by 10-year-old newcomer Huckleberry Milner in the sequel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://parade.com/674715/lhochwald/incredibles-2-the-10-most-incredible-reasons-we-love-the-parr-family/ |title=''Incredibles 2'': The 10 Most Incredible Reasons We Love the Parr Family |first=Lambeth |last=Hochwald |magazine=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |date=June 1, 2018 |accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/d23-expo-pixar-walt-disney-animation-studios-upcoming-films/ |title=D23 Expo: Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios: The Upcoming Films |date=July 14, 2017 |author=Ching, Albert |publisher=[[CBR.com]] |accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/incredibles-2-dash-new-voice-actor-recast-2018-2 |title='Incredibles 2' swapped out one of the stars in the main cast \u2013 but you probably missed it |author=Renfro, Kim |publisher=Insider |date=June 15, 2018 |accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/10-year-olds-acting-career-takes-off-with-incredibles-2/2018/06/18/610c0656-6802-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |author=Chen, Sandie Angulo |date=June 18, 2018 |title=\u2018Incredibles 2\u2019 is a super first acting job for 10-year-old |accessdate=June 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nProducer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] said of Dash in the sequel, \"Dash got a taste of life as a crime fighter in the first film.

This speed also appears to extend to his other individual limbs as he is able to punch at a rapid rate. Dash's increased speed also augments his practical reaction time, making his reflexes much faster than those of an ordinary human. Edna Mode designed his super suit to be resistant to air friction, wear, and heat when Dash is running at super speed.\n\n== Personality ==\nDash, as described by Helen, is a \"highly competitive boy, and a bit of a showoff\". He has a reckless and impulsive nature. Dash believes that he shouldn't be ashamed of his abilities or need to hide them, believing it makes him special. Although he bickers with his sister Violet, he shows a strong caring side when he comes to her defense against one of Syndrome's minions in the first installment.\n\n== Appearances ==\nIn the 2004 film ''[[The Incredibles]]'', Dash complains that his mother, Helen, will not allow him to play school sports, because she thinks that he would use his super-speed and blow the family's civilian cover. She is also upset when he uses his power to play a prank on his teacher, Bernie Kropp, which can also threaten their cover.\n\nAs Helen prepares to go after Dash's father, Bob, who she discovers is on a Syndrome's island, Dash and his sister, Violet, discovers the supersuits Edna Mode made for them. Donning the one made for him, Dash calls himself '''The Dash'''. He and Violet stow away on Helen's plane, and the three of them barely survive its destruction by Syndrome, Dash and Violet are left to fend for themselves in the island's jungles as Helen goes after a captured Bob. Before leaving them in a cave, Helen tells Dash that if they encounter danger, he should run as fast as he can to protect himself, the first time Dash is allowed to do so. The cave turns out to be the fiery exhaust for the flames of Syndrome's base, Dash and Violet are forced to flee the cave, and defend themselves when they are confronted by Syndrome's henchmen. This proves to be the first time Dash is able to fully explore the extent and application of his powers, which allow him to evade his pursuers, best them in fistfights, quickly generate cover by kicking up dirt, and even run on water. He and Violet also discover that when they combine his speed with her force field powers, they can create a spherical force field that can traverse water. Nonetheless, Syndrome captures all four family members. After Violet frees them, they travel back to Metro City, Dash and his family, along with Frozone, work together to defeat Syndrome's Omnidroid. A few months later, Dash's parents allow him to participate in the track & field practice, but urge him to pull back on first place, as a way to avoid using his powers too conspicuously. When the villainous Underminer emerges from beneath the ground, Dash joins his family in donning his mask in preparation to confront the criminal.\n\nIn the 2018 sequel ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', as Helen pursues the [[Screenslaver]] as part of a publicity campaign to rehabilitate the image of superheroes in the mind of the public, Bob spends more time with Dash and Violet. Bob struggles to help Dash with his math homework, in light of his lack of familiarity with how the children of Dash's generation are taught math. For his part, Dash entertains dreams of firing the rockets of his father's high-tech car, the Incredimobile. When his family is confronted at their home by a group of superheroes being mind-controlled by [[Evelyn Deavor]], Bob is captured, and Dash, Violet and their infant brother Jack-Jack escape in the Incredimobile. They travel to ''Everjust'', the yacht of Evelyn's brother, Winston, where they free the superheroes, including their parents, from Evelyn's mind control, leading to Evelyn's defeat and arrest. At the end of the film, after Dash accompanies his family in dropping off Violet and her date, Tony Rydinger, at a movie theater, the family sees a high-speed chase in progress, and once again goes into action.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nHypable ranked Dash the sixth-best ''Incredibles 2'' superhero, with author Aaron Locke writing \"Still young and learning important virtues like patience and restraint, Dash is full of potential that could make him a powerful superhero\".

Ryland Sanford and J. Hunt Hargrave as the Chatham Training School (CTS). In 1925, CTS was renamed to Hargrave Military Academy in honor of one of its founders J. Hunt Hargrave. The renaming of the school was part of the school's evolution into a military high school in the early twenties.<ref name=\"auto\">Fifty Years of Christian Education in a Baptist School: A Historical Record of Hargrave Military Academy, 1959</ref> Hargrave has been approved for [[JROTC]] numerous times since then, but many in the Hargrave community, most notably the Board of Trustees, feared that the addition of that program would put too much emphasis on military studies and lessen academics.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Hargrave has consistently operated independent of JROTC, however, including by utilizing its own uniforms, cadet rank structure, and [[chain of command]].\n\nOn February 20, 1950, a fire destroyed Hargrave Hall and Founders Hall. No cadets or faculty were harmed, but Sanford Hall was the only building that remained unscathed. After an assembly before Colonel Camden in the Sanford Hall auditorium, a two-week vacation was declared. This was to allow time for Hargrave staff to work out a way to continue the regular academic schedule.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe first African American cadets were admitted to Hargrave in the summer of 1971 after the Board of Trustees passed a resolution that Hargrave would not consider race, color, or country of origin in its admission or employment policy and Colonel Vernon T. Lankford signed the Civil Rights Agreement. [[Andrew Ballen]] became the first black battalion commander in 1991.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tallent|first=Mary|title=Years of Change; Years of Growth: A History of Hargrave Military Academy 1970\u20132003|year=2004|publisher=Hargrave Military Academy|location=Chatam|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Years_of_Change_Years_of_Growth.html?id=mYNlMQAACAAJ|quote=Andrew Ballen of Greensboro, North Carolina, became the first African-American to serve as Corps commander at Hargrave Military Academy.}}</ref>\n\nWith enrollment at 586 for the 1970\u20131971 year, the Hargrave Corps of Cadets was organized into two battalions lead by a Corps Commander with the rank of Cadet Colonel. Since 1971, the HMA Corps of Cadets has remained as a single battalion; its commander is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel. Female cadets were admitted for the first time in the 1975\u20131976 year, and Geri Lou Huizinga and Lynn Emerson became the first women to graduate from HMA in 1976. Hargrave transitioned back into an all Male school in the early 2000s; the last female cadets graduated in 2009.\n\nIn 1981, The General [[Douglas MacArthur]] award was presented for the first time, the first cadet to receive it being Henry A. Haymes. That same year, school officials turned down the request to film on campus by the producers of the movie [[Taps (film)|Taps]], due to disagreements with film's plot and opposition to the producers\u2019 request to erect a wall around the front of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083169/trivia|title=Taps (1981)|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nA four-week summer program began in 2009. In September, Hargrave celebrated the school's 100th founders day under the leadership of Colonel Wheeler L. Baker.\n\n===Organization===\nHargrave is governed by a Board of Trustees. Many members of the board are alumni and community leaders. Also, Hargrave has developed its own [[charitable foundation]] to allow [[philanthropists]] an opportunity to make gifts to the school.\n\n'''Presidents of HMA:'''\n* Headmaster [[Charles R.

Cadets have the opportunity to make academic honor rolls every grading period, consisting of the Dean's List and President's List. Post-Graduate students are eligible for the President's Commendation list.\n\nHargrave utilizes an \"Enhanced Learning Through Technology\" program, providing internet access in every room on campus. Cadets have the ability to work on class material, study, and contact their instructors at any time, from any place on campus.\n\nIn 2003, and 2011 Hargrave completed two upgrades to the academic space, including four laboratory areas, a new art studio, a college lecture-style learning center called the DLC (distance learning center), a \"leadership center\" and a greatly expanded video production classroom where cadets produce weekly announcement videos.

The curriculum includes an investigation of the foundations of leadership such as Leadership Traits, Leadership Principles, Leadership Styles and Ethical Behavior. During their sophomore year, Cadets begin to assume positions as small unit leaders (squad leaders) which permits practical application of the leadership principles learned in the classroom. Upon completion of this Leadership 1 course, cadets can enroll in Leadership 2, which goes into more detail on the leadership traits, principles, and techniques encouraged by General Colin Powell.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nCadets who complete the requirements of the Colin Powell Leadership Program may apply for the Colin Powell Leadership Medal; an honor only select Cadets achieve.

Ryland Sanford and J. Hunt Hargrave as the Chatham Training School (CTS). In 1925, CTS was renamed to Hargrave Military Academy in honor of one of its founders J. Hunt Hargrave. The renaming of the school was part of the school's evolution into a military high school in the early twenties.<ref name=\"auto\">Fifty Years of Christian Education in a Baptist School: A Historical Record of Hargrave Military Academy, 1959</ref> Hargrave has been approved for [[JROTC]] numerous times since then, but many in the Hargrave community, most notably the Board of Trustees, feared that the addition of that program would put too much emphasis on military studies and lessen academics.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Hargrave has consistently operated independent of JROTC, however, including by utilizing its own uniforms, cadet rank structure, and [[chain of command]].\n\nOn February 20, 1950, a fire destroyed Hargrave Hall and Founders Hall. No cadets or faculty were harmed, but Sanford Hall was the only building that remained unscathed. After an assembly before Colonel Camden in the Sanford Hall auditorium, a two-week vacation was declared. This was to allow time for Hargrave staff to work out a way to continue the regular academic schedule.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe first African American cadets were admitted to Hargrave in the summer of 1971 after the Board of Trustees passed a resolution that Hargrave would not consider race, color, or country of origin in its admission or employment policy and Colonel Vernon T. Lankford signed the Civil Rights Agreement.

Since 1971, the HMA Corps of Cadets has remained as a single battalion; its commander is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel. Female cadets were admitted for the first time in the 1975\u20131976 year, and Geri Lou Huizinga and Lynn Emerson became the first women to graduate from HMA in 1976. Hargrave transitioned back into an all Male school in the early 2000s; the last female cadets graduated in 2009.\n\nIn 1981, The General [[Douglas MacArthur]] award was presented for the first time, the first cadet to receive it being Henry A. Haymes. That same year, school officials turned down the request to film on campus by the producers of the movie [[Taps (film)|Taps]], due to disagreements with film's plot and opposition to the producers\u2019 request to erect a wall around the front of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083169/trivia|title=Taps (1981)|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nA four-week summer program began in 2009.

Through the network, Cadets can access 44 reference and research databases online, 19 reference eBooks in the virtual library, access the Atomic Learning Tutor for software programs, and access subject specific learning programs, such as Boxer Math. Hargrave also utilizes Blackboard, a class teaching program.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Colin Powell Center for Leadership & Ethics===\nHargrave Military Academy offers a General Colin Powell Center for Leadership & Ethics; that was established to provide Cadets with a challenging, progressive and structured leadership education. Hargrave Cadets are taught to lead in an academic environment and through practical application by applying learned leadership techniques in day-to-day situations.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hargrave.edu/academics/leadership-colin-powell-center-for-leadership-ethics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920170501/https://www.hargrave.edu/academics/leadership-colin-powell-center-for-leadership-ethics |archivedate=2016-09-20 }}</ref>\n\nCadets are given the opportunity to enroll in a formal Leadership and Ethics Class (a \u00bd credit class of 18 weeks in length). The curriculum includes an investigation of the foundations of leadership such as Leadership Traits, Leadership Principles, Leadership Styles and Ethical Behavior. During their sophomore year, Cadets begin to assume positions as small unit leaders (squad leaders) which permits practical application of the leadership principles learned in the classroom. Upon completion of this Leadership 1 course, cadets can enroll in Leadership 2, which goes into more detail on the leadership traits, principles, and techniques encouraged by General Colin Powell.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nCadets who complete the requirements of the Colin Powell Leadership Program may apply for the Colin Powell Leadership Medal; an honor only select Cadets achieve. If they are accepted, Cadets will earn the Colin Powell Leadership Medal, and, upon graduation, a Certificate in Leadership Studies along with their Hargrave Military Academy Diploma.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==Military structure==\nAccording to their website, \"Hargrave's military program is designed to present an environment in which a Cadet may gain a sense of humor, commitment, and fidelity. The daily exposure of a military environment assists Cadets in developing self-discipline, character, ethics, team building, and leadership.\"<ref>[http://www.hargrave.edu/faq.html www.hargrave.edu FAQ]{{dead link|date=December 2008}}</ref> Military aspects include the wearing of [[uniforms]], a military-style organization of personnel, [[military ranks|ranks]], and a [[chain of command]].<ref name=\"auto3\">\"Chain of Command: Military and Hargrave.\" Leadership Presentations.

The honor company is the company with the best overall academic and military performance. For winning, the eat first at [[mess]], and display a streamer on their [[Guidon (United States)|guidon]].\n\nThe rank structure at Hargrave is similar to that of the [[United States Army]], and includes the rank of Basic Cadet.\n\nAfter attending Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCO) School prior to the beginning of the academic year, cadets can obtain NCO ranks and positions. One cadet is appointed to the rank of Command Sergeant Major, serving on Battalion staff as the highest-ranking NCO. \n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0;\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!'''Grade'''||C-9||colspan=2|C-8||C-7||C-6||C-5||C-4||C-3||C-2||C-1\n|-\n||Insignia\n|| [[File:TAMU-09-Cadet-CSM.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-11-Cadet-1SG.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-12-Cadet-MSG.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-13-Cadet-SFC.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-14-Cadet-SSG.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-15-Cadet-SGT.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-16-Cadet-CPL.JPG|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU 17a PFC.svg|60px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-17-Cadet-PFC.JPG|60px]]\n|| ''No Insignia''\n|-\n||Title\n||[[Sergeant Major#United States|Sergeant Major]]\n||[[First Sergeant]]\n||[[Master Sergeant#United States|Master Sergeant]]\n||[[Sergeant First Class]]\n||[[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]]\n||[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]]\n||[[Corporal#United States|Corporal]]\n||[[Private First Class]]\n||[[Private (rank)|Private]]\n||Basic Cadet\n|-\n|Abbreviation||SGM||1SG||MSG||SFC||SSG||SGT||CPL||PFC||PVT||BC\n|}\n\nThe week before the start of their senior year, cadets have the option of attending [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), which allows them to obtain commissioned officer ranks. The OCS Completion Ribbon is awarded to those cadets who finish OCS. A cadet officer can hold many leadership positions ranging from auxiliary to Battalion Commander. The corps is run by the cadet officers and is supervised by the military faculty members. The Battalion Commander is the commanding officer of the corps. The Battalion XO is the second highest position in the Corps of Cadets whose primary job is to manage the Battalion Staff. The Battalion Staff is responsible for all operations throughout the Corps.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Blouse rank insignia on HMA dress uniforms is similar to those used at West Point, with large yellow and black edged stripes.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0;\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!'''Grade'''||CO-6||CO-5||CO-4||CO-3||CO-2||CO-1\n|-\n||Insignia\n|| [[File:TAMU-03-Cadet-COL.JPG|75px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-04-Cadet-LTC.JPG|50px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-05-Cadet-MAJ.JPG|25px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-06-Cadet-CPT.JPG|75px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-07-Cadet-1LT.JPG|50px]]\n|| [[File:TAMU-08-Cadet-2LT.JPG|25px]]\n|-\n||Title\n|| [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]\n|| [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]\n|| [[Major (United States)|Major]]\n|| [[Captain (United States)|Captain]]\n|| [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]\n|| [[Second Lieutenant#United States of America|Second Lieutenant]]\n|-\n||Abbreviation||COL||LTC||MAJ||CPT||1LT||2LT\n|}\n\n===Discipline===\n[[File:HARGRAVES BULLRING2.jpg|thumb|The Bullring]]\nNotable at Hargrave is the notorious Bullring, a square painted on cement in the middle of campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scout.com/college/georgia/Article/Getting-used-to-military-school-104232600|title=Getting used to military school|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref> Cadets who violate any of the rules and regulations may be sent to the Bullring to walk tours.<ref>Hargrave Military Academy Student Planner and Cadet Regulations, 2014\u20132015, p. 13-15.</ref> One hour of walking around the Bullring in uniform makes up a single tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n56Ni7WhczU|title=Hargrave Military Academy bullring|last=Blake Sivon|date=23 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>  Cadets may also be briefly subject to [[Physical fitness#PT|PT]] in the bullring for minor infractions.\n\n==Honor system==\n\nThe [[honor code]] prohibits cadets from [[Lie|lying]], [[cheating]], or [[stealing]].

Pribram''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|r|a\u026a|b|r|\u00e6|m}}; {{IPA-de|\u02c8p\u0281i\u02d0bram|lang}}; February 25, 1919 \u2013 January 19, 2015) was a professor at [[Georgetown University]], in the [[United States]], an emeritus professor of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] at [[Stanford University]] and distinguished professor at [[Radford University]]. [[American Board of Medical Specialties|Board-certified]] as a [[neurosurgeon]], Pribram did pioneering work on the definition of the [[limbic system]], the relationship of the [[frontal cortex]] to the limbic system, the sensory-specific \"association\" cortex of the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[temporal lobe]]s, and the classical [[motor cortex]] of the human [[brain]]. He worked with [[Karl Lashley]] at the [[Yerkes Primate Center]] of which he was to become director later. He was professor at [[Yale University]] for ten years and at [[Stanford University]] for thirty years.\n\nTo the general public, Pribram is best known for his development of the [[holonomic brain model]] of [[cognitive function]] and his contribution to ongoing neurological research into memory, emotion, motivation and [[consciousness]]. He was married to American author [[Katherine Neville (author)|Katherine Neville]].\n\n== Holonomic model ==\n{{main|Holonomic brain theory}}\n{{Neuropsychology}}\nPribram's holonomic model of brain processing is described in his 1991 ''Brain and Perception'', which contains the extension of his work with [[David Bohm]]. It states that, in addition to the circuitry accomplished by the large fiber tracts in the brain, processing also occurs in webs of fine fiber branches (for instance, [[dendrite]]s) that form webs, as well as in the dynamic electrical fields that surround these dendritic \"trees\". In addition, the processing occurring around these dendritic trees can influence that occurring in those trees of nearby neurons whose dendrites are entangled but not in direct contact. In this way, processing in the brain can occur in a non-localized manner. This type of processing is properly described by [[Dennis Gabor]], the inventor of hologram, as quanta of information he called a \"holon\", an energy-based concept of information. These wavelets{{clarify|date=February 2015}} are used in quantum [[holography]], the basis of MRI, PET scans and other image processing procedures {{citation needed|reason=This is misleading at best. Quantum (what other is there?) holography does not come into play with MRI or PET to my understanding.|date=February 2015}}.\n\nGabor wavelets are windowed [[Fourier transforms]] that convert complex spatial (and temporal) patterns into component waves whose amplitudes at their intersections become reinforced or diminished {{Technical-statement|date=February 2015}}. Fourier processes are the basis of holography. Holograms can\ncorrelate and store a huge amount of information - and have the advantage that the inverse transform returns the results of correlation into the spatial and temporal patterns that guide us in navigating our universe.\n\n[[David Bohm]] had suggested that were we to view the cosmos without the lenses that outfit our telescopes, the universe would appear to us as a hologram. Pribram extended this insight by noting that were we deprived of the lenses of our eyes and the lens-like processes of our other sensory receptors, we would be immersed in holographic experiences.\n\n== Other contributions ==\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Pribram's neurobehavioral experiments established the composition of the limbic system and the executive functions of the [[prefrontal cortex]]. Pribram also discovered the sensory specific systems of the [[cerebral cortex#Association areas|association cortex]], and showed that these systems operate to organize the choices we make among sensory stimuli, not the sensing of the stimuli themselves.\n\nHis account of how his discoveries were made is in his book ''The Form Within'' which was published in 2013. It includes stories of his encounters with leading scientists and scholars of the day, and amusing stories like how he lost part of a finger when his hand was slammed down by the chimpanzee [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1999, he was the inaugural winner of the Dagmar and V\u00e1clav Havel Award for uniting the sciences and the humanities.

Pribram''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|r|a\u026a|b|r|\u00e6|m}}; {{IPA-de|\u02c8p\u0281i\u02d0bram|lang}}; February 25, 1919 \u2013 January 19, 2015) was a professor at [[Georgetown University]], in the [[United States]], an emeritus professor of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]] at [[Stanford University]] and distinguished professor at [[Radford University]]. [[American Board of Medical Specialties|Board-certified]] as a [[neurosurgeon]], Pribram did pioneering work on the definition of the [[limbic system]], the relationship of the [[frontal cortex]] to the limbic system, the sensory-specific \"association\" cortex of the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[temporal lobe]]s, and the classical [[motor cortex]] of the human [[brain]]. He worked with [[Karl Lashley]] at the [[Yerkes Primate Center]] of which he was to become director later. He was professor at [[Yale University]] for ten years and at [[Stanford University]] for thirty years.\n\nTo the general public, Pribram is best known for his development of the [[holonomic brain model]] of [[cognitive function]] and his contribution to ongoing neurological research into memory, emotion, motivation and [[consciousness]]. He was married to American author [[Katherine Neville (author)|Katherine Neville]].\n\n== Holonomic model ==\n{{main|Holonomic brain theory}}\n{{Neuropsychology}}\nPribram's holonomic model of brain processing is described in his 1991 ''Brain and Perception'', which contains the extension of his work with [[David Bohm]]. It states that, in addition to the circuitry accomplished by the large fiber tracts in the brain, processing also occurs in webs of fine fiber branches (for instance, [[dendrite]]s) that form webs, as well as in the dynamic electrical fields that surround these dendritic \"trees\". In addition, the processing occurring around these dendritic trees can influence that occurring in those trees of nearby neurons whose dendrites are entangled but not in direct contact. In this way, processing in the brain can occur in a non-localized manner. This type of processing is properly described by [[Dennis Gabor]], the inventor of hologram, as quanta of information he called a \"holon\", an energy-based concept of information. These wavelets{{clarify|date=February 2015}} are used in quantum [[holography]], the basis of MRI, PET scans and other image processing procedures {{citation needed|reason=This is misleading at best. Quantum (what other is there?) holography does not come into play with MRI or PET to my understanding.|date=February 2015}}.\n\nGabor wavelets are windowed [[Fourier transforms]] that convert complex spatial (and temporal) patterns into component waves whose amplitudes at their intersections become reinforced or diminished {{Technical-statement|date=February 2015}}. Fourier processes are the basis of holography. Holograms can\ncorrelate and store a huge amount of information - and have the advantage that the inverse transform returns the results of correlation into the spatial and temporal patterns that guide us in navigating our universe.\n\n[[David Bohm]] had suggested that were we to view the cosmos without the lenses that outfit our telescopes, the universe would appear to us as a hologram. Pribram extended this insight by noting that were we deprived of the lenses of our eyes and the lens-like processes of our other sensory receptors, we would be immersed in holographic experiences.\n\n== Other contributions ==\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Pribram's neurobehavioral experiments established the composition of the limbic system and the executive functions of the [[prefrontal cortex]]. Pribram also discovered the sensory specific systems of the [[cerebral cortex#Association areas|association cortex]], and showed that these systems operate to organize the choices we make among sensory stimuli, not the sensing of the stimuli themselves.\n\nHis account of how his discoveries were made is in his book ''The Form Within'' which was published in 2013. It includes stories of his encounters with leading scientists and scholars of the day, and amusing stories like how he lost part of a finger when his hand was slammed down by the chimpanzee [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1999, he was the inaugural winner of the Dagmar and V\u00e1clav Havel Award for uniting the sciences and the humanities. He died in 2015 in [[Virginia]], aged 95.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karlpribram.com/karl-pribram-1919-2015/|title=Karl Pribram 1919-2015 \u00ab  Karl Pribram|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book| last =Miller| first =George| author2 =[[Eugene Galanter|Galanter, Eugene]]| author3 =Pribram, Karl| title =Plans and the structure of behavior| publisher =[[Henry Holt and Company|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]| year =1960| location =[[New York City|New York]]| isbn =0-03-010075-5| url =https://archive.org/details/plansstructureo00mill}}\n* DeVore, Steven; Pribram, Karl (1985)  ''[http://www.sybervision.com/Achievement.com/index.html The Neuropsychology of Achievement.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' Pleasanton, CA, SyberVision Systems.
