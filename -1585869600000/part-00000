'approximately' is properly used only in citing a date which is not known exactly, and then usually only if the date is given in parentheses: --> September 16, 1984) was an American novelist, poet, and short story writer. His work often clinically and surrealistically employs [[black comedy]], [[parody]], and satire, with [[Reduced affect display|emotionally blunt]] prose describing pastoral American life intertwining with technological progress. He is best known for his novels ''[[Trout Fishing in America]]'' (1967) and ''[[In Watermelon Sugar]]'' (1968).\n\nBrautigan began his career as a poet, with his first collection being published in 1957. He made his debut as a novelist with ''[[A Confederate General from Big Sur]]'' (1964), about a seemingly delusional man who believes himself to be the descendant of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general. Brautigan would go on to publish numerous prose and poetry collections until 1982. He committed suicide in 1984.\n\n==Early life==\n===Background===\nBrautigan was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], the only child of Bernard Frederick \"Ben\" Brautigan Jr. (July 29, 1908 \u2013 May 27, 1994), a factory worker and laborer, and Lulu Mary \"Mary Lou\" Keho (April 7, 1911 \u2013 September 24, 2005), a waitress. In May 1934, eight months before Richard's birth, Bernard and Mary Lou separated. Brautigan said that he met his biological father only twice, although after Richard's death, Bernard was said to be unaware that Richard was his child, saying \"He's got the same last name, but why would they wait 45 to 50 years to tell me I've got a son?\"<ref>\"[http://www.brautigan.net/obituaries.html#bernard2 Brautigan.]\" UPI News. October 27, 1984.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Brautigan and his mother began living with a man named Arthur Martin Titland. The couple produced a daughter named Barbara Ann, born on May 1, 1939, in Tacoma. Brautigan claimed that he had a very traumatic experience when, at age six, his mother left him and his two-year-old sister unattended in a motel room in [[Great Falls, Montana]], for two days.\n\nOn January 20, 1943, Mary Lou married a fry cook named Robert Geoffrey Porterfield. The couple had a daughter named Sandra Jean, born April 1, 1945, at Salem General Hospital in Salem, Oregon.<ref name=jubilee/> Mary Lou told Brautigan that Porterfield was his biological father, and Brautigan began using ''Richard Gary Porterfield'' as his name. Mary Lou separated from Porterfield in 1946, and married William David Folston Sr. on June 12, 1950. The couple produced a son named William David Jr., born on December 19, 1950, in Eugene. Folston was recalled as being a violent alcoholic, whom Richard had seen [[domestic abuse|abusing]] his mother.\n\nBrautigan was raised in poverty; he told his daughter stories of his mother sifting rat feces out of their supply of flour before making flour-and-water pancakes.<ref name=\"Ianthe\">Brautigan, Ianthe: ''You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir.'' St. Martin's Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-84195-025-4}}.</ref> Brautigan's family found it difficult to obtain food, and on some occasions they did not eat for days. The family lived on [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and moved about the [[Pacific Northwest]] for nine years before settling in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in August 1944. Many of Brautigan's childhood experiences are included in the poems and stories that he wrote from as early as the age of 12. His novel ''[[So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away]]'' is loosely based on childhood experiences, including an incident in which Brautigan accidentally shot the brother of a close friend in the ear, injuring him only slightly.\n\nOn September 12, 1950, Brautigan enrolled at [[Eugene High School]], having graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson Junior High School (Eugene, Oregon)|Woodrow Wilson Junior High School]]. He wrote for his high school newspaper, the ''Eugene High School News''. He also played on his school's basketball team, and stood {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} tall by the time of his graduation. On December 19, 1952, Brautigan's first published poem, \"The Light\", appeared in the school newspaper. Brautigan graduated with honors from Eugene High School on June 9, 1953. After graduation, he moved in with his best friend Peter Webster, and Peter's mother Edna Webster became a surrogate mother to Brautigan. According to several accounts, Brautigan stayed with Webster for about a year before leaving for San Francisco for the first time in August 1954. He returned to Oregon several times, apparently for lack of money.<ref name=BrautBio>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/biography.html|title=Biography|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn December 14, 1955, Brautigan was arrested for throwing a rock through a police station window, supposedly to be sent to prison and fed. He was arrested for [[disorderly conduct]] and fined $25. He was then committed to the [[Oregon State Hospital]] on December 24, 1955, after police noticed patterns of erratic behavior.\n\nAt the Oregon State Hospital Brautigan was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and clinical depression, and was treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] 12 times.<ref>Enzinna, Wes, \"Man Underwater\", ''Harper's Magazine''. December 2012: 76\u201380.</ref> While institutionalized, he began writing ''The God of the Martians'', a manuscript of 20 very short chapters totaling 600 words.

On February 19, 1956, Brautigan was released from the hospital and briefly lived with his mother, stepfather, and siblings in Eugene. He then left for San Francisco, where he would spend most of the rest of his life except for periods in Tokyo and [[Montana]].<ref name=BrautBio/><ref name=brautigan>{{cite book|title=Richard Brautigan: Essays on the Writings and Life|first=John F.|last=Barber|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=McFarland & Co.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7864-2525-9|pages=25, 99, 225, 253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsXuel52NFsC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=montana+richard+brautigan#v=onepage&q=montana%20&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn San Francisco, Brautigan sought to establish himself as a writer. He was known for handing out his poetry on the streets and performing at poetry clubs. In early 1956, Brautigan typed a three-page manuscript and sent it to [[The Macmillan Company]] for publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/speciality.html |title=Richard Brautigan: Speciality Publications of His Writings |publisher=Brautigan.net |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> The manuscript consisted of two pages with 14 poems and a page with the dedication \"for Linda\". Of the poems, only \"stars\" and \"hey\" were titled. In a letter dated May 10, 1956, Macmillan rejected the manuscript, stating, \"... there is no place where it will fit in\". In 2005, the X-Ray Book Company published the manuscript as a [[chapbook]] titled ''Desire in a Bowl of Potatoes''.\n\nBrautigan's first poetry book publication was ''[[The Return of the Rivers]]'' (1957),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/rivers.html |title=Richard Brautigan: The Return of the Rivers |publisher=Brautigan.net |date=September 11, 1957 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> a single poem, followed by two collections of poetry: ''[[The Galilee Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1958) and ''[[Lay the Marble Tea]]'' (1959). During the 1960s Brautigan became involved in the burgeoning San Francisco [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture scene]], often appearing as a performance poet at concerts and participating in the various activities of [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]. He contributed several short pieces to be used as broadsides by the Communication Company. Brautigan was also a writer for  ''Change'', an [[underground newspaper]] created by [[Ron Loewinsohn]].\n\nIn the summer of 1961, while camping in southern Idaho with his wife and daughter, Brautigan completed the novels ''[[A Confederate General From Big Sur]]'' and ''[[Trout Fishing in America]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/trout.html|title=Richard Brautigan: Trout Fishing in America|website=brautigan.net|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>[[Little Redfish Lake]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}} ''A Confederate General from Big Sur'' was his first published novel and met with little critical or commercial success. But when  ''Trout Fishing in America'' was published in 1967, Brautigan was catapulted to international fame. Literary critics labeled him the writer most representative of the emerging countercultural youth movement of the late 1960s, even though he was said to be contemptuous of [[hippies]].<ref name=BrautMemoirs>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/memoirs.html#wright|title=Memoirs|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref> ''Trout Fishing in America'' has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1960s Brautigan published four collections of poetry as well as another novel, ''[[In Watermelon Sugar]]'' (1968). In the spring of 1967 he was Poet-in-Residence at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. During this year, he published ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (collection)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', a chapbook published by The Communication Company.

From 1968 to 1970 Brautigan had 23 short pieces published in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.<ref>[http://brautigan.cybernetic-meadows.net/tiki-index.php?page=Rolling%20Stone ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001091828/http://brautigan.cybernetic-meadows.net/tiki-index.php?page=Rolling%20Stone |date=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> From late 1968 to February 1969, Brautigan recorded a spoken-word album for [[The Beatles]]' short-lived record-label, [[Zapple]]. The label was shut down by [[Allen Klein]] before the recording could be released, but it was eventually released in 1970 on [[Harvest Records]] as ''Listening to Richard Brautigan''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/recordings.html#listening|title=Recordings|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s Brautigan experimented with literary genres. He published five novels (the first of which, ''[[The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966]]'', had been written in the mid-1960s) and a collection of short stories, ''[[Revenge of the Lawn]]'' (1971). In 1974 The Cowell Press collected seven of his broadside poems into the book ''Seven Watermelon Suns''. The limited edition of ten copies included embossed color etchings by Ellen Meske.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21guitars.com/documents/brautigan.html |title=Richard Brautigan |publisher=21guitars.com |date=January 30, 1935 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> \"When the 1960s ended, he was the [[Throw out the baby with the bath water|baby thrown out with the bath water]],\" said his friend and fellow writer, [[Thomas McGuane]]. \"He was a gentle, troubled, deeply odd guy.\" Generally dismissed by literary critics and increasingly abandoned by his readers, Brautigan's popularity waned throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. His work remained popular in Europe, however, as well as in Japan, where Brautigan visited several times.<ref name=Braut70>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/chronology1970.html|title=Biography: 1970s|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref> To his critics, Brautigan was willfully naive. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] said of him, \"As an editor I was always waiting for Richard to grow up as a writer. It seems to me he was essentially a na\u00eff, and I don't think he cultivated that childishness, I think it came naturally. It was like he was much more in tune with the trout in America than with people.\"<ref name=Manso>Manso, Peter; McClure, Michael. \"Brautigan's Wake.\" ''Vanity Fair'', May 1985: 62\u201368, 112\u2013116.</ref>\n\nBrautigan's writings are characterized by a remarkable and humorous imagination. The permeation of inventive metaphors lent even his prose works the feeling of poetry. Evident also are themes of [[Zen]] Buddhism like the duality of the past and the future and the impermanence of the present. Zen Buddhism and elements of the Japanese culture can be found in his novel ''Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel''. Brautigan's last publication before his death in 1984 was his novel ''[[So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away]]'', published in 1982.\n\n''The Edna Webster Collection of Undiscovered Writings'' was published in 1999. This collection of writings was gifted by a twenty-one year old Richard Brautigan to Edna Webster in 1955, when he left Oregon for San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Edna Webster collection of undiscovered writings|last=Richard.|first=Brautigan|date=1999|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Webster, Edna.|isbn=0395974690|location=Boston|oclc=41412011|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ednawebstercolle0000brau}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a proposed edition of Brautigan's collected poems was rejected by his estate.<ref>''Richard Brautigan: Essays on the Writings and Life'' (McFarland, 2007), p. 188.</ref> In November 2016 the French publisher Le Castor Astral published a bilingual edition entitled ''Tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer: \u0153uvre po\u00e9tique compl\u00e8te.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castorastral.com/livre/cest-jai-a-declarer/|title=C'est tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer|website=castorastral.com|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 8, 1957, Brautigan married Virginia Dionne Alder in [[Reno, Nevada]]. The couple had one daughter together, [[Ianthe Elizabeth Brautigan]], born on March 25, 1960, in San Francisco. Brautigan's alcoholism and depression caused him to become increasingly abusive<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2009/12/25/virginia-aste/|title=\"Freedom?\": Richard Brautigan's first wife, VIRGINIA ASTE, speaks in a new interview|date=December 26, 2009|website=arthurmag.com|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref> and Alder ended the relationship on December 24, 1962, though the divorce was not finalized until July 28, 1970. Brautigan continued to reside in San Francisco after the separation, while Alder settled in [[Manoa, Hawaii]], and became a [[feminism|feminist]] and an [[opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] activist.\n\nBrautigan remarried on December 1, 1977, to the Japanese-born Akiko Yoshimura, whom he met in July 1976 while living in Tokyo. The couple settled in Pine Creek, [[Park County, Montana]], for two years. Brautigan and Yoshimura were divorced in 1980.\n\nBrautigan had a relationship with a San Francisco woman named Marcia Clay from 1981 to 1982. He also pursued a brief relationship with Janice Meissner, a woman from the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] community of San Francisco. Other relationships were with Marcia Pacaud, who appears on the cover of ''[[The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster]]''; Valerie Estes, who appears on the cover of ''Listening to Richard Brautigan''; and Sherry Vetter, who appears on the cover of ''Revenge of the Lawn''.\n\nBrautigan was an alcoholic throughout his adult life and suffered years of despair; according to his daughter, he often mentioned suicide over a period of more than a decade before ending his life.<ref name=\"Ianthe\"/>\n\nIn 1984, at age 49, Richard Brautigan had moved to [[Bolinas, California]], where he was living alone in a large, old house that he had bought with his earnings years earlier. He died of a self-inflicted [[.44 Magnum]] gunshot wound to the head. His decomposed body was found by Robert Yench, a friend and private investigator, on October 25, 1984. The body was found on the living room floor, in front of a large window that, though shrouded by trees, looked out over the Pacific Ocean. Due to the decomposition of the body it is speculated that Brautigan had ended his life over a month earlier, on September 16, 1984, days after talking to friend Marcia Clay on the telephone (neighbors heard a loud noise that Sunday while watching an NFL game<ref name=jubilee>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Counterpoint\n| isbn = 978-1-58243-790-3\n| last = Hjortsberg\n| first = William\n| authorlink = William Hjortsberg\n| title = Jubilee Hitchhiker: The Life and Times of Richard Brautigan\n| year = 2012\n}}</ref>). Brautigan was survived by his parents, both ex-wives, and his daughter Ianthe. \n\nAccording to Michael Caines, writing in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the story that Brautigan left a suicide note that simply read: \"Messy, isn't it?\" is apocryphal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suicide \u2013 The Ultimate Choice|url=http://siliclone.tripod.com/books/elvis/E061.html|work=Scot & Silicone}}</ref> Ianthe Brautigan has confirmed that her father did not leave such a message.<ref>Caines, Michael.

Writing in 1972, Long Island University professor Terrence Malley points out that \"Brautigan's books are for the most part both directly autobiographical and curiously elusive . . . It's usually difficult to separate confession from whimsy in Brautigan's writing\" (18).<ref>Malley, Terence. Richard Brautigan. Writers for the Seventies.

'approximately' is properly used only in citing a date which is not known exactly, and then usually only if the date is given in parentheses: --> September 16, 1984) was an American novelist, poet, and short story writer. His work often clinically and surrealistically employs [[black comedy]], [[parody]], and satire, with [[Reduced affect display|emotionally blunt]] prose describing pastoral American life intertwining with technological progress. He is best known for his novels ''[[Trout Fishing in America]]'' (1967) and ''[[In Watermelon Sugar]]'' (1968).\n\nBrautigan began his career as a poet, with his first collection being published in 1957. He made his debut as a novelist with ''[[A Confederate General from Big Sur]]'' (1964), about a seemingly delusional man who believes himself to be the descendant of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general. Brautigan would go on to publish numerous prose and poetry collections until 1982. He committed suicide in 1984.\n\n==Early life==\n===Background===\nBrautigan was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], the only child of Bernard Frederick \"Ben\" Brautigan Jr. (July 29, 1908 \u2013 May 27, 1994), a factory worker and laborer, and Lulu Mary \"Mary Lou\" Keho (April 7, 1911 \u2013 September 24, 2005), a waitress. In May 1934, eight months before Richard's birth, Bernard and Mary Lou separated. Brautigan said that he met his biological father only twice, although after Richard's death, Bernard was said to be unaware that Richard was his child, saying \"He's got the same last name, but why would they wait 45 to 50 years to tell me I've got a son?\"<ref>\"[http://www.brautigan.net/obituaries.html#bernard2 Brautigan.]\" UPI News. October 27, 1984.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Brautigan and his mother began living with a man named Arthur Martin Titland. The couple produced a daughter named Barbara Ann, born on May 1, 1939, in Tacoma. Brautigan claimed that he had a very traumatic experience when, at age six, his mother left him and his two-year-old sister unattended in a motel room in [[Great Falls, Montana]], for two days.\n\nOn January 20, 1943, Mary Lou married a fry cook named Robert Geoffrey Porterfield. The couple had a daughter named Sandra Jean, born April 1, 1945, at Salem General Hospital in Salem, Oregon.<ref name=jubilee/> Mary Lou told Brautigan that Porterfield was his biological father, and Brautigan began using ''Richard Gary Porterfield'' as his name. Mary Lou separated from Porterfield in 1946, and married William David Folston Sr. on June 12, 1950. The couple produced a son named William David Jr., born on December 19, 1950, in Eugene. Folston was recalled as being a violent alcoholic, whom Richard had seen [[domestic abuse|abusing]] his mother.\n\nBrautigan was raised in poverty; he told his daughter stories of his mother sifting rat feces out of their supply of flour before making flour-and-water pancakes.<ref name=\"Ianthe\">Brautigan, Ianthe: ''You Can't Catch Death: A Daughter's Memoir.'' St. Martin's Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-84195-025-4}}.</ref> Brautigan's family found it difficult to obtain food, and on some occasions they did not eat for days. The family lived on [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] and moved about the [[Pacific Northwest]] for nine years before settling in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in August 1944. Many of Brautigan's childhood experiences are included in the poems and stories that he wrote from as early as the age of 12. His novel ''[[So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away]]'' is loosely based on childhood experiences, including an incident in which Brautigan accidentally shot the brother of a close friend in the ear, injuring him only slightly.\n\nOn September 12, 1950, Brautigan enrolled at [[Eugene High School]], having graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson Junior High School (Eugene, Oregon)|Woodrow Wilson Junior High School]]. He wrote for his high school newspaper, the ''Eugene High School News''. He also played on his school's basketball team, and stood {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} tall by the time of his graduation. On December 19, 1952, Brautigan's first published poem, \"The Light\", appeared in the school newspaper. Brautigan graduated with honors from Eugene High School on June 9, 1953. After graduation, he moved in with his best friend Peter Webster, and Peter's mother Edna Webster became a surrogate mother to Brautigan. According to several accounts, Brautigan stayed with Webster for about a year before leaving for San Francisco for the first time in August 1954.

He was known for handing out his poetry on the streets and performing at poetry clubs. In early 1956, Brautigan typed a three-page manuscript and sent it to [[The Macmillan Company]] for publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/speciality.html |title=Richard Brautigan: Speciality Publications of His Writings |publisher=Brautigan.net |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> The manuscript consisted of two pages with 14 poems and a page with the dedication \"for Linda\". Of the poems, only \"stars\" and \"hey\" were titled. In a letter dated May 10, 1956, Macmillan rejected the manuscript, stating, \"... there is no place where it will fit in\". In 2005, the X-Ray Book Company published the manuscript as a [[chapbook]] titled ''Desire in a Bowl of Potatoes''.\n\nBrautigan's first poetry book publication was ''[[The Return of the Rivers]]'' (1957),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/rivers.html |title=Richard Brautigan: The Return of the Rivers |publisher=Brautigan.net |date=September 11, 1957 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> a single poem, followed by two collections of poetry: ''[[The Galilee Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1958) and ''[[Lay the Marble Tea]]'' (1959). During the 1960s Brautigan became involved in the burgeoning San Francisco [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture scene]], often appearing as a performance poet at concerts and participating in the various activities of [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]. He contributed several short pieces to be used as broadsides by the Communication Company. Brautigan was also a writer for  ''Change'', an [[underground newspaper]] created by [[Ron Loewinsohn]].\n\nIn the summer of 1961, while camping in southern Idaho with his wife and daughter, Brautigan completed the novels ''[[A Confederate General From Big Sur]]'' and ''[[Trout Fishing in America]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/trout.html|title=Richard Brautigan: Trout Fishing in America|website=brautigan.net|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>[[Little Redfish Lake]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}} ''A Confederate General from Big Sur'' was his first published novel and met with little critical or commercial success. But when  ''Trout Fishing in America'' was published in 1967, Brautigan was catapulted to international fame. Literary critics labeled him the writer most representative of the emerging countercultural youth movement of the late 1960s, even though he was said to be contemptuous of [[hippies]].<ref name=BrautMemoirs>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/memoirs.html#wright|title=Memoirs|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref> ''Trout Fishing in America'' has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1960s Brautigan published four collections of poetry as well as another novel, ''[[In Watermelon Sugar]]'' (1968). In the spring of 1967 he was Poet-in-Residence at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. During this year, he published ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (collection)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', a chapbook published by The Communication Company. It was printed in an edition of 1,500 copies and distributed free. From 1968 to 1970 Brautigan had 23 short pieces published in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.<ref>[http://brautigan.cybernetic-meadows.net/tiki-index.php?page=Rolling%20Stone ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001091828/http://brautigan.cybernetic-meadows.net/tiki-index.php?page=Rolling%20Stone |date=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> From late 1968 to February 1969, Brautigan recorded a spoken-word album for [[The Beatles]]' short-lived record-label, [[Zapple]]. The label was shut down by [[Allen Klein]] before the recording could be released, but it was eventually released in 1970 on [[Harvest Records]] as ''Listening to Richard Brautigan''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/recordings.html#listening|title=Recordings|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s Brautigan experimented with literary genres. He published five novels (the first of which, ''[[The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966]]'', had been written in the mid-1960s) and a collection of short stories, ''[[Revenge of the Lawn]]'' (1971). In 1974 The Cowell Press collected seven of his broadside poems into the book ''Seven Watermelon Suns''. The limited edition of ten copies included embossed color etchings by Ellen Meske.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21guitars.com/documents/brautigan.html |title=Richard Brautigan |publisher=21guitars.com |date=January 30, 1935 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> \"When the 1960s ended, he was the [[Throw out the baby with the bath water|baby thrown out with the bath water]],\" said his friend and fellow writer, [[Thomas McGuane]]. \"He was a gentle, troubled, deeply odd guy.\" Generally dismissed by literary critics and increasingly abandoned by his readers, Brautigan's popularity waned throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. His work remained popular in Europe, however, as well as in Japan, where Brautigan visited several times.<ref name=Braut70>{{cite web|url=http://www.brautigan.net/chronology1970.html|title=Biography: 1970s|work=Brautigan Bibliography and Archive|author=Barber, John F.|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref> To his critics, Brautigan was willfully naive. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] said of him, \"As an editor I was always waiting for Richard to grow up as a writer. It seems to me he was essentially a na\u00eff, and I don't think he cultivated that childishness, I think it came naturally. It was like he was much more in tune with the trout in America than with people.\"<ref name=Manso>Manso, Peter; McClure, Michael. \"Brautigan's Wake.\" ''Vanity Fair'', May 1985: 62\u201368, 112\u2013116.</ref>\n\nBrautigan's writings are characterized by a remarkable and humorous imagination. The permeation of inventive metaphors lent even his prose works the feeling of poetry. Evident also are themes of [[Zen]] Buddhism like the duality of the past and the future and the impermanence of the present. Zen Buddhism and elements of the Japanese culture can be found in his novel ''Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel''. Brautigan's last publication before his death in 1984 was his novel ''[[So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away]]'', published in 1982.\n\n''The Edna Webster Collection of Undiscovered Writings'' was published in 1999. This collection of writings was gifted by a twenty-one year old Richard Brautigan to Edna Webster in 1955, when he left Oregon for San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Edna Webster collection of undiscovered writings|last=Richard.|first=Brautigan|date=1999|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Webster, Edna.|isbn=0395974690|location=Boston|oclc=41412011|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ednawebstercolle0000brau}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a proposed edition of Brautigan's collected poems was rejected by his estate.<ref>''Richard Brautigan: Essays on the Writings and Life'' (McFarland, 2007), p. 188.</ref> In November 2016 the French publisher Le Castor Astral published a bilingual edition entitled ''Tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer: \u0153uvre po\u00e9tique compl\u00e8te.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castorastral.com/livre/cest-jai-a-declarer/|title=C'est tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer|website=castorastral.com|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 8, 1957, Brautigan married Virginia Dionne Alder in [[Reno, Nevada]]. The couple had one daughter together, [[Ianthe Elizabeth Brautigan]], born on March 25, 1960, in San Francisco. Brautigan's alcoholism and depression caused him to become increasingly abusive<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2009/12/25/virginia-aste/|title=\"Freedom?\": Richard Brautigan's first wife, VIRGINIA ASTE, speaks in a new interview|date=December 26, 2009|website=arthurmag.com|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref> and Alder ended the relationship on December 24, 1962, though the divorce was not finalized until July 28, 1970. Brautigan continued to reside in San Francisco after the separation, while Alder settled in [[Manoa, Hawaii]], and became a [[feminism|feminist]] and an [[opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] activist.\n\nBrautigan remarried on December 1, 1977, to the Japanese-born Akiko Yoshimura, whom he met in July 1976 while living in Tokyo. The couple settled in Pine Creek, [[Park County, Montana]], for two years. Brautigan and Yoshimura were divorced in 1980.\n\nBrautigan had a relationship with a San Francisco woman named Marcia Clay from 1981 to 1982. He also pursued a brief relationship with Janice Meissner, a woman from the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] community of San Francisco. Other relationships were with Marcia Pacaud, who appears on the cover of ''[[The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster]]''; Valerie Estes, who appears on the cover of ''Listening to Richard Brautigan''; and Sherry Vetter, who appears on the cover of ''Revenge of the Lawn''.\n\nBrautigan was an alcoholic throughout his adult life and suffered years of despair; according to his daughter, he often mentioned suicide over a period of more than a decade before ending his life.<ref name=\"Ianthe\"/>\n\nIn 1984, at age 49, Richard Brautigan had moved to [[Bolinas, California]], where he was living alone in a large, old house that he had bought with his earnings years earlier. He died of a self-inflicted [[.44 Magnum]] gunshot wound to the head. His decomposed body was found by Robert Yench, a friend and private investigator, on October 25, 1984. The body was found on the living room floor, in front of a large window that, though shrouded by trees, looked out over the Pacific Ocean. Due to the decomposition of the body it is speculated that Brautigan had ended his life over a month earlier, on September 16, 1984, days after talking to friend Marcia Clay on the telephone (neighbors heard a loud noise that Sunday while watching an NFL game<ref name=jubilee>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Counterpoint\n| isbn = 978-1-58243-790-3\n| last = Hjortsberg\n| first = William\n| authorlink = William Hjortsberg\n| title = Jubilee Hitchhiker: The Life and Times of Richard Brautigan\n| year = 2012\n}}</ref>). Brautigan was survived by his parents, both ex-wives, and his daughter Ianthe. He has one grandchild, Elizabeth, who was born about two years after his death.\n\nAccording to Michael Caines, writing in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', the story that Brautigan left a suicide note that simply read: \"Messy, isn't it?\" is apocryphal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suicide \u2013 The Ultimate Choice|url=http://siliclone.tripod.com/books/elvis/E061.html|work=Scot & Silicone}}</ref> Ianthe Brautigan has confirmed that her father did not leave such a message.<ref>Caines, Michael.

Writing in 1972, Long Island University professor Terrence Malley points out that \"Brautigan's books are for the most part both directly autobiographical and curiously elusive . . . It's usually difficult to separate confession from whimsy in Brautigan's writing\" (18).<ref>Malley, Terence. Richard Brautigan. Writers for the Seventies.

{"title_page": "Polyglot persistence", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2015}}\n{{lead rewrite|date=March 2016}}\n}}\n\n'''Polyglot persistence''' is the concept of using different data storage technologies to handle different data storage needs within a given enterprise and even software application.

The people killed were working at the scene of a train crash in Toowoomba kills six people working at the scene of an earlier derailment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towoomba Train Crash|url=http://www.ema.gov.au/ema/emadisasters.nsf/c85916e930b93d50ca256d050020cb1f/1d520f235cff8db3ca256d33000583a2?OpenDocument|publisher=The EMA database cited actually cites a Daily Telegraph list of accidents|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are varying reports of two rail accidents in (near) Toowoomba in 1913. These come from lists of major accidents compiled by some newspapers in the 21st Century. One claimed accident is for 1 January 1913 where it is claimed six persons were killed. The other is for the '''30 January 1913 where it is claimed 14 persons were killed'''. The only reasonably cited reference is to an accident at Murphys Creek (near Toowoomba) on the '''30 January 1913''' (see entry below) where '''six people are reported as being killed'''. There is no verifiable citation for fourteen people being killed in an accident near Toowoomba in 1913.\n\n===Murphys Creek, 1913===\nOn the '''30 January 1913''' '''six people were killed'''.\n\nA goods train had left Toowoomba on the night of 29 January 1913, and had derailed near the [[Murphys Creek railway station]] on the [[Main Line railway, Queensland|Main line]], about one mile from the station yard limits, on the range side near the 84-mile (139&nbsp;km) mark. No members of the crew were injured, but a considerable amount of damage was caused to the goods vehicles and the track. A breakdown gang was sent from Toowoomba and breakdown trains were also despatched from Brisbane and Toowoomba to clear wreckage from the line. The spot where the derailment had taken place was in a relatively inaccessible area and workers had to prise the wreckage apart. Several trips were made by breakdown trains to the derailment site.\n\nAt 9:35 am on 30 January, a special train left Holmes to collect passengers from the 6:30 am Brisbane train and the Sydney mail train (departed Brisbane 7:50 am). The relief special consisted of nine empty coaches, two covered wagons, and two C16 Class engines attached to the front and rear of the train. On the first part of the journey down the range, the train was under control. Mr Hallam said a guard rode on the leading engine to advise the crew of the location of the derailed stock train. The guard and fireman on the lead engine saw a glimpse of the wrecked train through the trees. However, no warning devices (detonators, or red flags) had been deployed to warn the approaching train of the breakdown train's position. The only indication was a warning which was shouted from about 70 metres from the breakdown van by a workman on the line. The driver of the relief special had made several air brake applications on the way down without recharging brake reservoirs. The driver then made an \"injudicious\" application of the Westinghouse brake and was unable to stop his train. The engine propelled by 226 tons (230 tonnes) of combined weight behind its tender collided with the rear of the breakdown train.\n\nThe breakdown van, engine and tender were all driven forward 3.5 metres. The engine collided with an \"H\" wagon that was being re-railed which, in turn, was driven forward into another five goods wagons. Members of the rescue gang, who had been working on the \"H\" wagon, were crushed beneath the wreckage. An additional breakdown train was sent to the crash site from Toowoomba at 10:00 am. Fifty workers dug frantically in the wreckage to free trapped workers, however '''six had died''' due to horrific injuries received in the collision.\n\nThe driver was found to not have approached the scene of the derailment with \"the caution demanded of him\", according to the initial departmental inquiry, and that the guard of the breakdown train had failed to adequately protect the rear of it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rail disaster|url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2009/02/23/rail-disaster-comes-to-light-with-pictures/|publisher=The Chronicle (2009)|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Humphrey, 1918===\nOn 1 June 1918 one man was killed and two women were seriously injured following this collision between a cattle train and a mixed goods on 1 June 1918 at Humphrey station, 20.2&nbsp;km from [[Mungar Junction to Monto Branch Railway|Mundubbera]].

The engine and tender derailed on a sharp curve and hit a rock wall, the engine falling on its side, causing the boiler to burst and the firebox to be torn open. The driver and fireman, Thomas Patrick Duignan, 27, and Evan William Whiting, 22, were thrown clear but suffered severe injuries and extensive burns. The guard, James Foley, also received serious injuries. The injured men were evacuated by trolley to Redlynch and then taken on a breakdown train to the Cairns District Hospital. Whiting and Duignan survived long enough the reach the hospital but died soon afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|title=A runaway engine.

Ten people were killed and 48 injured when a passenger car and the luggage van plunged off the bridge, and another passenger car was pulled on its side.

The tender of the \"B18\u00bc\" telescoped into the loco, and the following ballast waggons were piled up on top of it. Wagons further back derailed and rolled down an embankment, ripping up line and sleepers. The driver of the \"B18\u00bc\" ballast train was injured and died at the scene. The smash caused long delays for regular Townsville and Rockhampton trains bound for Brisbane in the days following the accident before the line was repaired. The two engines were written off at a cost of \u00a3100,000 (1944 values = $200,000).<ref>{{cite web|title=Marrawing Train Accident|url=http://www.ema.gov.au/ema/emadisasters.nsf/c85916e930b93d50ca256d050020cb1f/3f8807b2e6f78a43ca256d33000581ea?OpenDocument|publisher=EMA Disasters Database|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\nBoth locomotives, ASG G51 and B18 1/4 903, were repaired and returned to service.

The accident occurred at approximately 9:48 am when a crowded picnic train derailed on a sharp left-hand curve between Ferny Grove and Camp Mountain stations on the now-closed [[Ferny Grove railway line|Dayboro line]], approximately 15&nbsp;km (9.3&nbsp;mi) northwest of Brisbane.\n\n===Wallumbilla, 1956===\nOn 1 December 1956 five people were killed and 100 injured.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nThis accident occurred when the '[[The Westlander|Westlander]]' crashed into the 'Western Mail' at Wallumbilla, near [[Western railway line, Queensland|Roma]], SW Qld (467&nbsp;km west of Brisbane). The two trains were intended to cross at the station. However, the 345-tonne Westlander passed through a danger signal without slowing and hit the 200-tonne mail train head-on, pushing it back 46 metres, and derailing both engines and many carriages. Passengers were thrown about and many aboard the mail train were injured by smashed timber in the broken carriages. Ten passengers were admitted to hospital. The Westlander had steel carriages that saved its passengers from any serious injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallumbilla Train Crash|url=http://www.ema.gov.au/ema/emadisasters.nsf/c85916e930b93d50ca256d050020cb1f/721c8c604e96f1b3ca256d330005820f?OpenDocument|publisher=EMA Disasters Database|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Bogantungan (Medway Creek), 1960===\n{{main|Medway Creek rail disaster}}\nOn 26 February 1960 seven people were killed and 43 injured.\n\nThe railway bridge over Medway Creek near [[Central Western railway line, Queensland|Bogantungan]] (100&nbsp;km from Emerald) collapsed after an uprooted gum tree (estimated to weigh 12 tonnes) struck and dislodged one of the pylons as it was swept downstream by floodwaters. The bridge then collapsed as the Rockhampton-bound Midlander passed over it, resulting in 7 dead and 43 injured.

These come from lists of major accidents compiled by some newspapers in the 21st Century. One claimed accident is for 1 January 1913 where it is claimed six persons were killed. The other is for the '''30 January 1913 where it is claimed 14 persons were killed'''. The only reasonably cited reference is to an accident at Murphys Creek (near Toowoomba) on the '''30 January 1913''' (see entry below) where '''six people are reported as being killed'''. There is no verifiable citation for fourteen people being killed in an accident near Toowoomba in 1913.\n\n===Murphys Creek, 1913===\nOn the '''30 January 1913''' '''six people were killed'''.\n\nA goods train had left Toowoomba on the night of 29 January 1913, and had derailed near the [[Murphys Creek railway station]] on the [[Main Line railway, Queensland|Main line]], about one mile from the station yard limits, on the range side near the 84-mile (139&nbsp;km) mark. No members of the crew were injured, but a considerable amount of damage was caused to the goods vehicles and the track. A breakdown gang was sent from Toowoomba and breakdown trains were also despatched from Brisbane and Toowoomba to clear wreckage from the line. The spot where the derailment had taken place was in a relatively inaccessible area and workers had to prise the wreckage apart. Several trips were made by breakdown trains to the derailment site.\n\nAt 9.35am on 30 January, a special train left Holmes to collect passengers from the 6.30am Brisbane train and the Sydney mail train (departed Brisbane 7.50am). The relief special consisted of nine empty coaches, two covered wagons, and two C16 Class engines attached to the front and rear of the train. On the first part of the journey down the range, the train was under control. Mr Hallam said a guard rode on the leading engine to advise the crew of the location of the derailed stock train. The guard and fireman on the lead engine saw a glimpse of the wrecked train through the trees. However, no warning devices (detonators, or red flags) had been deployed to warn the approaching train of the breakdown train's position. The only indication was a warning which was shouted from about 70 metres from the breakdown van by a workman on the line. The driver of the relief special had made several air brake applications on the way down without recharging brake reservoirs. The driver then made an \"injudicious\" application of the Westinghouse brake and was unable to stop his train. The engine propelled by 226 tons (230 tonnes) of combined weight behind its tender collided with the rear of the breakdown train.\n\nThe breakdown van, engine and tender were all driven forward 3.5 metres. The engine collided with an \"H\" wagon that was being re-railed which, in turn, was driven forward into another five goods wagons. Members of the rescue gang, who had been working on the \"H\" wagon, were crushed beneath the wreckage. An additional breakdown train was sent to the crash site from Toowoomba at 10am. Fifty workers dug frantically in the wreckage to free trapped workers, however '''six had died''' due to horrific injuries received in the collision.\n\nThe driver was found to not have approached the scene of the derailment with \"the caution demanded of him\", according to the initial departmental inquiry, and that the guard of the breakdown train had failed to adequately protect the rear of it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rail disaster|url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2009/02/23/rail-disaster-comes-to-light-with-pictures/|publisher=The Chronicle (2009)|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Humphrey, 1918===\nOn 1 June 1918 one man was killed and two women were seriously injured following this collision between a cattle train and a mixed goods on 1 June 1918 at Humphrey station, 20.2&nbsp;km from [[Mungar Junction to Monto Branch Railway|Mundubbera]].

The driver and fireman, Thomas Patrick Duignan, 27, and Evan William Whiting, 22, were thrown clear but suffered severe injuries and extensive burns.

Since then, Florida has been a member of the SEC East Division, and Auburn has been a member of the SEC West Division.  At first, every SEC team played an annual game against two permanent rivals in the other division and a third cross-divisional game that rotated among the other four teams in that division.  Auburn's original two cross-division rivals were Georgia and Florida; Florida's were LSU and Auburn.  In 2002, the SEC changed the cross-division format to one permanent rival and two rotating teams.  Since Auburn's rivalry with Georgia was older and more notable, Georgia remained Auburn's lone cross-division rival while Florida retained their annual game against LSU, and the previously annual Auburn\u2013Florida football rivalry became an intermittent one.  From 2003-2011, the teams were scheduled to play two games every five-year cycle.  In 2012, the SEC added [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]], but kept the football schedule at eight games per season.  As a result, Auburn and Florida now play only two games per 12-year cycle.\n\n== Game results ==\n{{sports rivalry series table\n| no_number = true\n| cols = 2\n| format = standard\n| team1 =

At first, every SEC team played an annual game against two permanent rivals in the other division and a third cross-divisional game that rotated among the other four teams in that division.  Auburn's original two cross-division rivals were Georgia and Florida; Florida's were LSU and Auburn.  In 2002, the SEC changed the cross-division format to one permanent rival and two rotating teams.  Since Auburn's rivalry with Georgia was older and more notable, Georgia remained Auburn's lone cross-division rival while Florida retained their annual game against LSU, and the previously annual Auburn\u2013Florida football rivalry became an intermittent one.  From 2003-2011, the teams were scheduled to play two games every five-year cycle.  In 2012, the SEC added [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]], but kept the football schedule at eight games per season.  As a result, Auburn and Florida now play only two games per 12-year cycle.\n\n== Game results ==\n{{sports rivalry series table\n| no_number = true\n| cols = 2\n| format = standard\n| team1 =

Like operators of other blogs and websites which allow third party users to submit content, Richie has argued that he is protected from liability by a federal law called the [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act|Communications Decency Act]], 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c), which provides: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thedirty.com/contact-us/ |title=FAQ Page on TheDirty |access-date=2012-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711062107/http://thedirty.com/contact-us/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The CDA generally protects website owners and operators from most forms of liability; \"Most courts have held that through these provisions, Congress granted interactive services of all types, including blogs, forums, and listservs, immunity from tort liability so long as the information is provided by a third party.\"<ref>[http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/immunity-online-publishers-under-communications-decency-act Legal Guide to Online Publisher Immunity]</ref>\n\nAt least one federal court in Missouri has agreed with this argument, holding that a lawsuit against Richie was barred by the CDA. The case, ''S.C. v. Dirty World LLC'', Case No. 11-CV-00392-DW (W.D. Mo. March 12, 2012), involved a post entitled \"Dirty Church Girl\" which was submitted to TheDirty.com by a third-party user.

Dirty World Entertainment Recordings, LLC]]'', a federal court in Kentucky reached the opposite conclusion, finding that Richie was not entitled to immunity in a case arising from several posts about a Kentucky high school teacher and part-time cheerleader named Sarah Jones. The decision has been criticized by some legal experts who described the case as \"a troubling and probably lawless ruling.\"<ref>[http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2012/01/thedirty_denied.htm TheDirty Denied 47 USC 230 Immunity\u2014Jones v.

Richie's attorney has responded to this argument claiming that Richie's actions as an editor are irrelevant to his eligibility for immunity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gingraslaw.com/does-editingselecting-content-affect-cda-immunity-absolutely-not |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227214044/http://gingraslaw.com/does-editingselecting-content-affect-cda-immunity-absolutely-not/ |archive-date=2013-12-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Richie filed a successful appeal before [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]].

For example, on March 13, 2014, a federal court in Arkansas found that Richie was not subject to [[personal jurisdiction]] in that state because \"posting defamatory material on the internet, standing alone, is insufficient to create personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the plaintiff's home state.\"<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/212522638/Stewart-v-Karamian-Order-Granting-MTD Order Granting Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction]</ref>  On that basis, the court dismissed the case against Richie, who represented himself in the lawsuit without an attorney.<ref>[http://rumorfix.com/2014/03/nik-richie-represents-himself-in-court-wins-defamation-lawsuit/ Nik Richie Represents Himself In Court, Wins Defamation Lawsuit]</ref> Notably, the Kentucky district court reached the opposite conclusion in the ''Sarah Jones'' case, finding that Richie was subject to personal jurisdiction in that state.<ref>[http://www.dmlp.org/sites/citmedialaw.org/files/2011-01-21-DismissalDenied.pdf Order Denying Motion to Dismiss]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Richie, Nik}}\n[[Category:American bloggers]]\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name = Nik Richie\n| image =\n| caption =\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|mf=yes|1979|2|12}}\n| birth_place = <!--[[Hackensack, New Jersey]], United States-->\n| birth_name = Hooman Karamian\n| occupation = [[Blog]]ger, [[writer]]\n| known_for = Gossip website TheDirty.com; reality TV appearances\n| years_active = 2007\u20132018\n| spouse = [[Shayne Lamas]] (m. 2010\u2013present)\n| children = 2\n}}\n'''Nik Richie''' (born '''Hooman Karamian''',<ref name=VegasSeven /> February 12, 1979),<ref name=tmzbio /> is an American blogger, author,<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2012/02/01/LA45475 | title=Internet Blogger Nik Richie Announces Book Deal | publisher = Nik Ritchie / PR Newswire via BizJournals.com| date=  February 1, 2012}}</ref> and Internet personality.<ref name=tmzbio>{{cite web | url = http://www.tmz.com/person/nik-richie/ | title=Nik Richie | publisher=[[TMZ.cm]]}}</ref> Richie is currently the President and CEO of Relic Agency, Inc., a social media marketing firm based in Newport Beach, California.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/in/nik-lamas-richie-407960174/ Nik Richie LinkedIn]</ref> Richie is also currently pursuing a journalism degree from [[Saddleback College]] in Mission Viejo, California, where he writes for the student-run paper ''Lariat News''.<ref>[https://lariatnews.com/author/niklamas/ Nik Richie Lariat News]</ref>\n\nRichie is best known as the founder of user-submitted gossip website TheDirty.com which he began in 2007 as DirtyScottsdale.com and ceased involvement with in April 2018.\n\n==Background==\nRichie founded the online gossip and \"reality internet\" website TheDirty.com.

Like operators of other blogs and websites which allow third party users to submit content, Richie has argued that he is protected from liability by a federal law called the [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act|Communications Decency Act]], 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c), which provides: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thedirty.com/contact-us/ |title=FAQ Page on TheDirty |access-date=2012-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711062107/http://thedirty.com/contact-us/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The CDA generally protects website owners and operators from most forms of liability; \"Most courts have held that through these provisions, Congress granted interactive services of all types, including blogs, forums, and listservs, immunity from tort liability so long as the information is provided by a third party.\"<ref>[http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/immunity-online-publishers-under-communications-decency-act Legal Guide to Online Publisher Immunity]</ref>\n\nAt least one federal court in Missouri has agreed with this argument, holding that a lawsuit against Richie was barred by the CDA. The case, ''S.C. v. Dirty World LLC'', Case No. 11-CV-00392-DW (W.D. Mo. March 12, 2012), involved a post entitled \"Dirty Church Girl\" which was submitted to TheDirty.com by a third-party user.

Dirty World Entertainment Recordings, LLC]]'', a federal court in Kentucky reached the opposite conclusion, finding that Richie was not entitled to immunity in a case arising from several posts about a Kentucky high school teacher and part-time cheerleader named Sarah Jones. The decision has been criticized by some legal experts who described the case as \"a troubling and probably lawless ruling.\"<ref>[http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2012/01/thedirty_denied.htm TheDirty Denied 47 USC 230 Immunity\u2014Jones v.

Richie's attorney has responded to this argument claiming that Richie's actions as an editor are irrelevant to his eligibility for immunity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gingraslaw.com/does-editingselecting-content-affect-cda-immunity-absolutely-not |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227214044/http://gingraslaw.com/does-editingselecting-content-affect-cda-immunity-absolutely-not/ |archive-date=2013-12-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Richie filed a successful appeal before [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]].

For example, on March 13, 2014, a federal court in Arkansas found that Richie was not subject to [[personal jurisdiction]] in that state because \"posting defamatory material on the internet, standing alone, is insufficient to create personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the plaintiff's home state.\"<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/212522638/Stewart-v-Karamian-Order-Granting-MTD Order Granting Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction]</ref>  On that basis, the court dismissed the case against Richie, who represented himself in the lawsuit without an attorney.<ref>[http://rumorfix.com/2014/03/nik-richie-represents-himself-in-court-wins-defamation-lawsuit/ Nik Richie Represents Himself In Court, Wins Defamation Lawsuit]</ref> Notably, the Kentucky district court reached the opposite conclusion in the ''Sarah Jones'' case, finding that Richie was subject to personal jurisdiction in that state.<ref>[http://www.dmlp.org/sites/citmedialaw.org/files/2011-01-21-DismissalDenied.pdf Order Denying Motion to Dismiss]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Richie, Nik}}\n[[Category:American bloggers]]\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "Kbabej", "label": "safe", "comment": "- space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik_Richie"}

He attended elementary school at La Salle and when his parents moved to France, he went to boarding school at [[Le Rosey]] in Switzerland. After his family lost their possessions as a result of the [[Cuban Revolution]], he moved to the United States.<ref>See his autobiography included in a volume entitled ''\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a?

Since 2000 he has been at the [[University of Chicago]] where he is [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature. He has served as Chair of Romance Languages and Literatures (2006\u20132009; 2010\u20132012). In addition he has been Vice President and President of the Cervantes Society of America (2003\u20132009); and President of AISO Asociacion Internacional Siglo de Oro (2015-2017).\n\n==Career==\nDe Armas' publications focus on early modern Spanish literature and culture, often from a comparative perspective. His interests include the politics of astrology, magic and the Hermetic tradition, [[ekphrasis]], verbal and visual culture, etc.<ref>Carrie L. Ruiz, \"Oscillating trends: A Reflection of the Status of Seventeenth-Century Studies Today: Interview of Frederick A. de Armas\" ''Transitions. Journal of Franco-Iberian Studies'' 5 (2009), pp. 9-25</ref> His early books evince an interest in the relationship between mythology and literature, between the classics and [[Spanish Golden Age]] works. They include: ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (1976), which contains some of the earliest discussions of proto-feminism in early modern Spain,<ref>''The Perception of Women in Spanish Theater of the Golden Age''. Ed. Anita K. Stoll and Dawn L. Smith. Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1991, p. 19</ref> and ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calder\u00f3n'' (1986), which is one of the first studies that approach Calder\u00f3n from a historicist perspective and is also deeply influenced by the writings of the [[Warburg Institute]].<ref>Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez Mosquera, \"El significado de las primeras fiestas cortesanas de Calder\u00f3n,\" ''Calder\u00f3n y el pensamiento ideol\u00f3gico y cultural de su \u00e9poca: XIV Coloquio Anglogermano sobre Calder\u00f3n'', eds., Manfred Tietz y Gero Arnscheidt, Stuttgart, Steiner, 2008, p.224.</ref> For example, he interprets the figure of Circe in one of Calderon's plays as critiquing the policies of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]'s minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares.<ref>Margaret Rich Greer, ''The Play of Power. Mythological Court Dramas of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca.''Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, pp. 88ff.</ref> On the other hand, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] is in many cases a figure that serves to praise the regime. His interest in Golden Age Theater has led him to publish several book collections: ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sue\u00f1o\"'' (1993), ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"'' (1996) and ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (1998).\n\nOne of his main interests throughout his career has been the relationship between the verbal and the visual in early modern Spanish literature and Italian art. In recent years, this subject has become central to his research, as evinced by the book, ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge, 1998).  This study focuses on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes\u2019]] most famous tragedy, ''[[The Siege of Numantia|La Numancia]]'', showing how it is engaged in a conversation with classical authors of Greece and Rome, especially through the interpretations of antiquity presented by the artist [[Raphael]]. This book was followed by the collections ''Writing for the Eyes in the Spanish Golden Age'' (2004) and ''Ekphrasis in the Age of Cervantes'' (2005). In the introduction to this last collection he establishes a typology of [[ekphrasis]], including definitions for allusive, collectionist, descriptive, dramatic, interpolated, narrative, shaping, and veiled ekphrasis, as well as meta-ekphrasis and ur-ekphrasis. He applies these terms in his book: ''Quixotic Frescoes. Cervantes and Italian Art'' (Toronto, 2006).\n\nAfter his book on Cervantes and Italian art, he co-edited two collections on Spanish Golden Age theater. The first one, on tragedy, is entitled ''Hacia la tragedia: Lecturas para un nuevo milenio'' (Madrid, 2008); and the second one, on a specific writer is called ''Calder\u00f3n: del manuscrito a la escena'' (2011). At the same time, he continues to work on Cervantes, having published an edited volume, ''Ovid in the Age of Cervantes'' (2010). His latest book, ''Don Quixote among the Saracens: Clashes of Civilizations and Literary Genres'' (2011) has received the American Publishers' Association PROSE Award in Literature, Honorable Mention (2011). <ref> https://proseawards.com/winners/2011-award-winners/</ref> The book has a double focus. The first has to do with a [[clash of civilizations]] and asks: Why is [[Don Quixote]] at peace among the Saracens? The second has to do with Don Quixote as an \"imperial\" vehicle for the assimilation or destruction of literary genres.\n\nStarting around 2008 De Armas became increasingly interested in the cultural and literary productions of the maternal side of his family, publishing essays on  Ana Gald\u00f3s, Domingo A. Gald\u00f3s and [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]].<ref> Frederick A. de Armas, \u201cUna conversaci\u00f3n trasatl\u00e1ntica: P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s y el cubano Domingo A.

His novel, ''El abra del Yumuri'', takes place in Cuba during the last three months of 1958, just before the fall of [[Fulgencio Batista]] and the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. It focuses on the lives of five women, most of them from the upper bourgeoisie, and how they deal with political and social upheaval, as well as the dangers of a serial killer that preys on women of means. For some critics, the novel combines two very different trends: that of the social novel inspired by [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], and that of [[magic realism]] embodied by [[Alejo Carpentier]]. <ref> Jose Mar\u00eda Pozuelo Yvancos, \"El abra del Yumuri: La Habana antes del fin,\" ''ABC Cultural'', enero 2017.  http://www.abc.es/cultura/cultural/abci-abra-yumuri-habana-antes-201701130220_noticia.html </ref> His second novel ''Sinfon\u00eda Salvaje'', includes some of the same women that appeared in his first, but, set in the last half of 1959, these characters are now concerned with social and political changes due to the revolution. These changes are embodied in a [[transvestite]] and in the belief that some revolutionaries look like wolves, thus espousing the belief in the [[werewolf]]  <ref> https://www.viceversa-mag.com/para-leer-sinfonia-salvaje-de-frederick-a-de-armas/ </ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The Four Interpolated Stories in the Roman Comique'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1971).\n* ''Paul Scarron'' (New York: Twayne Books, 1972).\n* ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (Charlottesville: Biblioteca Siglo de Oro, 1976).\n* ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calder\u00f3n'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1986).\n* ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sue\u00f1o\"'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1993).\n* ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1996).\n* ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1998).\n* ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998).\n* ''European Literary Careers: The Author from Antiquity to the Renaissance'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002).

Mellon]] Distinguished Service Professor in Humanities at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\n==Biography==\nFrederick A. de Armas was born in Havana, Cuba on February 9, 1945. He attended elementary school at La Salle and when his parents moved to France, he went to boarding school at [[Le Rosey]] in Switzerland. After his family lost their possessions as a result of the [[Cuban Revolution]], he moved to the United States.<ref>See his autobiography included in a volume entitled ''\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a?  Memorias del hispanismo estadounidense'', eds. Anna Caballe Masrorroll and Randolph D. Pope. Barcelona: Galaxia Gutenberg, 2015.</ref> De Armas holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1969), and has taught at [[Louisiana State University]] (1969\u20131988), [[Pennsylvania State University]] (where he was [[Edwin Erle Sparks]] Professor of Spanish and Comparative Literature) (1988\u20132000) and has been a visiting professor at [[Duke University]] (1994). Since 2000 he has been at the [[University of Chicago]] where he is [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature. He has served as Chair of Romance Languages and Literatures (2006\u20132009; 2010\u20132012). In addition he has been Vice President and President of the Cervantes Society of America (2003\u20132009); and President of AISO Asociacion Internacional Siglo de Oro (2015-2017).\n\n==Career==\nDe Armas' publications focus on early modern Spanish literature and culture, often from a comparative perspective. His interests include the politics of astrology, magic and the Hermetic tradition, [[ekphrasis]], verbal and visual culture, etc.<ref>Carrie L. Ruiz, \"Oscillating trends: A Reflection of the Status of Seventeenth-Century Studies Today: Interview of Frederick A. de Armas\" ''Transitions. Journal of Franco-Iberian Studies'' 5 (2009), pp. 9-25</ref> His early books evince an interest in the relationship between mythology and literature, between the classics and [[Spanish Golden Age]] works. They include: ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (1976), which contains some of the earliest discussions of proto-feminism in early modern Spain,<ref>''The Perception of Women in Spanish Theater of the Golden Age''. Ed. Anita K. Stoll and Dawn L. Smith. Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1991, p. 19</ref> and ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calder\u00f3n'' (1986), which is one of the first studies that approach Calder\u00f3n from a historicist perspective and is also deeply influenced by the writings of the [[Warburg Institute]].<ref>Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez Mosquera, \"El significado de las primeras fiestas cortesanas de Calder\u00f3n,\" ''Calder\u00f3n y el pensamiento ideol\u00f3gico y cultural de su \u00e9poca: XIV Coloquio Anglogermano sobre Calder\u00f3n'', eds., Manfred Tietz y Gero Arnscheidt, Stuttgart, Steiner, 2008, p.224.</ref> For example, he interprets the figure of Circe in one of Calderon's plays as critiquing the policies of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]'s minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares.<ref>Margaret Rich Greer, ''The Play of Power. Mythological Court Dramas of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca.''Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, pp. 88ff.</ref> On the other hand, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] is in many cases a figure that serves to praise the regime. His interest in Golden Age Theater has led him to publish several book collections: ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sue\u00f1o\"'' (1993), ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"'' (1996) and ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (1998).\n\nOne of his main interests throughout his career has been the relationship between the verbal and the visual in early modern Spanish literature and Italian art. In recent years, this subject has become central to his research, as evinced by the book, ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge, 1998).  This study focuses on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes\u2019]] most famous tragedy, ''[[The Siege of Numantia|La Numancia]]'', showing how it is engaged in a conversation with classical authors of Greece and Rome, especially through the interpretations of antiquity presented by the artist [[Raphael]]. This book was followed by the collections ''Writing for the Eyes in the Spanish Golden Age'' (2004) and ''Ekphrasis in the Age of Cervantes'' (2005). In the introduction to this last collection he establishes a typology of [[ekphrasis]], including definitions for allusive, collectionist, descriptive, dramatic, interpolated, narrative, shaping, and veiled ekphrasis, as well as meta-ekphrasis and ur-ekphrasis. He applies these terms in his book: ''Quixotic Frescoes. Cervantes and Italian Art'' (Toronto, 2006).\n\nAfter his book on Cervantes and Italian art, he co-edited two collections on Spanish Golden Age theater. The first one, on tragedy, is entitled ''Hacia la tragedia: Lecturas para un nuevo milenio'' (Madrid, 2008); and the second one, on a specific writer is called ''Calder\u00f3n: del manuscrito a la escena'' (2011). At the same time, he continues to work on Cervantes, having published an edited volume, ''Ovid in the Age of Cervantes'' (2010). His latest book, ''Don Quixote among the Saracens: Clashes of Civilizations and Literary Genres'' (2011) has received the American Publishers' Association PROSE Award in Literature, Honorable Mention (2011). <ref> https://proseawards.com/winners/2011-award-winners/</ref> The book has a double focus. The first has to do with a [[clash of civilizations]] and asks: Why is [[Don Quixote]] at peace among the Saracens? The second has to do with Don Quixote as an \"imperial\" vehicle for the assimilation or destruction of literary genres.\n\nStarting around 2008 De Armas became increasingly interested in the cultural and literary productions of the maternal side of his family, publishing essays on  Ana Gald\u00f3s, Domingo A. Gald\u00f3s and [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]].<ref> Frederick A. de Armas, \u201cUna conversaci\u00f3n trasatl\u00e1ntica: P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s y el cubano Domingo A. Gald\u00f3s en ''La estrella de Panam\u00e1'' (1889-1902)\u201d ''Revista de Literatura''77.154 (2015): 371-97. https://doi.org/10.3989/revliteratura.2015.02.002 </ref> He has also started to publish fiction while continuing to work on the literature and culture of early modern Spain. His novel, ''El abra del Yumuri'', takes place in Cuba during the last three months of 1958, just before the fall of [[Fulgencio Batista]] and the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. It focuses on the lives of five women, most of them from the upper bourgeoisie, and how they deal with political and social upheaval, as well as the dangers of a serial killer that preys on women of means. For some critics, the novel combines two very different trends: that of the social novel inspired by [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], and that of [[magic realism]] embodied by [[Alejo Carpentier]]. <ref> Jose Mar\u00eda Pozuelo Yvancos, \"El abra del Yumuri: La Habana antes del fin,\" ''ABC Cultural'', enero 2017.  http://www.abc.es/cultura/cultural/abci-abra-yumuri-habana-antes-201701130220_noticia.html </ref> His second novel ''Sinfon\u00eda Salvaje'', includes some of the same women that appeared in his first, but, set in the last half of 1959, these characters are now concerned with social and political changes due to the revolution. These changes are embodied in a [[transvestite]] and in the belief that some revolutionaries look like wolves, thus espousing the belief in the [[werewolf]]  <ref> https://www.viceversa-mag.com/para-leer-sinfonia-salvaje-de-frederick-a-de-armas/ </ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The Four Interpolated Stories in the Roman Comique'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1971).\n* ''Paul Scarron'' (New York: Twayne Books, 1972).\n* ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (Charlottesville: Biblioteca Siglo de Oro, 1976).\n* ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calder\u00f3n'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1986).\n* ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sue\u00f1o\"'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1993).\n* ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1996).\n* ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1998).\n* ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998).\n* ''European Literary Careers: The Author from Antiquity to the Renaissance'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002).

As of current production, the Ford F-Series includes the F-150 pickup, F-250 through F-450 Super Duty pickups, F-450/550 Super Duty chassis cabs, and F-650/750 Super Duty Class 6-8 trucks.  The most popular version of the F-Series is the F-150, now in its thirteenth generation.\n\nThe best-selling pickup truck in the United States since 1977 (the highest-selling vehicle overall since 1981)<ref>{{cite journal|date=May 25, 2007|title=Ford's Best Selling Pickups Add More Features For 2008|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2007/163_news070524_2008_ford_trucks_features|journal=Truck Trend|publisher=Ford Motor Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/auto-sales-reach-six-year-high-demand-peaked-article-1.1567645|title=Auto sales reach six-year high of 15.6 million vehicles sold, Ford F-Series takes the cake|date=January 6, 2014|work=Daily News|access-date=|url-status=live|location=New York}}</ref>; the F-Series is also the best-selling vehicle in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cato|first=Jeremy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/top-10-best-selling-vehicles/article1512191/|title=Top 10 best-selling vehicles|date=March 25, 2010|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto}}</ref>  As of the 2018 model year, the F-Series generated $41 billion in annual revenue for Ford.<ref>[http://www.motortrend.com/news/future-ford-filled-mustangs-trucks-off-road-suvs/ FUTURE OF FORD IS FILLED WITH CREAM MUSTANGS, TRUCKS, OFF-ROAD SUVS] ''[[Motor Trend]]'' (03/15/2018)</ref>  At various times, Ford has marketed the F-Series across all three of its divisions in North America.  From 1948 to 1968, Mercury marketed the F-Series as the [[Mercury M-Series|M-Series]] (in Canada); during the 2000s, Lincoln sold the F-150 as the [[Lincoln Blackwood|Blackwood]] and the later [[Lincoln Mark LT|Mark LT]]. The F-series platform has underpinned several sport utility vehicles, including the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Ford Expedition]] and [[Lincoln Navigator]].\n\nAs of current production, the Ford F-Series is manufactured by Ford in four facilities in the United States.   \n\n== First generation (1948\u20131952) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (first generation)}}\n[[File:1950 Ford F3.jpg|thumb|1950 F-3]]\n\nThe first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in 1948 as a replacement for the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, cab-over engine (COE), conventional truck, and school bus chassis body styles.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1953\u20131956) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (second generation)}}\n[[File:1954 Ford F-100 Red.jpg|thumb|1953 F-100]]\n\nFor the 1953 model year, Ford introduced a second generation of the F-Series trucks. Increased dimensions, improved engines, and an updated chassis were features of the second generation.  In another change, the model nomenclature of the F-Series was expanded to three numbers; this remains in use in the present day.  The half-ton F-1 became the F-100 (partially influenced by the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}; the F-2 and F-3 were combined into the {{3/4}}-ton F-250 while the F-4 became the one-ton F-350.  Conventional F-Series trucks were F-500 to F-900; COE chassis were renamed C-Series trucks.\n\nWhile the cabs, doors, radiator support, inner fenders and hoods are the same from 1953-1956 F-100 & F-250s (the fenders varied on F-250, F-350, F-500 and long boxes were only available on F-250), in 1956 the cab underwent a major revision.  Centered around a wraparound windshield, the cab was given new doors, a redesigned dashboard, and an (optional) panoramic rear window.  In line with Ford cars, the 1956 F-Series offered seat belts as an option.\n\n[[File:1953 F100 Diagram.jpg|thumb|center|1953 F100 Build Diagram]]{{clear}}\n\n== Third generation (1957\u20131960) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (third generation)}}\n[[File:1960 Ford F-500 stake truck black fr.jpg|thumb|1960 F-500]]\n\nIntroduced in 1957, the third generation F-series was a significant modernization and redesign. Front fenders became integrated into the body, and the new Styleside bed continued the smooth lines to the rear of the pickup.\n\nThe cab-over F-Series was discontinued, having been replaced by the tilt-cab [[Ford C-Series|C-Series]].\n\nIn 1959, Ford began in-house production of four-wheel-drive pickups.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1961\u20131966) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (fourth generation)}}\n[[File:1965 Ford F100 Pick Up.jpg|thumb|1965 F-100]]\n\nFord introduced a dramatically new style of pickup in 1961 with the fourth generation F-Series. Longer and lower than its predecessors, these trucks had increased dimensions and new engine and gearbox choices. Additionally, the 1961\u20131963 models offered an optional unibody design with the cab and bed integrated.  The traditional separate cab/bed was offered concurrently.  The unibody proved unpopular, and Ford discontinued the option after the 1963 model year.\n\nIn 1965, the F-Series was given a significant mid-cycle redesign. A completely new platform, including the \"[[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]\" front suspension, was introduced that would be used until 1996 on the F-150 and until 2016 on the F-250/350 4x2. Additionally that year, the Ranger name made its first appearance on a Ford pickup; previously a base model of the Edsel, it was now used to denote a high-level styling package for F-Series pickups.<ref>This F-series Ranger is distinct from compact [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] series of pickup trucks introduced in 1983 for North America, although the latter used technology from the full-size trucks, such as the Twin I-Beam front suspension on two-wheel-drive models and Twin Traction Beam suspension on four-wheel-drive.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation (1967\u20131972) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (fifth generation)}}\n[[File:1972 Ford F-250 Camper Special pickup.jpg|thumb|1972 F-250 camper special ]]\n\nIntroduced in 1967, the fifth generation F-series pickup was built on the same platform as the 1965 revision of the fourth generation. Dimensions and greenhouse glass were increased, engine options expanded, and plusher trim levels became available during the fifth generation's production run.\n\nSuspension components from all 1969 F-Series models are completely interchangeable.\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1973\u20131979) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (sixth generation)}}\n[[File:Ford F-250 Ranger.jpg|thumb|1979 F-250 Ranger]]\n\nThe sixth generation F-series was introduced in 1973. This version of the F-series continued to be built on the 1965 fourth generation's revised platform, but with significant modernization and refinements, including front disc brakes, increased cabin dimensions, full double wall bed construction and increased use of galvanized steel.\n\nThe FE engine series was discontinued in 1976 after a nearly 20-year run, replaced by the more modern 335 & 385 series engines.\n\nIn 1975, the F-150 was introduced in between the F-100 and the F-250 in order to avoid certain emission control restrictions. For 1978, square headlights replaced the previous models' round ones on higher trim package models, such as Lariat and Ranger, and in 1979 became standard equipment. Also for 1978, the Ford Bronco was redesigned into a variant of the F-series pickup. 1979 was the last year that the 460 engine was available in a half ton truck.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1980\u20131986) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (seventh generation)}}\n[[File:7th-Ford-F150.jpg|thumb|F-150 XL]]\n\nThe 1980 F-Series was designed with an all-new chassis and larger body; this was the first ground-up redesign since 1965. The exterior styling of the truck was redone to improve aerodynamics and fuel economy. Medium-duty F-Series (F600-F900) were also redesigned; although they shared the cabin of the smaller pickup trucks, the largest version of F-Series now wore a bonnet with separate front wings (like the [[Ford L-Series Trucks|L-Series]]). Medium duty Ford F-Series would carry the 1980\u20131986 interior design until 2000 (though pickups were restyled again in 1987 and 1992), with very subtle changes such as window glass and electronics.\n\nIn a move toward fuel efficiency, Ford dropped the M-Series engines (the 5.8 Liter ''351M'' and 6.6 Liter 400&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8s) in 1981, replacing them with the 4.2 Liter 255 C.I. and 5.8 Liter 351 C.I. [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor V8]] engines from the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]]. The 255 V8 was simply a 5.0L, 302 V8 with a smaller bore, built specifically for better fuel economy, but was dropped for the 1982 model year due to being underpowered and having limited demand. For 1982 and 1983, the 3.8L, 232 C.I. Essex V6 was the base engine but was quickly dropped for the 1984 model year. In 1983, Ford added Diesel power to the F-Series through a partnership with [[International Harvester]] (later [[Navistar]]). The 6.9L, 420 C.I. IDI V8 produced similar power output as the gasoline 351 Windsor V8, with the fuel economy of the 4.9L, 300 cubic inch I6. From this point on (1983\u2013present), the heavier duty f-series trucks (F-350 and above) were usually equipped with Diesel engines. 1985 was the first year of electronic fuel injection on the 5.0L V8, all other engines following suit in 1988. There was a new \"high output\" version of the 5.8L Windsor beginning in 1984.\n\nA noticeable change was made to the F-Series in 1982 as the Ford \"Blue Oval\" was added to the center of the grill, also the Ranger and Custom trims were no longer available. The Ranger name had been shifted onto the all-new compact pickup developed as a replacement for the Courier. The new trim levels were a no-badge base model (essentially the new Custom), XL, a very rare XLS, and XLT Lariat.\n\n1983 marked the final year of the F-100, making the F-150 the lightest pickup available on the market. F-100s and F-150s were virtually identical with the exception of smaller brakes. F-100s over a certain GVWR and/or without power brakes did use the F-150 axles. Also, the 1980\u20131983 F-100 was never offered with four-wheel-drive.\n\n1986 marked the final year that the F-150 was available with a 3-speed manual gearbox that shifted via a steering column lever (3-on-the-tree). Incidentally, this was the second-to-last vehicle in the United States to offer this set up. 1986 was also the last year the Explorer package was available.\n\nThis is the first generation of trucks to incorporate amenities such as power mirrors, power windows, and power door locks.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (1987\u20131991) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (eighth generation)}}\n[[File:Ford F-150 -- 09-07-2009.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 (light-duty type)]]\n\nThe 1987 F-Series carried over the same body style from the seventh generation, yet sported a new rounded front clip that improved aerodynamics, as well as the softening of body lines around the rear of the bed and fender arches around the wheel wells. The interior was also completely redesigned in 1987. The transmissions available on SuperCab models were a four-speed or five-speed manual; regular cab models were also available with automatic transmission. The Custom trim made a comeback for the eighth generation. In 1988, the 4.9 Liter inline-six, 5.8 Liter V8, and 7.5 Liter V8 engines gained electronic fuel injection. International Navistar also increased the displacement of their 6.9 Liter V8 in the same year, resulting in the new 7.3 Liter unit. This was also the first year of a five-speed manual overdrive transmission, which included the Mazda ''M5OD'' in the F-150s and the heavy-duty ZF5 in the F-250s and F-350s. Four-speed manuals were discontinued as standard equipment after 1987, but were available as a customer-ordered option until 1989. In 1989, the C6 three-speed automatic was replaced as the base automatic transmission with the ''E4OD'', a four-speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive unit, though the C6 was still available as an option, mostly in F-250s and F-350s, until 1997. Heavy-Duty models included F-250s and F-350s (along with F-Super Dutys) that were classified as incomplete vehicles only that were produced with no bed, but appeared as [[tow truck]]s, box trucks (notably [[U-Haul]]), flatbed trucks, [[dump truck]]s and other models..\n\n== Ninth generation (1992\u20131997) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (ninth generation)}}\n[[File:1993 F-150 with dual gas tanks.jpg|thumb|1993 Ford F-150, with dual fuel tanks]]\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the body-shell of the 1980 F-Series was given another major upgrade. To further improve its aerodynamics, the forward bodywork was given a slightly lower hoodline, rounding the front fenders and grille; in addition, the changes matched the F-Series with the design of the newly introduced Explorer and redesigned E-Series and Ranger. Along with the exterior updates, the interior received a complete redesign.\n\nLast used in 1987, the FlareSide bed made its return as an option for 1992. To appeal to younger buyers, the bed bodywork was redesigned. Borrowing the sides of a dual rear wheel F-350 and molding them to a narrowed F-150 bed a FlairSide bed was created.\n\nTo commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first Ford factory-produced truck (the 1917 [[Ford Model TT]]), Ford offered a 75th anniversary package on its 1992 F-series, consisting of a stripe package, an argent colored step bumper, and special 75th anniversary logos. In 1993, the 240&nbsp;hp SVT Lightning was introduced as a specially-tuned performance truck; over 11,000 were built from 1993 to 1995.\n\nIn a trim shift, the XLT Lariat was dropped and combined with the XLT; the XL took over for the Custom trim after 1993 (marking the last usage of the Custom nameplate by Ford). In 1995, the Eddie Bauer trim made its return.\n\nIn 1994.5 model year the 7.3L Indirect injected (IDI) was replaced instead with International/Navistar's t444e 445 C.I (275Hp,550Tq which Ford badged as its powerstroke turbo diesel the 7.3 liter powerstroke only kept the same displacement, bore size, and stroke length from the IDI motor.\n\nIn 1995, the medium-duty Ford F-Series (F-600 through F-800 and all Ford B-Series) were given their first update since 1980. All versions (except severe-service) received a hood redesign which enlarged the grille and moved the turn signal indicators to the outside of the front headlights.\n\nDuring the second half of 1997, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350. The body style stayed the same until the end of 1997. The only change of the F-250 HD and F-350 was that they no longer has classic style tailgates, with the stainless steel cap on them which read FORD. Instead the tailgate had the '''F-250 Heavy Duty'''/'''F-350''' nameplate labeled on its left side, while Ford's blue oval was labeled on The right side (similarly styled like the 1997 Ford F-150 around this same time). The F-250 HD also had some minor changes in trim location, and options available. The 1997 F-250 HD with the 7.3 Powerstroke Diesel is also the rarest and most desirable of ninth generation Fords.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tenth-generation F-150, the F-250 and F-350 continued into production into the 1998 model year, becoming part of the [[Ford Super Duty|Ford F-Series Super Duty]] line as they were replaced in 1999.\n\n== Tenth generation (1997\u20132004) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (tenth generation)}}\n[[File:'97-'98 Ford F-250 XL Regular Cab.JPG|thumb|1999-2000 F-250 XL]]\n\nFor 1997, Ford Motor Company made a major change to its F-Series family of trucks as the F-Series pickup line was essentially split in two. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, buyers of pickup trucks had increasingly purchased the vehicles for the purposes of personal use over work use. To further increase its growing market share, Ford sought to develop vehicles for both types of buyers. In its ultimate decision, the company decided to make the F-150 as a contemporary vehicle for personal use, while the F-250 and F-350 would be designed more conservatively for work-based customers.\n\nIntroduced in early 1996 as a 1997 model, the F-150 was a completely new vehicle in comparison from its predecessor. Similar to the original Ford Taurus of 1986, the 1997 F-150 was developed with a radically streamlined body. Dispensing with the traditional Twin I-Beam for a fully independent front suspension, the all-new chassis only shared the transmissions with the previous generation. In a major change, the long-running 4.9L inline-6 was replaced by a 4.2&nbsp;L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#4.2|Essex]] V6 engine as standard. The 4.6&nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#4.6|Modular]] V8 shared with the Panther Car was optional (with a bigger 5.4&nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4|Triton]] V8 version added in mid-1997). Originally developed for use in the F-Series, the Modular/Triton V8 was the first overhead-camshaft engine ever to be installed in a full-size pickup truck.\n\nTo improve rear-seat access for SuperCab models, a rear-hinged (curb-side) door was added to all versions. Following its popularity, the SuperCab gained a fourth door for 1999. In 2001, the F-150 became the first pickup truck in its size segment to become available with four full-size doors from the factory. Sharing the length of a standard-bed SuperCab, the F-150 SuperCrew was produced with a slightly shortened bed.\n\nDuring the second half of the 1997 model year, Ford introduced a heavier GVWR version (7700 GVWR) bearing the F-250 name. It was distinguished by a unique seven-lug bolt pattern for the wheels. At the same time, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350 (same square body style as the last generation F-150; it was still built in [[South America]] only). Due the Super Duty trucks never reaching Ford dealerships as for sale until the beginning of 1999, Ford produced a lighter duty F-250, using the same body the F-150 had at the time as a temporarily model (1997 to 1999). By February 1999, the  light duty F-250 was replaced by the F-150 7700-pound GVWR package, leaving the F-250 Super Duty as the only model using the name.\n\nIn 1999, the SVT Lightning made its return, with an Eaton supercharger increasing the 5.4&nbsp;L V8's output to 360&nbsp;hp (380&nbsp;hp for 2001 onward); over 28,000 were produced from 1999 to 2004. For 2002, Lincoln-Mercury gained its first full-size pickup truck since 1968 with the introduction of the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first Lincoln pickup. Sharing the front bodywork of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV and the same cab body work as the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150]], the Blackwood was designed with a model-exclusive bed and was sold only in black. Due to very poor sales, the Blackwood was discontinued after 2002.\n\nIn 1999, the F-250 and F-350 pickups were introduced as the 1999 [[Ford Super Duty|Ford F-Series Super Duty]] model line. While remaining part of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks use a different platform architecture, powertrain, and design language, primarily as they are intended for heavy-duty work use. Designed in a joint venture with [[Navistar International]], the medium-duty [[Ford F-650|F-650/F-750 Super Duty]] were introduced in 2000.\n\nThis generation of F-150 continued production in 2004 alongside the all-new F-150 as the F-150 Heritage.\n\n== Eleventh generation (2004\u20132008) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)}}\n[[File:Ford F150 FX4 2004.jpg|thumb|2004 F-150 FX4]]\n\nFor the 2004 model year, the F-150 was redesigned on [[Ford P platform#P2|an all-new platform]]. The new platform starts off with a fully boxed in frame and introduced rear shocks to mount outside of the frame for decreased wheel hop and improved ride quality. This new body style kept the fully independent front suspension introduced in the last generation but added vacuum driven front wheel hubs for the 4 wheel drive versions.  The previous generation had full time connected front axles.  The improvement saves fuel and by default goes into a wheel locked position. Should a failure occur in the vacuum solenoid, system, or hoses the wheel hub default to a 4wd position to keep from leaving a driver stranded.  Internally, a 3-valve version of the 5.4 Liter V8 was introduced and replaced the previous 2-valve version. Externally, the eleventh-generation model was different from its predecessor, with sharper-edged styling; a major change was the adoption of the stepped driver's window from the Super Duty trucks. Regardless of cab type, all F-150s were given four doors, with the rear doors on the regular cab providing access to behind-the-seat storage. Ford also introduced additional variants of the F-150. The FX4 Off-Road package available since the 2002 model year became its own trim level. A sportier version of the F-150 became available as STX, replaced by FX2 Sport in 2007.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Lincoln-Mercury dealers sold this version of the F-150 as the [[Lincoln Mark LT]], replacing the Blackwood.\n\nIn late 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Super Duty trucks were given an [[Ford P platform#P3|all-new platform]]. While using the same bed and cabin as before, these are distinguished from their predecessors by an all-new interior and a much larger grille and [[head lamp]]s. Previously available only as a chassis-cab model, the F-450 now was available as a pickup directly from Ford.<ref>{{citation |title=Ford F-150 \u2013 Boosting The EcoBoost |work=Truckin Magazine |first=Barry |last=Cluczyk |date=December 2012}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n== Twelfth generation (2009\u20132014) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (twelfth generation)}}\n[[File:2009 Ford F-150 XLT SuperCrew.jpg|thumb|2009 F-150 XLT SuperCrew]]\n\nThe twelfth generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year as an update of the [[Ford P platform#P415|Ford full-size truck platform]]. Similar to its predecessor, these trucks are distinguished by their Super Duty-style grilles and head lamps; standard cab models again have two-doors instead of four. The FlareSide bed was continued until 2010, dropped along with the manual gearbox; outside of Mexico, the Lincoln Mark LT was replaced by the F-150 Platinum. A new model for 2010 included the SVT Raptor, a dedicated off-road pickup.\n\nIn 2010 Ford shifted its electronics from a GEM (General electric module) based to the computerized and programmable BCM (Body Control Module) Allowing for fewer parts differences and programmable upgrade options from the dealer or factory.  In 2011 Ford reintroduced the 5.0 in the F series with its new 5.0 Coyote dual over head cam TiVVT engine with 360hp.\n\nAs part of a major focus on fuel economy, the entire engine lineup for the F-150 was updated for the 2011 model year. Along with the new V8 engine, the F-150 gained a new 3.7 Liter base V6 engine, and a powerful twin-turbocharged 3.5 Liter V6, dubbed [[Ford EcoBoost engine#EcoBoost V6|EcoBoost]] by Ford. An automatic transmission is the only option. Other modifications include the addition of a [[Nexteer Automotive]] [[Power steering|Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system on most models.\n\nA recent study conducted by [[iSeeCars.com]] and published on the Ford Motor Company website listed the Ford F-250 Super Duty as the longest-lasting vehicle and Expedition, Explorer and F-150 among the top 20 longest-lasting vehicles.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://social.ford.com/our-articles/suvs/expedition/five-ford-vehicles-made-the-200000-mile-list/ |title=Five Ford Vehicles Made the 200,000-Mile List |publisher=Ford.com |access-date=May 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530023147/http://social.ford.com/our-articles/suvs/expedition/five-ford-vehicles-made-the-200000-mile-list/ |archivedate=May 30, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Thirteenth generation (2015\u2013present) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)}}\n[[File:2018 Ford F-150 XLT front (2) 5.19.18.jpg|thumb|2018 F-150 XLT SuperCab]]\n\nThe thirteenth-generation Ford F-Series was introduced for the 2015 model year.  Largely previewed by the [[Ford Atlas]] concept vehicle at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the new design marked several extensive changes to the F-Series design.  In the interest of fuel economy, Ford designers reduced curb weight of the F-150 by nearly 750 pounds, without physically altering its exterior footprint.

While these variants primarily consist of trim packages, others are high-performance versions while other variants were designed with various means of improving functionality.\n\n=== Unibody F-Series (1961-1963) ===\nFor 1961 into part of the 1963 model year, the Ford F-Series was offered with a third body configuration, integrating the Styleside bed with the cab. With the pickup bed stampings welded directly to the cab before both assemblies were mounted to the frame, the design simplified the assembly and paint process (the configuration was similar to that of the [[Ford Ranchero]]).  Following a poor market reception, the unibody pickup bed design was withdrawn during the 1963 model year.\n\n=== Specials (1961-1979) ===\nFrom 1961 to 1979, Ford offered several ''Special'' option packages for the F-Series, typically designed for owners with specific uses for their vehicles.  For 1961, the ''Camper Special'' option package was introduced; designed for owners of [[Truck camper|slide-in truck campers]], the option package featured pre-wiring for the camper, heavy-duty transmission and engine cooling, and a larger alternator.  For 1968, Ford introduced the ''Contractor's Special'', and ''Farm and Ranch Special'', which featured toolboxes and heavier-duty suspension.  The ''Explorer Special'' was introduced as a lower-priced variant of the Ranger trim. The \"Trailer Special\" was offered as well with trailer brake, heavy-duty radiator, transmission cooler, and tow hitch.\n\nIn 1980, the Special option packages were withdrawn as part of the F-Series redesign, while a number of features continued as stand-alone options; the Explorer continued as a variant of the Ranger trim through the 1986 model year.\n\n=== F-150 Nite (1991-1992) ===\nSold from 1991 to 1992 on the Ford F-150 XLT Lariat, the Nite special edition was an monochromatic option package, featuring black paint and trim with a multicolor accent stripe. For 1991, it was exclusive to the regular-cab F-150; for 1992, it was available on all bodystyles of the F-150 and introduced on the Ford Bronco.\n\nThe Nite edition was available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive with either the 5.0L or 5.8L V8; it also included a sport suspension and alloy wheels on 235/75R15 white-letter tires.\n\n=== Eddie Bauer (1994-1996) ===\nFor 1994, Ford introduced the Eddie Bauer trim level for the F-150. In a fashion similar to the same trim packages on the Aerostar, Bronco, and Explorer/Bronco II, it consisted of outdoors-themed interior trim with two-tone exterior paint.\n\n=== SVT Lightning (1993-1995; 1999-2004) ===\n{{Main|Ford_F-Series_tenth_generation#SVT_Lightning|l1=Ford SVT Lightning}}\n[[File:1993FordLightning.jpg|thumb|1993 Ford SVT Lightning]]\n[[File:Ford-F150-Lightning.jpg|thumb|Second-generation Ford SVT Lightning]]\n\nIntroduced as a 1993 model, the Ford SVT Lightning is a [[Performance car|high-performance version]] of the F-150 that was produced by the Ford Special Vehicle Team ([[Ford SVT|SVT]]).  Intended as a competitor for the [[Chevrolet 454 SS|Chevrolet 454SS]], the SVT Lightning was derived from the F-150; to improve its handling, extensive modifications were made to the front and rear suspension and frame.  Powered by a 240&nbsp;hp version of the 5.8L V8, the Lightning used a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic transmission from the F-350 (normally paired with the 7.5L V8 or 7.3L diesel V8).  While slower in acceleration than the [[GMC Syclone]], the Lightning retained nearly all of the towing and payload capacity of a standard Ford F-150.  Produced from 1993 to 1995, the first-generation SVT Lightning was withdrawn as Ford readied the 1997 Ford F-150 for sale.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Ford released a second generation of the SVT Lightning for the 1999 model year.  In line with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the second-generation Lightning was based on the F-150 with a number of suspension modifications; in a design change, all examples were produced with a FlareSide bed.  In place of a model-specific engine, the second-generation was powered by a supercharged version of the 5.4L V8 from the F-150, producing 360&nbsp;hp (increased to 380&nbsp;hp in 2001).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=Hunting |title=Ford SVT Lightning Perfected the Modern Muscle Truck Formula |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/ford-svt-lightning-perfected-the-modern-muscle-truck-formula/ |website=Driving Line |publisher=Nitto Tire |accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>  As before, the higher-output engine was paired with a heavier-duty transmission from the F-350 pickup.\n\nFor the 2004 redesign of the Ford F-150, the SVT Lightning was not included, leaving 2004 as the final year for the model line.  While of an entirely different design focus from the SVT Lightning, the SVT/Ford Raptor is the succeeding generation of high-performance Ford F-Series pickup trucks.\n\n=== Harley-Davidson Edition (2000-2011) ===\nFrom 2000 to 2011, the [[Harley-Davidson]] Edition was an option package available on the F-150.  Primarily an appearance package featuring monochromatic black trim, from 2002 to 2003, the edition included a slightly detuned version of the supercharged 5.4L V8 engine from the SVT Lightning. In 2003, a 100th Anniversary Edition was produced for F-150 SuperCrew trucks.  For 2004, the Harley-Davidson option package became available for F-250/F-350 Super Duty trucks.  After 2008, the option package adopted many of the options featured from the Platinum trim level, featuring leather seating produced from materials reserved for Harley-Davidson biker jackets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29845 |title=New 2010 Ford Harley-Davidson F-150: tough truck with cool attitude; new details, inside and out |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=February 10, 2009 |access-date=April 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416055311/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29845 |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nFor 2012, the Harley-Davidson Edition was replaced by the Limited trim level, retaining a monochromatic exterior appearance (shifting past motorcycle-themed trim).\n\n=== SVT/Ford Raptor (2010-2014; 2017-present) ===\n[[File:Ford F-150 Raptor SVT - blue front.jpg|thumb|F-150 SVT Raptor]]For 2010, Ford introduced its second high-performance truck, the [[Ford F-Series twelfth generation#Ford SVT Raptor|SVT Raptor]]. In contrast to the enhanced on-road performance of the SVT Lightning, the SVT Raptor is a focused towards off-road use, in line with that of a [[Baja 1000]] racing truck. While a road-legal vehicle, many design modifications of the Raptor were made to improve its off-road capability, with the vehicle featuring a model-exclusive suspension with long-travel springs and shocks. The Raptor shares only its cab with a standard F-150; to accommodate its larger tires, the Raptor is fitted with wider front fenders, hood, and pickup bed. Initially produced as a SuperCab, a Raptor SuperCrew was introduced late in the 2010 model year. For the first time on a Ford vehicle in North America since 1983, the word \"Ford\" was spelled across the grille of the SVT Raptor in place of the Ford Blue Oval badge.\n\nFor 2010, the SVT Raptor was powered by a 310&nbsp;hp 5.4L V8; a 411&nbsp;hp 6.2L V8 (from the F-150 Platinum and Super Duty trucks) became optional, replacing the 5.4L V8 for 2011. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission paired with both engines.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the second-generation Ford Raptor (the SVT prefix was removed) was introduced for the 2017 model year. Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|thirteenth-generation F-Series]], the Ford Raptor shifted to an aluminum body. Again produced as a high-performance off-road vehicle, the Raptor is produced in SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations, with long-travel suspension specific to the vehicle. As a design theme, the second-generation Raptor does not carry a Ford Blue Oval grille badge, instead spelling out \"Ford\" across the grille.\n\nTo improve fuel economy and reduce weight, the 6.2L V8 was replaced by a 450 Horsepower and 510 Ft-Lbs torque High Output 3.5L twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lingeman|first1=Jake|date=February 6, 2017|title=Molehills out of Mountains|journal=[[Autoweek]]|pages=20\u201322}}</ref>\n\nFor 2019, Ford made upgrades to enhance the off-road capability of the Raptor series truck line. They introduced new FOX Live Valve Shocks. The new shocks auto adjust the suspension's compression dampening based on the terrain via a live sensor electrically controlled solenoid valves. This new Terrain Management System works with sensors in the body to adjust as the truck is driving. The new Trail control for 2019 also adds adaptive cruise control for off-road use.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2019/07/15/ford-raptor-romps-off-road/}}</ref>\n\nFord also added an optional Blue Accent Package with RECARO\u00ae front racing seats for the 2019 model year.\n\n=== F-150 King Ranch (2001-present) ===\nIn 2001, Ford's marketing department leveraged a partnership with the 825,000-acre [[King Ranch]] in south Texas, naming the most upscale model in the F-150 lineup after the ranch, which is one of the largest ranches in the United States and which operates a large fleet of Ford trucks.  The truck was emblazoned with the King Ranch's Running W brand and upholstered in saddle leather.  It was the industry's first full-size lightweight pickup truck with a full rear passenger compartment and 4 full-size doors, becoming the SuperCrew cab.  Along with the Limited and Platinum, the King Ranch continues to comprise the luxury end of the F-150 spectrum.  Unsurprisingly, 40% of King Ranch F-150 sales are in Texas, Ford's largest pickup truck market.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blueovaltrucks.com/ford_articles/history-of-the-ford-king-ranch/}}</ref>\n\n=== F-150 Platinum (2009-present) ===\n[[File:Platinum 2009.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 Platinum]]\n\nIntroduced for 2009, Platinum is a luxury-oriented trim of the Ford F-150. Effectively replacing the [[Lincoln Mark LT]] in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122468|title=RIP: Lincoln Mark LT|authorlink=Inside Line|date=September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033620/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D122468|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> (though its production continued through 2014 in Mexico), the Platinum adopted many of the luxury features and content from the Mark LT with more subdued exterior styling (the Platinum was fitted with an eggcrate grille similar to early models of the Ford Expedition).\n\nIn 2013, Ford began use of the Platinum trim  for Super Duty trucks, from the F-250 to the F-450 pickup trucks. Until 2016, the Platinum trim was an add-on package to a Super Duty that was ordered as a Lariat. 2017 saw the Platinum become a separate trim level.\n\n=== F-150 Tremor (2014) ===\nFor the 2014 model year, Ford introduced the Tremor model of the F-150. The Tremor was released as a high-performance sport truck for street truck enthusiasts. The regular-cab Tremor is based on the style of the FX Appearance Package with the 3.5 Liter EcoBoost engine and a 4.10 rear axle. The interior uses a console-mounted shifter, custom bucket seats and a flow-through center console not found in any other F-150. The Tremor is available in both 4x2 and 4x4. Both options feature an electronic locking rear differential and customized suspension. There were 2,230 Tremors built.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n== Ford F-150 Electric Pickup ==\nAt the 2019 [[Detroit Auto Show]] in January 2019, Ford announced the intention to produce an F-150 Electric Pickup, a [[battery electric vehicle|fully-electric]] light pickup.

Beginning in 1948 with the 1\u00bd ton F-5 (later F-500), the medium-duty trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800).  Prior to the 1957 introduction of the [[Ford C-Series]] tilt-cab, the medium-duty range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the fifth-generation F-Series in 1967, the medium-duty trucks were designed separately from the pickup truck range.  Although remaining part of the F-Series range, the medium-duty trucks shared only the cab and interior with the F-Series pickup trucks.  Since 1967, the cab design has changed only in 1980 and in 2000.  Redesigned on an all-new chassis, the 2017 F-Series medium-duty trucks retain an updated version of the 2000-2016 F-650/F750 cab.\n\nThe medium-duty F-Series served as the donor platform for the [[Ford B-Series|B-Series]] cowled bus chassis produced from 1948 to 1998. Produced primarily for school bus bodies, the B-Series was discontinued as part of the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner in 1996.\n\n=== Heavy-duty trucks ===\nAbove its medium-duty truck ranges, the Ford F-Series was used as a heavy-truck chassis during its early production.  In 1951, Ford debuted its \"Big Job\" line, denoting the F-8 conventional.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-trucks2.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Trucks|date=2007-06-20|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}</ref>  In 1958, the \"Super Duty\" and \"Extra Heavy Duty\" replaced the Big Job trucks, marking the debut of the [[Ford Super Duty engine|Super Duty V8]] engine line.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-trucks9.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Trucks|date=2007-06-20|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}</ref>  In 1963, the N-Series became the first short-hood conventional built by Ford, replacing the F-900 Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty.   Although based on an all-new chassis and separate bodywork, the cab was sourced from the F-Series.\n\nIn 1970, Ford introduced the [[Ford L-Series|L-Series \"Louisville\"]] line of conventional trucks, moving all heavy truck development away from the F-Series.  The L-Series/Aeromax would remain in production through 1998, as Ford exited the North American heavy-truck segment. Outside North America, Ford builds the [[Ford Cargo]], and [[Ford F-MAX]].\n\n=== Vans ===\n[[File:1956 Ford F100 Panel Truck (16301572198).jpg|thumb|1956 Ford F-100 panel van]]\nFrom 1948 until 1960, the F-Series was produced in a [[panel van]] configuration; in contrast to General Motors, Ford never offered a passenger \"carryall\" variant (competing against the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevrolet/GMC Suburban]] or the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).  For 1961, the panel van was discontinued, largely replaced by the [[Ford E-Series|Econoline]] [[compact van]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nFrom 1968 to the present day,<!-- still? in late 2019? if so, we ought to be able to find a source for it --> the Econoline/Club Wagon/E-Series vans have shared a degree of mechanical commonality with the F-Series pickup trucks (during the 1970s, some body components were shared).  While no longer produced for retail sale, the E-Series still shares its engines and transmission with the Ford Super Duty trucks.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Export ===\n[[File:Ford V8 Freighter F-100.jpg|thumb|This 1955 Australian F-100 Freighter had special high side panels, perhaps unique to Australia; note the right-hand drive.]]\n\nAs of 2018, outside of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the Ford F-150 is officially sold in most [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Caribbean|Caribbean countries]] (except Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Cuba), Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), Iceland, China, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, the Dutch territories of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Saint Maarten and the [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] of the Cayman Islands. The [[Special Vehicle Team|SVT]] Raptor is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), China, Ecuador, Chile and Peru. Both are available in LHD only.\n\nIn Mexico, the F-150 (XLT and higher trim levels) is called the \"Ford Lobo\" (Ford Wolf) while the F-150 SVT Raptor is called the \"Ford Lobo Raptor\". The F-150 XL remains as F-150 XL.\n\nThere is a strong [[Parallel import|grey market]] presence of Ford F-Series trucks around the world, most notably in Europe, China, and Australia, and usually driven by wealthy car enthusiasts, as the higher end trim models are the most sought-after versions.\n\nIn Bolivia, Ford F-series truck are imported from the United States. F-150 single, super cab and crew cab are available with short and long bed. F-series Heavy Duty like F-250, F-350 are available in Super Cab and Crew cab with long bed, but the F-450 is available only in a chassis version. The F-150 Raptor is available, too.\n\nIn Australia, Ford F-series trucks are imported and converted to right-hand drive by several Australian importers, mostly by the Harrison Motoring Group, which as become the largest importer of F-Series vehicles in the Southern Hemisphere. Harrison F-Trucks have become Australia's number one converter and supplier of the famous Ford F-Series badges.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most imported Ford F-Series trucks are the F-150 model, and usually the higher-end four door versions.\n\nRight-hand drive versions of the F-Series for the United Kingdom and Australia were manufactured in Brazil.\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the [[Gasoline|petrol]] engines are often converted to also run with alternative fuels, E-96h (Brazilian-spec ethanol) and compressed natural gas (CNG). Biodiesel also is used in Diesel engines.{{Citation needed|reason=As of the 2010s, so-called \"FlexFuel\" vehicles are commonly sold in the United States that can run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol, making them suitable for markets like Brazil.  This is no longer a distinguishing special feature, but standard with electronic fuel injection systems.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe addition of the 3.0l V6 turbo diesel engine could potentially make the Ford F-150 go global and in both LHD and RHD from the factory.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ford Super Duty]]\n*[[Ford F-series (medium duty truck)|Ford F-Series (medium duty)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Ford F-Series}}\n* [https://www.ford.com/new-trucks/ Official site]\n* [https://insideevs.com/news/361332/video-ford-f150-electric-tows-million-pounds/ Ford F-150 electric prototype tows 1.25 million pounds], video, July 2019.\n{{Ford F-Series}}{{Ford vehicles}}\n{{Early Ford trucks}}\n{{Ford trucks of the United States & Canada 1980 to present}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ford F-Series|F-Series]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1948]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the 1999\u2013present F-250 and higher models|Ford Super Duty}}\n{{redirect|F150|other uses}}\n{{redirect|Ford F1|Ford factory Formula One racing efforts|Stewart Grand Prix}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Ford F-Series\n| image = Ford-f150-2015-fx4-por-jesus.jpg\n| caption = Ford F-150, thirteenth generation\n| manufacturer = [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]\n| aka = Ford Lobo (Mexico, 1992\u2013present)\n| production = 1948\u2013present\n| class = Full-size [[pickup truck]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| predecessor = [[1941 Ford|1941\u20131948 Ford pickup]]\n| successor = [[Ford Super Duty]] (F-250, F-350, F-450, F-550, F-650, F-750)\n}}\n\nThe '''Ford F-Series''' is a series of trucks marketed and manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].

From 1948 to 1968, Mercury marketed the F-Series as the [[Mercury M-Series|M-Series]] (in Canada); during the 2000s, Lincoln sold the F-150 as the [[Lincoln Blackwood|Blackwood]] and the later [[Lincoln Mark LT|Mark LT]]. The F-series platform has underpinned several sport utility vehicles, including the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Ford Expedition]] and [[Lincoln Navigator]].\n\nAs of current production, the Ford F-Series is manufactured by Ford in four facilities in the United States.   \n\n== First generation (1948\u20131952) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (first generation)}}\n[[File:1950 Ford F3.jpg|thumb|1950 F-3]]\n\nThe first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was introduced in 1948 as a replacement for the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, cab-over engine (COE), conventional truck, and school bus chassis body styles.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1953\u20131956) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (second generation)}}\n[[File:1954 Ford F-100 Red.jpg|thumb|1953 F-100]]\n\nFor the 1953 model year, Ford introduced a second generation of the F-Series trucks. Increased dimensions, improved engines, and an updated chassis were features of the second generation.  In another change, the model nomenclature of the F-Series was expanded to three numbers; this remains in use in the present day.  The half-ton F-1 became the F-100 (partially influenced by the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}; the F-2 and F-3 were combined into the {{3/4}}-ton F-250 while the F-4 became the one-ton F-350.  Conventional F-Series trucks were F-500 to F-900; COE chassis were renamed C-Series trucks.\n\nWhile the cabs, doors, radiator support, inner fenders and hoods are the same from 1953-1956 F-100 & F-250s (the fenders varied on F-250, F-350, F-500 and long boxes were only available on F-250), in 1956 the cab underwent a major revision.  Centered around a wraparound windshield, the cab was given new doors, a redesigned dashboard, and an (optional) panoramic rear window.  In line with Ford cars, the 1956 F-Series offered seat belts as an option.\n\n[[File:1953 F100 Diagram.jpg|thumb|center|1953 F100 Build Diagram]]{{clear}}\n\n== Third generation (1957\u20131960) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (third generation)}}\n[[File:1960 Ford F-500 stake truck black fr.jpg|thumb|1960 F-500]]\n\nIntroduced in 1957, the third generation F-series was a significant modernization and redesign. Front fenders became integrated into the body, and the new Styleside bed continued the smooth lines to the rear of the pickup.\n\nThe cab-over F-Series was discontinued, having been replaced by the tilt-cab [[Ford C-Series|C-Series]].\n\nIn 1959, Ford began in-house production of four-wheel-drive pickups.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1961\u20131966) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (fourth generation)}}\n[[File:1965 Ford F100 Pick Up.jpg|thumb|1965 F-100]]\n\nFord introduced a dramatically new style of pickup in 1961 with the fourth generation F-Series. Longer and lower than its predecessors, these trucks had increased dimensions and new engine and gearbox choices. Additionally, the 1961\u20131963 models offered an optional unibody design with the cab and bed integrated.  The traditional separate cab/bed was offered concurrently.  The unibody proved unpopular, and Ford discontinued the option after the 1963 model year.\n\nIn 1965, the F-Series was given a significant mid-cycle redesign. A completely new platform, including the \"[[Swing axle#Twin I-Beam|Twin I-Beam]]\" front suspension, was introduced that would be used until 1996 on the F-150 and until 2016 on the F-250/350 4x2. Additionally that year, the Ranger name made its first appearance on a Ford pickup; previously a base model of the Edsel, it was now used to denote a high-level styling package for F-Series pickups.<ref>This F-series Ranger is distinct from compact [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] series of pickup trucks introduced in 1983 for North America, although the latter used technology from the full-size trucks, such as the Twin I-Beam front suspension on two-wheel-drive models and Twin Traction Beam suspension on four-wheel-drive.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation (1967\u20131972) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (fifth generation)}}\n[[File:1972 Ford F-250 Camper Special pickup.jpg|thumb|1972 F-250 camper special ]]\n\nIntroduced in 1967, the fifth generation F-series pickup was built on the same platform as the 1965 revision of the fourth generation. Dimensions and greenhouse glass were increased, engine options expanded, and plusher trim levels became available during the fifth generation's production run.\n\nSuspension components from all 1969 F-Series models are completely interchangeable.\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1973\u20131979) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (sixth generation)}}\n[[File:Ford F-250 Ranger.jpg|thumb|1979 F-250 Ranger]]\n\nThe sixth generation F-series was introduced in 1973. This version of the F-series continued to be built on the 1965 fourth generation's revised platform, but with significant modernization and refinements, including front disc brakes, increased cabin dimensions, full double wall bed construction and increased use of galvanized steel.\n\nThe FE engine series was discontinued in 1976 after a nearly 20-year run, replaced by the more modern 335 & 385 series engines.\n\nIn 1975, the F-150 was introduced in between the F-100 and the F-250 in order to avoid certain emission control restrictions. For 1978, square headlights replaced the previous models' round ones on higher trim package models, such as Lariat and Ranger, and in 1979 became standard equipment. Also for 1978, the Ford Bronco was redesigned into a variant of the F-series pickup. 1979 was the last year that the 460 engine was available in a half ton truck.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1980\u20131986) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (seventh generation)}}\n[[File:7th-Ford-F150.jpg|thumb|F-150 XL]]\n\nThe 1980 F-Series was designed with an all-new chassis and larger body; this was the first ground-up redesign since 1965. The exterior styling of the truck was redone to improve aerodynamics and fuel economy. Medium-duty F-Series (F600-F900) were also redesigned; although they shared the cabin of the smaller pickup trucks, the largest version of F-Series now wore a bonnet with separate front wings (like the [[Ford L-Series Trucks|L-Series]]). Medium duty Ford F-Series would carry the 1980\u20131986 interior design until 2000 (though pickups were restyled again in 1987 and 1992), with very subtle changes such as window glass and electronics.\n\nIn a move toward fuel efficiency, Ford dropped the M-Series engines (the 5.8 Liter ''351M'' and 6.6 Liter 400&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8s) in 1981, replacing them with the 4.2 Liter 255 C.I. and 5.8 Liter 351 C.I. [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor V8]] engines from the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]]. The 255 V8 was simply a 5.0L, 302 V8 with a smaller bore, built specifically for better fuel economy, but was dropped for the 1982 model year due to being underpowered and having limited demand. For 1982 and 1983, the 3.8L, 232 C.I. Essex V6 was the base engine but was quickly dropped for the 1984 model year. In 1983, Ford added Diesel power to the F-Series through a partnership with [[International Harvester]] (later [[Navistar]]). The 6.9L, 420 C.I. IDI V8 produced similar power output as the gasoline 351 Windsor V8, with the fuel economy of the 4.9L, 300 cubic inch I6. From this point on (1983\u2013present), the heavier duty f-series trucks (F-350 and above) were usually equipped with Diesel engines. 1985 was the first year of electronic fuel injection on the 5.0L V8, all other engines following suit in 1988. There was a new \"high output\" version of the 5.8L Windsor beginning in 1984.\n\nA noticeable change was made to the F-Series in 1982 as the Ford \"Blue Oval\" was added to the center of the grill, also the Ranger and Custom trims were no longer available. The Ranger name had been shifted onto the all-new compact pickup developed as a replacement for the Courier. The new trim levels were a no-badge base model (essentially the new Custom), XL, a very rare XLS, and XLT Lariat.\n\n1983 marked the final year of the F-100, making the F-150 the lightest pickup available on the market. F-100s and F-150s were virtually identical with the exception of smaller brakes. F-100s over a certain GVWR and/or without power brakes did use the F-150 axles. Also, the 1980\u20131983 F-100 was never offered with four-wheel-drive.\n\n1986 marked the final year that the F-150 was available with a 3-speed manual gearbox that shifted via a steering column lever (3-on-the-tree). Incidentally, this was the second-to-last vehicle in the United States to offer this set up. 1986 was also the last year the Explorer package was available.\n\nThis is the first generation of trucks to incorporate amenities such as power mirrors, power windows, and power door locks.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (1987\u20131991) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (eighth generation)}}\n[[File:Ford F-150 -- 09-07-2009.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 (light-duty type)]]\n\nThe 1987 F-Series carried over the same body style from the seventh generation, yet sported a new rounded front clip that improved aerodynamics, as well as the softening of body lines around the rear of the bed and fender arches around the wheel wells. The interior was also completely redesigned in 1987. The transmissions available on SuperCab models were a four-speed or five-speed manual; regular cab models were also available with automatic transmission. The Custom trim made a comeback for the eighth generation. In 1988, the 4.9 Liter inline-six, 5.8 Liter V8, and 7.5 Liter V8 engines gained electronic fuel injection. International Navistar also increased the displacement of their 6.9 Liter V8 in the same year, resulting in the new 7.3 Liter unit. This was also the first year of a five-speed manual overdrive transmission, which included the Mazda ''M5OD'' in the F-150s and the heavy-duty ZF5 in the F-250s and F-350s. Four-speed manuals were discontinued as standard equipment after 1987, but were available as a customer-ordered option until 1989. In 1989, the C6 three-speed automatic was replaced as the base automatic transmission with the ''E4OD'', a four-speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive unit, though the C6 was still available as an option, mostly in F-250s and F-350s, until 1997. Heavy-Duty models included F-250s and F-350s (along with F-Super Dutys) that were classified as incomplete vehicles only that were produced with no bed, but appeared as [[tow truck]]s, box trucks (notably [[U-Haul]]), flatbed trucks, [[dump truck]]s and other models..\n\n== Ninth generation (1992\u20131997) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (ninth generation)}}\n[[File:1993 F-150 with dual gas tanks.jpg|thumb|1993 Ford F-150, with dual fuel tanks]]\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the body-shell of the 1980 F-Series was given another major upgrade. To further improve its aerodynamics, the forward bodywork was given a slightly lower hoodline, rounding the front fenders and grille; in addition, the changes matched the F-Series with the design of the newly introduced Explorer and redesigned E-Series and Ranger. Along with the exterior updates, the interior received a complete redesign.\n\nLast used in 1987, the FlareSide bed made its return as an option for 1992. To appeal to younger buyers, the bed bodywork was redesigned. Borrowing the sides of a dual rear wheel F-350 and molding them to a narrowed F-150 bed a FlairSide bed was created.\n\nTo commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first Ford factory-produced truck (the 1917 [[Ford Model TT]]), Ford offered a 75th anniversary package on its 1992 F-series, consisting of a stripe package, an argent colored step bumper, and special 75th anniversary logos. In 1993, the 240&nbsp;hp SVT Lightning was introduced as a specially-tuned performance truck; over 11,000 were built from 1993 to 1995.\n\nIn a trim shift, the XLT Lariat was dropped and combined with the XLT; the XL took over for the Custom trim after 1993 (marking the last usage of the Custom nameplate by Ford). In 1995, the Eddie Bauer trim made its return.\n\nIn 1994.5 model year the 7.3L Indirect injected (IDI) was replaced instead with International/Navistar's t444e 445 C.I (275Hp,550Tq which Ford badged as its powerstroke turbo diesel the 7.3 liter powerstroke only kept the same displacement, bore size, and stroke length from the IDI motor.\n\nIn 1995, the medium-duty Ford F-Series (F-600 through F-800 and all Ford B-Series) were given their first update since 1980. All versions (except severe-service) received a hood redesign which enlarged the grille and moved the turn signal indicators to the outside of the front headlights.\n\nDuring the second half of 1997, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350. The body style stayed the same until the end of 1997. The only change of the F-250 HD and F-350 was that they no longer has classic style tailgates, with the stainless steel cap on them which read FORD. Instead the tailgate had the '''F-250 Heavy Duty'''/'''F-350''' nameplate labeled on its left side, while Ford's blue oval was labeled on The right side (similarly styled like the 1997 Ford F-150 around this same time). The F-250 HD also had some minor changes in trim location, and options available. The 1997 F-250 HD with the 7.3 Powerstroke Diesel is also the rarest and most desirable of ninth generation Fords.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the tenth-generation F-150, the F-250 and F-350 continued into production into the 1998 model year, becoming part of the [[Ford Super Duty|Ford F-Series Super Duty]] line as they were replaced in 1999.\n\n== Tenth generation (1997\u20132004) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (tenth generation)}}\n[[File:'97-'98 Ford F-250 XL Regular Cab.JPG|thumb|1999-2000 F-250 XL]]\n\nFor 1997, Ford Motor Company made a major change to its F-Series family of trucks as the F-Series pickup line was essentially split in two. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, buyers of pickup trucks had increasingly purchased the vehicles for the purposes of personal use over work use. To further increase its growing market share, Ford sought to develop vehicles for both types of buyers. In its ultimate decision, the company decided to make the F-150 as a contemporary vehicle for personal use, while the F-250 and F-350 would be designed more conservatively for work-based customers.\n\nIntroduced in early 1996 as a 1997 model, the F-150 was a completely new vehicle in comparison from its predecessor. Similar to the original Ford Taurus of 1986, the 1997 F-150 was developed with a radically streamlined body. Dispensing with the traditional Twin I-Beam for a fully independent front suspension, the all-new chassis only shared the transmissions with the previous generation. In a major change, the long-running 4.9L inline-6 was replaced by a 4.2&nbsp;L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#4.2|Essex]] V6 engine as standard. The 4.6&nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#4.6|Modular]] V8 shared with the Panther Car was optional (with a bigger 5.4&nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4|Triton]] V8 version added in mid-1997). Originally developed for use in the F-Series, the Modular/Triton V8 was the first overhead-camshaft engine ever to be installed in a full-size pickup truck.\n\nTo improve rear-seat access for SuperCab models, a rear-hinged (curb-side) door was added to all versions. Following its popularity, the SuperCab gained a fourth door for 1999. In 2001, the F-150 became the first pickup truck in its size segment to become available with four full-size doors from the factory. Sharing the length of a standard-bed SuperCab, the F-150 SuperCrew was produced with a slightly shortened bed.\n\nDuring the second half of the 1997 model year, Ford introduced a heavier GVWR version (7700 GVWR) bearing the F-250 name. It was distinguished by a unique seven-lug bolt pattern for the wheels. At the same time, the F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350 (same square body style as the last generation F-150; it was still built in [[South America]] only). Due the Super Duty trucks never reaching Ford dealerships as for sale until the beginning of 1999, Ford produced a lighter duty F-250, using the same body the F-150 had at the time as a temporarily model (1997 to 1999). By February 1999, the  light duty F-250 was replaced by the F-150 7700-pound GVWR package, leaving the F-250 Super Duty as the only model using the name.\n\nIn 1999, the SVT Lightning made its return, with an Eaton supercharger increasing the 5.4&nbsp;L V8's output to 360&nbsp;hp (380&nbsp;hp for 2001 onward); over 28,000 were produced from 1999 to 2004. For 2002, Lincoln-Mercury gained its first full-size pickup truck since 1968 with the introduction of the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first Lincoln pickup. Sharing the front bodywork of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV and the same cab body work as the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150]], the Blackwood was designed with a model-exclusive bed and was sold only in black. Due to very poor sales, the Blackwood was discontinued after 2002.\n\nIn 1999, the F-250 and F-350 pickups were introduced as the 1999 [[Ford Super Duty|Ford F-Series Super Duty]] model line. While remaining part of the F-Series, the Super Duty trucks use a different platform architecture, powertrain, and design language, primarily as they are intended for heavy-duty work use. Designed in a joint venture with [[Navistar International]], the medium-duty [[Ford F-650|F-650/F-750 Super Duty]] were introduced in 2000.\n\nThis generation of F-150 continued production in 2004 alongside the all-new F-150 as the F-150 Heritage.\n\n== Eleventh generation (2004\u20132008) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)}}\n[[File:Ford F150 FX4 2004.jpg|thumb|2004 F-150 FX4]]\n\nFor the 2004 model year, the F-150 was redesigned on [[Ford P platform#P2|an all-new platform]]. The new platform starts off with a fully boxed in frame and introduced rear shocks to mount outside of the frame for decreased wheel hop and improved ride quality. This new body style kept the fully independent front suspension introduced in the last generation but added vacuum driven front wheel hubs for the 4 wheel drive versions.  The previous generation had full time connected front axles.  The improvement saves fuel and by default goes into a wheel locked position. Should a failure occur in the vacuum solenoid, system, or hoses the wheel hub default to a 4wd position to keep from leaving a driver stranded.  Internally, a 3-valve version of the 5.4 Liter V8 was introduced and replaced the previous 2-valve version. Externally, the eleventh-generation model was different from its predecessor, with sharper-edged styling; a major change was the adoption of the stepped driver's window from the Super Duty trucks. Regardless of cab type, all F-150s were given four doors, with the rear doors on the regular cab providing access to behind-the-seat storage. Ford also introduced additional variants of the F-150. The FX4 Off-Road package available since the 2002 model year became its own trim level. A sportier version of the F-150 became available as STX, replaced by FX2 Sport in 2007.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Lincoln-Mercury dealers sold this version of the F-150 as the [[Lincoln Mark LT]], replacing the Blackwood.\n\nIn late 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Super Duty trucks were given an [[Ford P platform#P3|all-new platform]]. While using the same bed and cabin as before, these are distinguished from their predecessors by an all-new interior and a much larger grille and [[head lamp]]s. Previously available only as a chassis-cab model, the F-450 now was available as a pickup directly from Ford.<ref>{{citation |title=Ford F-150 \u2013 Boosting The EcoBoost |work=Truckin Magazine |first=Barry |last=Cluczyk |date=December 2012}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n== Twelfth generation (2009\u20132014) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (twelfth generation)}}\n[[File:2009 Ford F-150 XLT SuperCrew.jpg|thumb|2009 F-150 XLT SuperCrew]]\n\nThe twelfth generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year as an update of the [[Ford P platform#P415|Ford full-size truck platform]]. Similar to its predecessor, these trucks are distinguished by their Super Duty-style grilles and head lamps; standard cab models again have two-doors instead of four. The FlareSide bed was continued until 2010, dropped along with the manual gearbox; outside of Mexico, the Lincoln Mark LT was replaced by the F-150 Platinum. A new model for 2010 included the SVT Raptor, a dedicated off-road pickup.\n\nIn 2010 Ford shifted its electronics from a GEM (General electric module) based to the computerized and programmable BCM (Body Control Module) Allowing for fewer parts differences and programmable upgrade options from the dealer or factory.  In 2011 Ford reintroduced the 5.0 in the F series with its new 5.0 Coyote dual over head cam TiVVT engine with 360hp.\n\nAs part of a major focus on fuel economy, the entire engine lineup for the F-150 was updated for the 2011 model year. Along with the new V8 engine, the F-150 gained a new 3.7 Liter base V6 engine, and a powerful twin-turbocharged 3.5 Liter V6, dubbed [[Ford EcoBoost engine#EcoBoost V6|EcoBoost]] by Ford. An automatic transmission is the only option. Other modifications include the addition of a [[Nexteer Automotive]] [[Power steering|Electric Power Steering]] (EPS) system on most models.\n\nA recent study conducted by [[iSeeCars.com]] and published on the Ford Motor Company website listed the Ford F-250 Super Duty as the longest-lasting vehicle and Expedition, Explorer and F-150 among the top 20 longest-lasting vehicles.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://social.ford.com/our-articles/suvs/expedition/five-ford-vehicles-made-the-200000-mile-list/ |title=Five Ford Vehicles Made the 200,000-Mile List |publisher=Ford.com |access-date=May 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530023147/http://social.ford.com/our-articles/suvs/expedition/five-ford-vehicles-made-the-200000-mile-list/ |archivedate=May 30, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Thirteenth generation (2015\u2013present) ==\n{{Main|Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)}}\n[[File:2018 Ford F-150 XLT front (2) 5.19.18.jpg|thumb|2018 F-150 XLT SuperCab]]\n\nThe thirteenth-generation Ford F-Series was introduced for the 2015 model year.  Largely previewed by the [[Ford Atlas]] concept vehicle at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the new design marked several extensive changes to the F-Series design.  In the interest of fuel economy, Ford designers reduced curb weight of the F-150 by nearly 750 pounds, without physically altering its exterior footprint.  To allow for such a massive weight reduction, nearly every body panel was switched from steel to aluminum (with the exception of the firewall); the frame itself remains high-strength steel.<ref name=\"2015 F150 Autoblog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/13/2015-ford-f-150-detroit-2014/|title=2015 Ford F-150 brings big aluminum to the Rust Belt [w/video]|author=Korzeniewski, Jeremy|date=January 13, 2014|access-date=January 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"motortrend.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1401_2015_ford_f_150_first_look/|title=2015 Ford F-150 First Look - Motor Trend|date=January 12, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  To prove the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, during the development of the thirteenth-generation F-Series, Ford entered camouflaged prototypes into the Baja 1000 endurance race (where the vehicles finished).

While these variants primarily consist of trim packages, others are high-performance versions while other variants were designed with various means of improving functionality.\n\n=== Unibody F-Series (1961-1963) ===\nFor 1961 into part of the 1963 model year, the Ford F-Series was offered with a third body configuration, integrating the Styleside bed with the cab. With the pickup bed stampings welded directly to the cab before both assemblies were mounted to the frame, the design simplified the assembly and paint process (the configuration was similar to that of the [[Ford Ranchero]]).  Following a poor market reception, the unibody pickup bed design was withdrawn during the 1963 model year.\n\n=== Specials (1961-1979) ===\nFrom 1961 to 1979, Ford offered several ''Special'' option packages for the F-Series, typically designed for owners with specific uses for their vehicles.  For 1961, the ''Camper Special'' option package was introduced; designed for owners of [[Truck camper|slide-in truck campers]], the option package featured pre-wiring for the camper, heavy-duty transmission and engine cooling, and a larger alternator.  For 1968, Ford introduced the ''Contractor's Special'', and ''Farm and Ranch Special'', which featured toolboxes and heavier-duty suspension.  The ''Explorer Special'' was introduced as a lower-priced variant of the Ranger trim. The \"Trailer Special\" was offered as well with trailer brake, heavy-duty radiator, transmission cooler, and tow hitch.\n\nIn 1980, the Special option packages were withdrawn as part of the F-Series redesign, while a number of features continued as stand-alone options; the Explorer continued as a variant of the Ranger trim through the 1986 model year.\n\n=== F-150 Nite (1991-1992) ===\nSold from 1991 to 1992 on the Ford F-150 XLT Lariat, the Nite special edition was an monochromatic option package, featuring black paint and trim with a multicolor accent stripe. For 1991, it was exclusive to the regular-cab F-150; for 1992, it was available on all bodystyles of the F-150 and introduced on the Ford Bronco.\n\nThe Nite edition was available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive with either the 5.0L or 5.8L V8; it also included a sport suspension and alloy wheels on 235/75R15 white-letter tires.\n\n=== Eddie Bauer (1994-1996) ===\nFor 1994, Ford introduced the Eddie Bauer trim level for the F-150. In a fashion similar to the same trim packages on the Aerostar, Bronco, and Explorer/Bronco II, it consisted of outdoors-themed interior trim with two-tone exterior paint.\n\n=== SVT Lightning (1993-1995; 1999-2004) ===\n{{Main|Ford_F-Series_tenth_generation#SVT_Lightning|l1=Ford SVT Lightning}}\n[[File:1993FordLightning.jpg|thumb|1993 Ford SVT Lightning]]\n[[File:Ford-F150-Lightning.jpg|thumb|Second-generation Ford SVT Lightning]]\n\nIntroduced as a 1993 model, the Ford SVT Lightning is a [[Performance car|high-performance version]] of the F-150 that was produced by the Ford Special Vehicle Team ([[Ford SVT|SVT]]).  Intended as a competitor for the [[Chevrolet 454 SS|Chevrolet 454SS]], the SVT Lightning was derived from the F-150; to improve its handling, extensive modifications were made to the front and rear suspension and frame.  Powered by a 240&nbsp;hp version of the 5.8L V8, the Lightning used a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic transmission from the F-350 (normally paired with the 7.5L V8 or 7.3L diesel V8).  While slower in acceleration than the [[GMC Syclone]], the Lightning retained nearly all of the towing and payload capacity of a standard Ford F-150.  Produced from 1993 to 1995, the first-generation SVT Lightning was withdrawn as Ford readied the 1997 Ford F-150 for sale.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Ford released a second generation of the SVT Lightning for the 1999 model year.  In line with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the second-generation Lightning was based on the F-150 with a number of suspension modifications; in a design change, all examples were produced with a FlareSide bed.  In place of a model-specific engine, the second-generation was powered by a supercharged version of the 5.4L V8 from the F-150, producing 360&nbsp;hp (increased to 380&nbsp;hp in 2001).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=Hunting |title=Ford SVT Lightning Perfected the Modern Muscle Truck Formula |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/ford-svt-lightning-perfected-the-modern-muscle-truck-formula/ |website=Driving Line |publisher=Nitto Tire |accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>  As before, the higher-output engine was paired with a heavier-duty transmission from the F-350 pickup.\n\nFor the 2004 redesign of the Ford F-150, the SVT Lightning was not included, leaving 2004 as the final year for the model line.  While of an entirely different design focus from the SVT Lightning, the SVT/Ford Raptor is the succeeding generation of high-performance Ford F-Series pickup trucks.\n\n=== Harley-Davidson Edition (2000-2011) ===\nFrom 2000 to 2011, the [[Harley-Davidson]] Edition was an option package available on the F-150.  Primarily an appearance package featuring monochromatic black trim, from 2002 to 2003, the edition included a slightly detuned version of the supercharged 5.4L V8 engine from the SVT Lightning. In 2003, a 100th Anniversary Edition was produced for F-150 SuperCrew trucks.  For 2004, the Harley-Davidson option package became available for F-250/F-350 Super Duty trucks.  After 2008, the option package adopted many of the options featured from the Platinum trim level, featuring leather seating produced from materials reserved for Harley-Davidson biker jackets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29845 |title=New 2010 Ford Harley-Davidson F-150: tough truck with cool attitude; new details, inside and out |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=February 10, 2009 |access-date=April 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416055311/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29845 |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nFor 2012, the Harley-Davidson Edition was replaced by the Limited trim level, retaining a monochromatic exterior appearance (shifting past motorcycle-themed trim).\n\n=== SVT/Ford Raptor (2010-2014; 2017-present) ===\n[[File:Ford F-150 Raptor SVT - blue front.jpg|thumb|F-150 SVT Raptor]]For 2010, Ford introduced its second high-performance truck, the [[Ford F-Series twelfth generation#Ford SVT Raptor|SVT Raptor]]. In contrast to the enhanced on-road performance of the SVT Lightning, the SVT Raptor is a focused towards off-road use, in line with that of a [[Baja 1000]] racing truck. While a road-legal vehicle, many design modifications of the Raptor were made to improve its off-road capability, with the vehicle featuring a model-exclusive suspension with long-travel springs and shocks. The Raptor shares only its cab with a standard F-150; to accommodate its larger tires, the Raptor is fitted with wider front fenders, hood, and pickup bed. Initially produced as a SuperCab, a Raptor SuperCrew was introduced late in the 2010 model year. For the first time on a Ford vehicle in North America since 1983, the word \"Ford\" was spelled across the grille of the SVT Raptor in place of the Ford Blue Oval badge.\n\nFor 2010, the SVT Raptor was powered by a 310&nbsp;hp 5.4L V8; a 411&nbsp;hp 6.2L V8 (from the F-150 Platinum and Super Duty trucks) became optional, replacing the 5.4L V8 for 2011. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission paired with both engines.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the second-generation Ford Raptor (the SVT prefix was removed) was introduced for the 2017 model year. Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|thirteenth-generation F-Series]], the Ford Raptor shifted to an aluminum body. Again produced as a high-performance off-road vehicle, the Raptor is produced in SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations, with long-travel suspension specific to the vehicle. As a design theme, the second-generation Raptor does not carry a Ford Blue Oval grille badge, instead spelling out \"Ford\" across the grille.\n\nTo improve fuel economy and reduce weight, the 6.2L V8 was replaced by a 450 Horsepower and 510 Ft-Lbs torque High Output 3.5L twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lingeman|first1=Jake|date=February 6, 2017|title=Molehills out of Mountains|journal=[[Autoweek]]|pages=20\u201322}}</ref>\n\nFor 2019, Ford made upgrades to enhance the off-road capability of the Raptor series truck line. They introduced new FOX Live Valve Shocks. The new shocks auto adjust the suspension's compression dampening based on the terrain via a live sensor electrically controlled solenoid valves. This new Terrain Management System works with sensors in the body to adjust as the truck is driving. The new Trail control for 2019 also adds adaptive cruise control for off-road use.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2019/07/15/ford-raptor-romps-off-road/}}</ref>\n\nFord also added an optional Blue Accent Package with RECARO\u00ae front racing seats for the 2019 model year.\n\n=== F-150 King Ranch (2001-present) ===\nIn 2001, Ford's marketing department leveraged a partnership with the 825,000-acre [[King Ranch]] in south Texas, naming the most upscale model in the F-150 lineup after the ranch, which is one of the largest ranches in the United States and which operates a large fleet of Ford trucks.  The truck was emblazoned with the King Ranch's Running W brand and upholstered in saddle leather.  It was the industry's first full-size lightweight pickup truck with a full rear passenger compartment and 4 full-size doors, becoming the SuperCrew cab.  Along with the Limited and Platinum, the King Ranch continues to comprise the luxury end of the F-150 spectrum.  Unsurprisingly, 40% of King Ranch F-150 sales are in Texas, Ford's largest pickup truck market.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blueovaltrucks.com/ford_articles/history-of-the-ford-king-ranch/}}</ref>\n\n=== F-150 Platinum (2009-present) ===\n[[File:Platinum 2009.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 Platinum]]\n\nIntroduced for 2009, Platinum is a luxury-oriented trim of the Ford F-150. Effectively replacing the [[Lincoln Mark LT]] in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122468|title=RIP: Lincoln Mark LT|authorlink=Inside Line|date=September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033620/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D122468|archivedate=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=September 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> (though its production continued through 2014 in Mexico), the Platinum adopted many of the luxury features and content from the Mark LT with more subdued exterior styling (the Platinum was fitted with an eggcrate grille similar to early models of the Ford Expedition).\n\nIn 2013, Ford began use of the Platinum trim  for Super Duty trucks, from the F-250 to the F-450 pickup trucks. Until 2016, the Platinum trim was an add-on package to a Super Duty that was ordered as a Lariat. 2017 saw the Platinum become a separate trim level.\n\n=== F-150 Tremor (2014) ===\nFor the 2014 model year, Ford introduced the Tremor model of the F-150. The Tremor was released as a high-performance sport truck for street truck enthusiasts. The regular-cab Tremor is based on the style of the FX Appearance Package with the 3.5 Liter EcoBoost engine and a 4.10 rear axle. The interior uses a console-mounted shifter, custom bucket seats and a flow-through center console not found in any other F-150. The Tremor is available in both 4x2 and 4x4. Both options feature an electronic locking rear differential and customized suspension. There were 2,230 Tremors built.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n== Ford F-150 Electric Pickup ==\nAt the 2019 [[Detroit Auto Show]] in January 2019, Ford announced the intention to produce an F-150 Electric Pickup, a [[battery electric vehicle|fully-electric]] light pickup.

Mead crossed the finish line in Buenos Aires and won the \"super production\" class, the first North American class win in Dakar history. Campillay was unable to finish the 12th stage after losing time due to mechanical failure during the 11th stage, which led to his disqualification for failing to reach the race camp by the designated deadline.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nThe Ford F-150 has won numerous awards; in 2009 alone, it received:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29579 |title=2009 FORD F-150 AWARDS |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=December 16, 2008 |access-date=October 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020808/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29579 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*''[[Motor Trend]]'' 2009 Truck of the Year Award\n* 2009 Best Redesigned Vehicle from Kelley Blue Book's kbb.com\n* Top honors as the \"truck of Texas\" as well as the \"best luxury pickup\" for the 2009 F-150 King Ranch from Texas Auto Writers Association\n* Automotive Excellence Award in the Workhorse Category from ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''\n* \"Top safety pick\" from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for its standard safety technology: safety canopy side curtain air bags and AdvanceTrac with roll stability control\n* Residual Value Award from Automotive Leasing Guide (ALG) for retaining the highest percentage of its original price among 2009 full-size light-duty pickups at the end of a conventional three-year lease, based on ALG projections\n*''[[Motor Trend]]''<nowiki/>'s Truck Trend Top 5 Pickups from Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) for 2009 Ford F-150 Heavy Duty DeWalt Contractor Concept\n* Accessory-Friendly Pickup Design Award from [[SEMA]]\n* \"Best overall half-ton pickup\" from PickupTrucks.com\n\n== Sales ==\nQuantities of Ford F-Series trucks sold\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Beginning in 1948 with the 1\u00bd ton F-5 (later F-500), the medium-duty trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800).  Prior to the 1957 introduction of the [[Ford C-Series]] tilt-cab, the medium-duty range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the fifth-generation F-Series in 1967, the medium-duty trucks were designed separately from the pickup truck range.  Although remaining part of the F-Series range, the medium-duty trucks shared only the cab and interior with the F-Series pickup trucks.  Since 1967, the cab design has changed only in 1980 and in 2000.  Redesigned on an all-new chassis, the 2017 F-Series medium-duty trucks retain an updated version of the 2000-2016 F-650/F750 cab.\n\nThe medium-duty F-Series served as the donor platform for the [[Ford B-Series|B-Series]] cowled bus chassis produced from 1948 to 1998. Produced primarily for school bus bodies, the B-Series was discontinued as part of the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner in 1996.\n\n=== Heavy-duty trucks ===\nAbove its medium-duty truck ranges, the Ford F-Series was used as a heavy-truck chassis during its early production.  In 1951, Ford debuted its \"Big Job\" line, denoting the F-8 conventional.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-trucks2.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Trucks|date=2007-06-20|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}</ref>  In 1958, the \"Super Duty\" and \"Extra Heavy Duty\" replaced the Big Job trucks, marking the debut of the [[Ford Super Duty engine|Super Duty V8]] engine line.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1959-ford-trucks9.htm|title=1950-1959 Ford Trucks|date=2007-06-20|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}</ref>  In 1963, the N-Series became the first short-hood conventional built by Ford, replacing the F-900 Super Duty/Extra Heavy Duty.   Although based on an all-new chassis and separate bodywork, the cab was sourced from the F-Series.\n\nIn 1970, Ford introduced the [[Ford L-Series|L-Series \"Louisville\"]] line of conventional trucks, moving all heavy truck development away from the F-Series.  The L-Series/Aeromax would remain in production through 1998, as Ford exited the North American heavy-truck segment. Outside North America, Ford builds the [[Ford Cargo]], and [[Ford F-MAX]].\n\n=== Vans ===\n[[File:1956 Ford F100 Panel Truck (16301572198).jpg|thumb|1956 Ford F-100 panel van]]\nFrom 1948 until 1960, the F-Series was produced in a [[panel van]] configuration; in contrast to General Motors, Ford never offered a passenger \"carryall\" variant (competing against the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevrolet/GMC Suburban]] or the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).  For 1961, the panel van was discontinued, largely replaced by the [[Ford E-Series|Econoline]] [[compact van]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nFrom 1968 to the present day,<!-- still? in late 2019? if so, we ought to be able to find a source for it --> the Econoline/Club Wagon/E-Series vans have shared a degree of mechanical commonality with the F-Series pickup trucks (during the 1970s, some body components were shared).  While no longer produced for retail sale, the E-Series still shares its engines and transmission with the Ford Super Duty trucks.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Export ===\n[[File:Ford V8 Freighter F-100.jpg|thumb|This 1955 Australian F-100 Freighter had special high side panels, perhaps unique to Australia; note the right-hand drive.]]\n\nAs of 2018, outside of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, the Ford F-150 is officially sold in most [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Caribbean|Caribbean countries]] (except Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Cuba), Suriname, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), Iceland, China, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, the Dutch territories of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Saint Maarten and the [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] of the Cayman Islands. The [[Special Vehicle Team|SVT]] Raptor is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Middle East (including Afghanistan), China, Ecuador, Chile and Peru. Both are available in LHD only.\n\nIn Mexico, the F-150 (XLT and higher trim levels) is called the \"Ford Lobo\" (Ford Wolf) while the F-150 SVT Raptor is called the \"Ford Lobo Raptor\". The F-150 XL remains as F-150 XL.\n\nThere is a strong [[Parallel import|grey market]] presence of Ford F-Series trucks around the world, most notably in Europe, China, and Australia, and usually driven by wealthy car enthusiasts, as the higher end trim models are the most sought-after versions.\n\nIn Bolivia, Ford F-series truck are imported from the United States. F-150 single, super cab and crew cab are available with short and long bed. F-series Heavy Duty like F-250, F-350 are available in Super Cab and Crew cab with long bed, but the F-450 is available only in a chassis version. The F-150 Raptor is available, too.\n\nIn Australia, Ford F-series trucks are imported and converted to right-hand drive by several Australian importers, mostly by the Harrison Motoring Group, which as become the largest importer of F-Series vehicles in the Southern Hemisphere. Harrison F-Trucks have become Australia's number one converter and supplier of the famous Ford F-Series badges.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most imported Ford F-Series trucks are the F-150 model, and usually the higher-end four door versions.\n\nRight-hand drive versions of the F-Series for the United Kingdom and Australia were manufactured in Brazil.\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the [[Gasoline|petrol]] engines are often converted to also run with alternative fuels, E-96h (Brazilian-spec ethanol) and compressed natural gas (CNG). Biodiesel also is used in Diesel engines.{{Citation needed|reason=As of the 2010s, so-called \"FlexFuel\" vehicles are commonly sold in the United States that can run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol, making them suitable for markets like Brazil.  This is no longer a distinguishing special feature, but standard with electronic fuel injection systems.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe addition of the 3.0l V6 turbo diesel engine could potentially make the Ford F-150 go global and in both LHD and RHD from the factory.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ford Super Duty]]\n*[[Ford F-series (medium duty truck)|Ford F-Series (medium duty)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Ford F-Series}}\n* [https://www.ford.com/new-trucks/ Official site]\n* [https://insideevs.com/news/361332/video-ford-f150-electric-tows-million-pounds/ Ford F-150 electric prototype tows 1.25 million pounds], video, July 2019.\n{{Ford F-Series}}{{Ford vehicles}}\n{{Early Ford trucks}}\n{{Ford trucks of the United States & Canada 1980 to present}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ford F-Series|F-Series]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1948]]\n", "name_user": "73.93.10.177", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMotorsports)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_F-Series"}

The small hamlet of [[Kirkmaiden (village)|Kirkmaiden]] itself, which contains the present-day church, is about a mile west of Drummore.\n\n==Ecclesiastical history==\nThe parish church was originally some five miles south of [[Drummore]], at a site on the Kirkburn, not far from the [[Mull of Galloway]]; the name of the nearest cove, Portankill, suggests that originally many worshippers attended Mass by boat.<ref name=\"MacQueen 2002 pp 50 & 51\"/>  The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary; and in a cave on the eastern shore of the parish at some time a hermit lived.<ref name=\"Scotland page 430\">Statistical Account of Scotland , vol 5, page 430; republished 1983</ref>  On 15 July 1393 Pope Clement VII authorised Finlay, [[Abbot of Soulseat]], to annex Kirkmaiden parish church in \u2018le Rynnis\u2019 to augment the income of the abbey.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://www.premontre.org/subpages/loci/imagines/imsoulseat/Soulseat%20Chronological%20History.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209005602/http://www.premontre.org/subpages/loci/imagines/imsoulseat/Soulseat%20Chronological%20History.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 }}, accessed 26 January 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1638 the parishioners, citing the inconvenience of the journey to church, secured the building of a new church known as Kirk Covenant on Core Hill, about a mile west of Drummore.  The patron was the Earl of Stair.\n\nFollowing the [[Disruption of 1843]], a new church was again built, for worshippers in the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], and this time in the village itself, in the street now known as Stair Street. Early in the 20th century the two congregations were reunited.  Now worship is habitually at the church within Drummore, with one service each month in the summer being held at Kirk Covenant.\n\n==Iron Age and early middle ages==\nA substantial earthwork, measuring 400&nbsp;m long, cuts off an area of about 57&nbsp;ha at the eastern end of the [[Mull of Galloway]].   In most places it comprises three ditches with medial banks, the inner bank being the larger, measuring between 3.1&nbsp;m and 4&nbsp;m in thickness with an external height of up to 2.2&nbsp;m.

The defences along the inner crests of the natural gullies on the north-east and south-east consisted of a wall originally 8'-12' thick. The internal measurement is about 110m north-west by 100m south-east, but no structures were visible in the interior.  There are entrances on the north to north-east and south, with a possible third on the north where a natural terrace provides access to the interior immediately beyond the end of the wall.\n\nWalling is visible on the north, east and south sides and some on the east, consisting of an inner wall face and heather-covered rubble about 3.0m wide.  The wall which follows the crest of a scarp over 7m high around the north, east and south sides of the summit. The wall peters out on the north and south to south-west, and there are no visible defences on the west where the ground falls away steeply to the sea 150m below.\n\nThere are four approaches to the fort, but only one, in the north-east is faced as an entrance.  A shallow hollow descends the scarp at the north to north-east entrance, which is blocked with three large boulders. At the south entrance a natural terrace drops obliquely down the scarp into a hollow 2.5m broad with a bank up to 3m thick and 0.6m high on its outer lip.\n\n(f) '''Crammag Head''' on the western shore of the Rhins was circular dun or broch with outworks about 19.5m in diameter over all, but its wall has been reduced to little more than the basal course of the outer face around the west.  The granite facing-stones measure up to 1m in length by 0.65m in breadth and 0.65m in height, and a maximum of three courses is visible on the north-west.\n\nThe interior on the west, which is now occupied by Crammag Head Light, has been raised up to 1.8m above the outer face with material from a ditch immediately east of the dun.\n\nThe ditch is broken by a causeway 2.5m wide which is faced with granite boulders along its south-side. To the north of the causeway the ditch measures 9m in breadth and varies from 1.3m in depth externally to 2m internally, but to the south it is only 6.5m in breadth and 1.1m in depth. The ditch is only visible at the southern end of the rampart and measures up to 5.5m in breadth by 0.3m in depth. The entrance through the outer defence was probably at its southern end where the rampart and ditch stop 3m and 5m short of the edge of the '''promontory''' respectively.\n\nAbout 20m east of the ditch there is an outer rampart with external ditch.  At its north end the rampart has been reduced to little more than a scatter of stones but towards the south it is up to 4.4m thick and 0.5m high. \"Vitrified\" stone was recovered from the outer rampart.\n\nIt had an entrance passage on the east where the wall was at least 4.5m to 6m thick.\n\n'''Core Hill Fort''' Iron-Dark age Fort is situated on the summit of Core Hill, immediately south of Kirkmaiden churchyard. It measures 28.3m by 21m within the inner rampart, which varies from a low bank 3.4m thick and 0.5m high, to a scarp up to 2.3m high externally. A stone axe was found in the interior.\n\n'''High [[Drummore]] Motte and Bailey''' in the mid-eastern side of the Rhins.  The mound is 10&nbsp;ft high, but is 23&nbsp;ft high to the east and protected on the west by a rampart and ditch. The top is about 40&nbsp;ft in diameter, and has a hollow about 18&nbsp;ft across and 3 to 4&nbsp;ft deep, with an entrance from the east. A rampart goes down the slope towards the east with an interspace of 60&nbsp;ft. On the south there was an entrance about 8&nbsp;ft wide at the base of the mound and on the south of the base the rampart is about 24&nbsp;ft thick at base and 6&nbsp;ft high externally. Between it and the edge of the glen lies a terrace 20&nbsp;ft wide near the mound, decreasing to the east where it is 6&nbsp;ft wide.  The bailey lies on the east and measures 28m by 20m within a bank up to 7.2m thick and 2.5m high on the south which enclosed the motte.\n\n'''5th - 6th century grave''' covered by a stone slab bearing a badly weathered Latin inscription. The original description of the stone (which is now lost) records that the name Ventidius was legible together with another, which translated as \"sub-deacon\". It is thought that this could be the 5th stone from Kirkmadrine. The grave being of a much later date. A standing stone is situated 460m NNW of Low Curghie.\n\n'''[[Cairngaan]]''', on the southern tip of the Rhins, possibly Bronze-Age.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/proceedingssoci15unkngoog#page/n248/mode/2up</ref>\n\n==Kirkmaiden in the Machars==\nA ruined church south of [[Port William, Dumfries and Galloway|Port William]] in the Machars, near Monreith in the parish of [[Glasserton]], is called \"Kirkmaiden-in-Fernis\".

The small hamlet of [[Kirkmaiden (village)|Kirkmaiden]] itself, which contains the present-day church, is about a mile west of Drummore.\n\n==Ecclesiastical history==\nThe parish church was originally some five miles south of [[Drummore]], at a site on the Kirkburn, not far from the [[Mull of Galloway]]; the name of the nearest cove, Portankill, suggests that originally many worshippers attended Mass by boat.<ref name=\"MacQueen 2002 pp 50 & 51\"/>  The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary; and in a cave on the eastern shore of the parish at some time a hermit lived.<ref name=\"Scotland page 430\">Statistical Account of Scotland , vol 5, page 430; republished 1983</ref>  On 15 July 1393 Pope Clement VII authorised Finlay, [[Abbot of Soulseat]], to annex Kirkmaiden parish church in \u2018le Rynnis\u2019 to augment the income of the abbey.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://www.premontre.org/subpages/loci/imagines/imsoulseat/Soulseat%20Chronological%20History.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209005602/http://www.premontre.org/subpages/loci/imagines/imsoulseat/Soulseat%20Chronological%20History.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 }}, accessed 26 January 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1638 the parishioners, citing the inconvenience of the journey to church, secured the building of a new church known as Kirk Covenant on Core Hill, about a mile west of Drummore.  The patron was the Earl of Stair.\n\nFollowing the [[Disruption of 1843]], a new church was again built, for worshippers in the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], and this time in the village itself, in the street now known as Stair Street. Early in the 20th century the two congregations were reunited.  Now worship is habitually at the church within Drummore, with one service each month in the summer being held at Kirk Covenant.\n\n==Iron Age and early middle ages==\nA substantial earthwork, measuring 400&nbsp;m long, cuts off an area of about 57&nbsp;ha at the eastern end of the [[Mull of Galloway]].   In most places it comprises three ditches with medial banks, the inner bank being the larger, measuring between 3.1&nbsp;m and 4&nbsp;m in thickness with an external height of up to 2.2&nbsp;m.

The defences along the inner crests of the natural gullies on the north-east and south-east consisted of a wall originally 8'-12' thick. The internal measurement is about 110m north-west by 100m south-east, but no structures were visible in the interior.  There are entrances on the north to north-east and south, with a possible third on the north where a natural terrace provides access to the interior immediately beyond the end of the wall.\n\nWalling is visible on the north, east and south sides and some on the east, consisting of an inner wall face and heather-covered rubble about 3.0m wide.  The wall which follows the crest of a scarp over 7m high around the north, east and south sides of the summit. The wall peters out on the north and south to south-west, and there are no visible defences on the west where the ground falls away steeply to the sea 150m below.\n\nThere are four approaches to the fort, but only one, in the north-east is faced as an entrance.  A shallow hollow descends the scarp at the north to north-east entrance, which is blocked with three large boulders. At the south entrance a natural terrace drops obliquely down the scarp into a hollow 2.5m broad with a bank up to 3m thick and 0.6m high on its outer lip.\n\n(f) '''Crammag Head''' on the western shore of the Rhins was circular dun or broch with outworks about 19.5m in diameter over all, but its wall has been reduced to little more than the basal course of the outer face around the west.  The granite facing-stones measure up to 1m in length by 0.65m in breadth and 0.65m in height, and a maximum of three courses is visible on the north-west.\n\nThe interior on the west, which is now occupied by Crammag Head Light, has been raised up to 1.8m above the outer face with material from a ditch immediately east of the dun.\n\nThe ditch is broken by a causeway 2.5m wide which is faced with granite boulders along its south-side. To the north of the causeway the ditch measures 9m in breadth and varies from 1.3m in depth externally to 2m internally, but to the south it is only 6.5m in breadth and 1.1m in depth. The ditch is only visible at the southern end of the rampart and measures up to 5.5m in breadth by 0.3m in depth. The entrance through the outer defence was probably at its southern end where the rampart and ditch stop 3m and 5m short of the edge of the '''promontory''' respectively.\n\nAbout 20m east of the ditch there is an outer rampart with external ditch.  At its north end the rampart has been reduced to little more than a scatter of stones but towards the south it is up to 4.4m thick and 0.5m high. \"Vitrified\" stone was recovered from the outer rampart.\n\nIt had an entrance passage on the east where the wall was at least 4.5m to 6m thick.\n\n'''Core Hill Fort''' Iron-Dark age Fort is situated on the summit of Core Hill, immediately south of Kirkmaiden churchyard. It measures 28.3m by 21m within the inner rampart, which varies from a low bank 3.4m thick and 0.5m high, to a scarp up to 2.3m high externally. A stone axe was found in the interior.\n\n'''High [[Drummore]] Motte and Bailey''' in the mid-eastern side of the Rhins.  The mound is 10&nbsp;ft high, but is 23&nbsp;ft high to the east and protected on the west by a rampart and ditch. The top is about 40&nbsp;ft in diameter, and has a hollow about 18&nbsp;ft across and 3 to 4&nbsp;ft deep, with an entrance from the east. A rampart goes down the slope towards the east with an interspace of 60&nbsp;ft. On the south there was an entrance about 8&nbsp;ft wide at the base of the mound and on the south of the base the rampart is about 24&nbsp;ft thick at base and 6&nbsp;ft high externally. Between it and the edge of the glen lies a terrace 20&nbsp;ft wide near the mound, decreasing to the east where it is 6&nbsp;ft wide.  The bailey lies on the east and measures 28m by 20m within a bank up to 7.2m thick and 2.5m high on the south which enclosed the motte.\n\n'''5th - 6th century grave''' covered by a stone slab bearing a badly weathered Latin inscription.

The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with [[ISO/IEC 10646]], and both are code-for-code identical.\n\n''The Unicode Standard'' consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard [[character encoding]]s, a set of reference [[data file]]s, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for [[Unicode normalization|normalization]], decomposition, [[Unicode collation algorithm|collation]], rendering, and [[bidirectional text]] display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and left-to-right scripts).<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Unicode Standard: A Technical Introduction | url = https://www.unicode.org/standard/principles.html | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\nUnicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the [[internationalization and localization]] of computer [[software]]. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including modern [[operating system]]s, [[XML]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (and other programming languages), and the [[.NET Framework]].\n\n[[Comparison of Unicode encodings|Unicode can be implemented]] by different [[character encoding]]s. The Unicode standard defines [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]], and [[UTF-32]], and several other encodings are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and [[Universal Coded Character Set|UCS]]-2 (without full support for Unicode), a precursor of UTF-16; [[GB 18030|GB18030]] is standardized in China and implements Unicode fully, while not an official Unicode standard.\n\nUTF-8, the dominant encoding on the [[World Wide Web]] (used in over 94% of websites {{As of|2019|November|df=|lc=y}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/character_encoding/ranking|title=Usage Survey of Character Encodings broken down by Ranking|website=w3techs.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> uses one [[byte]] for the first 128 [[code point]]s, and up to 4 bytes for other characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#I1.36559|work=The Unicode Standard|title=Conformance | date=March 2020|accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref> The first 128 Unicode code points represent the [[ASCII]] characters, which means that any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text.\n\nUCS-2 uses two bytes (16&nbsp;bits) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points, the so-called [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP).  With 1,112,064 possible Unicode code points corresponding to characters (see [[#Architecture and terminology|below]]) on 17 planes, and with over 143,000 code points defined as of version 13.0, UCS-2 is only able to represent less than half of all encoded Unicode characters.  Therefore, UCS-2 is outdated, though still widely used in software.  UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same [[16-bit]] encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is valid UTF-16 text.\n\nUTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character. Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all Unicode code points. However, because each character uses four bytes, UTF-32 takes significantly more space than other encodings, and is not widely used.\n\n==Origin and development==\nUnicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing (usually using [[Latin character]]s and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other).\n\nUnicode, in intent, encodes the underlying characters\u2014[[grapheme]]s and grapheme-like units\u2014rather than the variant [[glyph]]s (renderings) for such characters. In the case of [[Chinese characters]], this sometimes leads to controversies over distinguishing the underlying character from its variant glyphs (see [[Han unification]]).\n\nIn text processing, Unicode takes the role of providing a unique ''code point''\u2014a [[number]], not a glyph\u2014for each character. In other words, Unicode represents a character in an abstract way and leaves the visual rendering (size, shape, [[font]], or style) to other software, such as a [[web browser]] or [[word processor]]. This simple aim becomes complicated, however, because of concessions made by Unicode's designers in the hope of encouraging a more rapid adoption of Unicode.\n\nThe first 256 code points were made identical to the content of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] so as to make it trivial to convert existing western text. Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve distinctions used by legacy encodings and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to Unicode (and back) without losing any information. For example, the \"[[Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (Unicode block)|fullwidth forms]]\" section of code points encompasses a full duplicate of the Latin alphabet because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ([[CJK]]) fonts contain two versions of these letters, \"fullwidth\" matching the width of the CJK characters, and normal width. For other examples, see [[duplicate characters in Unicode]].\n\n==={{anchor|Unicode 88}}History===\nBased on experiences with the [[Xerox Character Code Standard]] (XCCS) since 1980,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> the origins of Unicode date to 1987, when [[Joe Becker (Unicode)|Joe Becker]] from [[Xerox]] with [[Lee Collins (software engineer)|Lee Collins]] and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], started investigating the practicalities of creating a universal character set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Summary Narrative |url=https://www.unicode.org/history/summary.html |access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref> With additional input from Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> Joe Becker published a draft proposal for an \"international/multilingual text character encoding system in August 1988, tentatively called Unicode\". He explained that \"[t]he name 'Unicode' is intended to suggest a unique, unified, universal encoding\".<ref name=\"unicode-88\">{{Cite web |url=https://unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf |title=Unicode 88 |author-last=Becker |author-first=Joseph D. |author-link=Joseph D.

Many persons contributed ideas to the development of a new encoding design. Beginning in 1980, these efforts evolved into the [[Xerox Character Code Standard]] (XCCS) by the present author, a multilingual encoding which has been maintained by Xerox as an internal corporate standard since 1982, through the efforts of Ed Smura, Ron Pellar, and others.<br/>Unicode arose as the result of eight years of working experience with XCCS. Its fundamental differences from XCCS were proposed by Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad (pure 16-bit codes), and by [[Lee Collins (Unicode)|Lee Collins]] (ideographic character unification). Unicode retains the many features of XCCS whose utility have been proved over the years in an international line of communication multilingual system products.}}</ref>\n\nIn this document, entitled ''Unicode 88'', Becker outlined a [[16-bit]] character model:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode is intended to address the need for a workable, reliable world text encoding. Unicode could be roughly described as \"wide-body ASCII\" that has been stretched to 16&nbsp;bits to encompass the characters of all the world's living languages. In a properly engineered design, 16&nbsp;bits per character are more than sufficient for this purpose.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis original 16-bit design was based on the assumption that only those scripts and characters in modern use would need to be encoded:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode gives higher priority to ensuring utility for the future than to preserving past antiquities. Unicode aims in the first instance at the characters published in modern text (e.g. in the union of all newspapers and magazines printed in the world in 1988), whose number is undoubtedly far below 2<sup>14</sup> = 16,384. Beyond those modern-use characters, all others may be defined to be obsolete or rare; these are better candidates for private-use registration than for congesting the public list of generally useful Unicodes.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn early 1989, the Unicode working group expanded to include Ken Whistler and Mike Kernaghan of Metaphor, Karen Smith-Yoshimura and Joan Aliprand of [[Research Libraries Group|RLG]], and Glenn Wright of [[Sun Microsystems]], and in 1990, Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag from [[Microsoft]] and Rick McGowan of [[NeXT]] joined the group. By the end of 1990, most of the work on mapping existing character encoding standards had been completed, and a final review draft of Unicode was ready.\n\nThe [[Unicode Consortium]] was incorporated in California on 3 January 1991,<ref>[https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html History of Unicode Release and Publication Dates] on ''unicode.org.'' Retrieved February 28, 2017.</ref> and in October 1991, the first volume of the Unicode standard was published. The second volume, covering Han ideographs, was published in June 1992.\n\nIn 1996, a surrogate character mechanism was implemented in Unicode 2.0, so that Unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits. This increased the Unicode codespace to over a million code points, which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts (e.g., [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding. Among the characters not originally intended for Unicode are rarely used Kanji or Chinese characters, many of which are part of personal and place names, making them rarely used, but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of Unicode.<ref name=unicoderevisited>{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Stephen J|title=Unicode Revisited|url=http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/unicoderevisited.html|accessdate=2013-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Microsoft TrueType specification version 1.0 from 1992 used the name ''Apple Unicode'' instead of ''Unicode'' for the Platform ID in the naming table.\n\n===Unicode Consortium===\n{{Main|Unicode Consortium}}\n\nThe Unicode Consortium is a nonprofit organization that coordinates Unicode's development.

Further additions of characters to the already encoded scripts, as well as symbols, in particular for mathematics and [[musical notation|music]] (in the form of notes and rhythmic symbols), also occur.\n\nThe Unicode Roadmap Committee ([[Michael Everson]], Rick McGowan, Ken Whistler, V.S.

For some scripts on the Roadmap, such as [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]] and [[Khitan small script]], encoding proposals have been made and they are working their way through the approval process. For others scripts, such as [[Maya script|Mayan]] (besides numbers) and [[Rongorongo]], no proposal has yet been made, and they await agreement on character repertoire and other details from the user communities involved.\n\nSome modern invented scripts which have not yet been included in Unicode (e.g., [[Tengwar]]) or which do not qualify for inclusion in Unicode due to lack of real-world use (e.g., [[Klingon scripts|Klingon]]) are listed in the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]], along with unofficial but widely used [[Private Use Areas]] code assignments.\n\nThere is also a [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative]] focused on special Latin medieval characters. Part of these proposals have been already included into Unicode.\n\nThe [https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/ Script Encoding Initiative], a project run by Deborah Anderson at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] was founded in 2002 with the goal of funding proposals for scripts not yet encoded in the standard. The project has become a major source of proposed additions to the standard in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/pending/about-sei.html |title=About The Script Encoding Initiative |publisher=The Unicode Consortium |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|1.0.0|1.0.1|1.1|2.0|2.1|3.0|3.1|3.2|4.0|4.1|5.0|5.1|5.2|6.0|6.1|6.2|6.3|7.0|8.0|9.0|10.0|11.0|12.0|12.1|13.0}}Versions===\nUnicode is developed in conjunction with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and shares the character repertoire with [[ISO/IEC 10646]]: the Universal Character Set.

Out of these 2<sup>16</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> defined code points, the code points from U+D800 through U+DFFF, which are used to encode surrogate pairs in [[UTF-16]], are reserved by the Standard and may not be used to encode valid characters, resulting in a net total of 2<sup>16</sup> &minus; 2<sup>11</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> = 1,112,064 possible code points corresponding to valid Unicode characters.  Not all of these code points necessarily correspond to visible characters; several, for example, are assigned to control codes such as [[carriage return]].\n\n===Code point planes and blocks===\n{{Main|Plane (Unicode)}}\nThe Unicode codespace is divided into seventeen ''planes'', numbered 0 to 16:\n\n{{Planes (Unicode)}}\n\nAll code points in the BMP are accessed as a single code unit in [[UTF-16]] encoding and can be encoded in one, two or three bytes in [[UTF-8]]. Code points in Planes 1 through 16 (''supplementary planes'') are accessed as surrogate pairs in UTF-16 and encoded in four bytes in UTF-8.\n\nWithin each plane, characters are allocated within named ''[[Block (Unicode)|blocks]]'' of related characters. Although blocks are an arbitrary size, they are always a multiple of 16 code points and often a multiple of 128 code points. Characters required for a given script may be spread out over several different blocks.\n\n===General Category property===\nEach code point has a single [[Character property (Unicode)#General Category|General Category]] property. The major categories are denoted: Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol, Separator and Other. Within these categories, there are subdivisions. In most cases other properties must be used to sufficiently specify the characteristics of a code point. The possible General Categories are:\n\n{{General Category (Unicode)}}\n\nCode points in the range U+D800\u2013U+DBFF (1,024 code points) are known as high-'''surrogate''' code points, and code points in the range U+DC00\u2013U+DFFF (1,024 code points) are known as low-surrogate code points. A high-surrogate code point followed by a low-surrogate code point form a surrogate pair in [[UTF-16]] to represent code points greater than U+FFFF. These code points otherwise cannot be used (this rule is ignored often in practice especially when not using UTF-16).\n\nA small set of code points are guaranteed never to be used for encoding characters, although applications may make use of these code points internally if they wish. There are sixty-six of these '''noncharacters''': U+FDD0\u2013U+FDEF and any code point ending in the value FFFE or FFFF (i.e., U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, \u2026 U+10FFFE, U+10FFFF). The set of noncharacters is stable, and no new noncharacters will ever be defined.<ref name=\"stability-policy\">{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy\n| url = https://unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> Like surrogates, the rule that these cannot be used is often ignored, although the operation of the [[byte order mark]] assumes that U+FFFE will never be the first code point in a text.\n\nExcluding surrogates and noncharacters leaves 1,111,998 code points available for use.\n\n'''Private-use''' code points are considered to be assigned characters, but they have no interpretation specified by the Unicode standard<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Properties\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#G43463\n| accessdate = 2020-03-15 }}\n</ref> so any interchange of such characters requires an agreement between sender and receiver on their interpretation. There are three private-use areas in the Unicode codespace:\n\n* Private Use Area: U+E000\u2013U+F8FF (6,400 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-A: U+F0000\u2013U+FFFFD (65,534 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-B: U+100000\u2013U+10FFFD (65,534 characters).\n\nGraphic characters are characters defined by Unicode to have particular semantics, and either have a visible [[glyph]] shape or represent a visible space. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 143,696 graphic characters.\n\n'''Format''' characters are characters that do not have a visible appearance, but may have an effect on the appearance or behavior of neighboring characters. For example, {{unichar|200C|Zero-width non-joiner|nlink=}} and {{unichar|200D|Zero-width joiner|nlink=}} may be used to change the default shaping behavior of adjacent characters (e.g., to inhibit ligatures or request ligature formation). There are 163 format characters in Unicode 13.0.\n\nSixty-five code points (U+0000\u2013U+001F and U+007F\u2013U+009F) are reserved as '''control''' codes, and correspond to the [[C0 and C1 control codes]] defined in [[ISO/IEC 6429]]. U+0009 (Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), and U+000D (Carriage Return) are widely used in Unicode-encoded texts. In practice the C1 code points are often improperly-translated ([[Mojibake]]) legacy [[Windows-1252]] characters used by some English and Western European texts with Windows technologies.\n\nGraphic characters, format characters, control code characters, and private use characters are known collectively as ''assigned characters''. '''Reserved''' code points are those code points which are available for use, but are not yet assigned. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 830,606 reserved code points.\n\n===Abstract characters===\nThe set of graphic and format characters defined by Unicode does not correspond directly to the repertoire of ''abstract characters'' that is representable under Unicode. Unicode encodes characters by associating an abstract character with a particular code point.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Model\n| url = https://unicode.org/reports/tr17/\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> However, not all abstract characters are encoded as a single Unicode character, and some abstract characters may be represented in Unicode by a sequence of two or more characters. For example, a Latin small letter \"i\" with an [[ogonek]], a [[dot above]], and an [[acute accent]], which is required in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], is represented by the character sequence U+012F, U+0307, U+0301. Unicode maintains a list of uniquely named character sequences for abstract characters that are not directly encoded in Unicode.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Named Sequences\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamedSequences.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref>\n\nAll graphic, format, and private use characters have a unique and immutable name by which they may be identified. This immutability has been guaranteed since Unicode version 2.0 by the Name Stability policy.<ref name=\"stability-policy\" /> In cases where the name is seriously defective and misleading, or has a serious typographical error, a formal alias may be defined, and applications are encouraged to use the formal alias in place of the official character name. For example, {{unichar|A015|YI SYLLABLE WU}} has the formal alias {{sc2|YI SYLLABLE ITERATION MARK}}, and {{unichar|FE18|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''KC'''ET|note=[[sic]]}} has the formal alias {{sc2|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''CK'''ET}}.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Name Aliases\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\n===Ready-made versus composite characters===\nUnicode includes a mechanism for modifying characters that greatly extends the supported glyph repertoire. This covers the use of [[combining diacritical mark]]s that may be added after the base character by the user. Multiple combining diacritics may be simultaneously applied to the same character. Unicode also contains [[precomposed character|precomposed]] versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters. For example, ''\u00e9'' can be represented in Unicode as [[#Upluslink|U+]]0065 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E}}) followed by U+0301 ({{sc2|COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}}), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE}}). Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character. To deal with this, Unicode provides the mechanism of [[canonical equivalence]].\n\nAn example of this arises with [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet. Unicode provides a mechanism for composing Hangul syllables with their individual subcomponents, known as [[Hangul Jamo]]. However, it also provides 11,172 combinations of precomposed syllables made from the most common jamo.\n\nThe [[CJK]] characters currently have codes only for their precomposed form. Still, most of those characters comprise simpler elements (called [[Radical_(Chinese_characters)|radicals]]), so in principle Unicode could have decomposed them as it did with Hangul. This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points, while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable character (which might do away with some of the problems caused by [[Han unification]]). A similar idea is used by some [[input method]]s, such as [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] and [[Wubi method|Wubi]]. However, attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that Chinese characters do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does.\n\nA set of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] was provided in Unicode 3.0 (CJK radicals between U+2E80 and U+2EFF, KangXi radicals in U+2F00 to U+2FDF, and ideographic description characters from U+2FF0 to U+2FFB), but the Unicode standard (ch. 12.2 of Unicode 5.2) warns against using [[Ideographic Description Sequences|ideographic description sequences]] as an alternate representation for previously encoded characters:\n\n{{quote|This process is different from a formal ''encoding'' of an ideograph. There is no canonical description of unencoded ideographs; there is no semantic assigned to described ideographs; there is no equivalence defined for described ideographs. Conceptually, ideographic descriptions are more akin to the English phrase \"an 'e' with an acute accent on it\" than to the character sequence &lt;U+0065, U+0301&gt;.}}\n\n===Ligatures===\nMany scripts, including [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Devanagari|Devan\u0101gar\u012b]], have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special [[ligature (typography)|ligature forms]]. The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE (Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard), which became the [[proof of concept]] for [[OpenType]] (by Adobe and Microsoft), [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] (by [[SIL International]]), or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] (by Apple).\n\nInstructions are also embedded in fonts to tell the [[operating system]] how to properly output different character sequences. A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with). A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs. Real stacking is impossible, but can be approximated in limited cases (for example, Thai top-combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with). Generally this approach is only effective in monospaced fonts, but may be used as a fallback rendering method when more complex methods fail.\n\n===Standardized subsets===\nSeveral subsets of Unicode are standardized: Microsoft Windows since [[Windows NT 4.0]] supports [[WGL-4]] with 656 characters, which is considered to support all contemporary European languages using the Latin, Greek, or Cyrillic script.

Some systems have made attempts to provide more information about such characters. Apple's [[Last Resort font]] will display a substitute glyph indicating the Unicode range of the character, and the [[SIL International]]'s [[Unicode fallback font|Unicode Fallback]] font will display a box showing the hexadecimal scalar value of the character.\n\n==={{anchor|UTF|UCS}}Mapping and encodings===\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been specified for storing a series of code points as a series of bytes.\n\n<!-- [[Unicode Transformation Format]] redirects here -->\nUnicode defines two mapping methods: the ''Unicode Transformation Format'' (UTF) encodings, and the ''[[Universal Coded Character Set]]'' (UCS) encodings. An encoding maps (possibly a subset of) the range of Unicode ''code points'' to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed ''code units''. All UTF encodings map code points to a unique sequence of bytes.<ref>{{cite web|title=UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM|url=https://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html|website=Unicode.org FAQ|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits per code unit (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per code unit (for UCS encodings and UTF-1). UTF-8 and UTF-16 are the most commonly used encodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent.\n\nUTF encodings include:\n\n* [[UTF-1]], a retired predecessor of UTF-8, maximizes compatibility with [[ISO/IEC 2022|ISO 2022]], no longer part of ''The Unicode Standard''\n* [[UTF-7]], a 7-bit encoding sometimes used in e-mail, often considered obsolete (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'', but only documented as an informational [[Request for Comments|RFC]], i.e., not on the Internet Standards Track)\n* [[UTF-8]], uses one to four bytes for each code point, maximizes compatibility with [[ASCII]]\n* [[UTF-EBCDIC]], similar to UTF-8 but designed for compatibility with [[EBCDIC]] (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'')\n* [[UTF-16]], uses one or two 16-bit code units per code point, cannot encode surrogates\n* [[UTF-32]], uses one 32-bit code unit per code point\n\nUTF-8 uses one to four bytes per code point and, being compact for Latin scripts and ASCII-compatible, provides the ''de facto'' standard encoding for interchange of Unicode text. It is used by [[FreeBSD]] and most recent [[Linux distributions]] as a direct replacement for legacy encodings in general text handling.\n\nThe UCS-2 and UTF-16 encodings specify the Unicode [[Byte Order Mark]] (BOM) for use at the beginnings of text files, which may be used for byte ordering detection (or [[endianness|byte endianness]] detection). The BOM, code point U+FEFF has the important property of unambiguity on byte reorder, regardless of the Unicode encoding used; U+FFFE (the result of byte-swapping U+FEFF) does not equate to a legal character, and U+FEFF in other places, other than the beginning of text, conveys the zero-width non-break space (a character with no appearance and no effect other than preventing the formation of [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]]).\n\nThe same character converted to UTF-8 becomes the byte sequence <code>EF BB BF</code>. The Unicode Standard allows that the BOM \"can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked\".<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.2 | publisher=The Unicode Consortium | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-936213-08-5 | page=561 }}</ref> Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings, including UTF-8, in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit [[code page]]s. However {{IETF RFC|3629}}, the UTF-8 standard, recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8, but discusses the cases where this may not be possible. In addition, the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 (for instance there cannot be any lone bytes with the high bit set) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM.\n\nIn UTF-32 and UCS-4, one [[32-bit]] code unit serves as a fairly direct representation of any character's code point (although the endianness, which varies across different platforms, affects how the code unit manifests as a byte sequence). In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code units. UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] compilers to generate software uses it as the standard \"[[wide character]]\" encoding. Some programming languages, such as [[Seed7]], use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters. Recent versions of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language (beginning with 2.2) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings, effectively disseminating such encoding in [[high-level programming language|high-level]] coded software.\n\n[[Punycode]], another encoding form, enables the encoding of Unicode strings into the limited character set supported by the [[ASCII]]-based [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). The encoding is used as part of [[IDNA]], which is a system enabling the use of [[Internationalized Domain Names]] in all scripts that are supported by Unicode. Earlier and now historical proposals include [[UTF-5]] and [[UTF-6]].\n\n[[GB 18030|GB18030]] is another encoding form for Unicode, from the [[Standardization Administration of China]]. It is the official [[character set]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU-1]] and [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]] are Unicode compression schemes. The [[April Fools' Day RFC]] of 2005 specified two [[parody]] UTF encodings, [[UTF-9]] and [[UTF-18]].\n\n==Adoption==\n\n===Operating systems===\nUnicode has become the dominant scheme for internal processing and storage of text. Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems. Early adopters tended to use [[UCS-2]] (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to UTF-16) and later moved to [[UTF-16]] (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is [[Windows NT]] (and its descendants, [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]]), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The [[Java virtual machine|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] bytecode environments, [[macOS]], and [[KDE]] also use it for internal representation. Partial support for Unicode can be installed on [[Windows 9x]] through the [[Microsoft Layer for Unicode]].\n\n[[UTF-8]] (originally developed for [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]])<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt\n | title = UTF-8 history\n | first = Rob | last = Pike | authorlink = Rob Pike\n | date = 2003-04-30\n}}</ref> has become the main storage encoding on most [[Unix-like]] operating systems (though others are also used by some libraries) because it is a relatively easy replacement for traditional [[extended ASCII]] character sets. UTF-8 is also the most common Unicode encoding used in [[HTML]] documents on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\nMultilingual text-rendering engines which use Unicode include [[Uniscribe]] and [[DirectWrite]] for Microsoft Windows, [[ATSUI]] and [[Core Text]] for macOS, and [[Pango]] for [[GTK+]] and the [[GNOME]] desktop.\n\n===Input methods===\n{{Main|Unicode input}}\n\nBecause keyboard layouts cannot have simple key combinations for all characters, several operating systems provide alternative input methods that allow access to the entire repertoire.\n\n[[ISO/IEC 14755]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/ISO-14755.pdf |title=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 18/WG 9 N |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> which standardises methods for entering Unicode characters from their code points, specifies several methods. There is the ''Basic method'', where a ''beginning sequence'' is followed by the hexadecimal representation of the code point and the ''ending sequence''. There is also a ''screen-selection entry method'' specified, where the characters are listed in a table in a screen, such as with a character map program.\n\nOnline tools for finding the code point for a known character include Unicode Lookup<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unicodelookup.com/|title=Unicode Lookup|last=Hedley|first=Jonathan|date=2009}}</ref> by Jonathan Hedley and Shapecatcher<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shapecatcher.com/|title=Unicode Character Recognition|last=Milde|first=Benjamin|date=2011}}</ref> by Benjamin Milde. In Unicode Lookup, one enters a search key (e.g. \"fractions\"), and a list of corresponding characters with their code points is returned. In Shapecatcher, based on [[Shape context]], one draws the character in a box and a list of characters approximating the drawing, with their code points, is returned.\n\n===Email===\n{{Main|Unicode and email}}\n\n[[MIME]] defines two different mechanisms for encoding non-ASCII characters in [[email]], depending on whether the characters are in email headers (such as the \"Subject:\"), or in the text body of the message; in both cases, the original character set is identified as well as a transfer encoding. For email transmission of Unicode, the [[UTF-8]] character set and the [[Base64]] or the [[Quoted-printable]] transfer encoding are recommended, depending on whether much of the message consists of [[ASCII]] characters. The details of the two different mechanisms are specified in the MIME standards and generally are hidden from users of email software.\n\nThe adoption of Unicode in email has been very slow. Some East Asian text is still encoded in encodings such as [[ISO-2022]], and some devices, such as mobile phones, still cannot correctly handle Unicode data. Support has been improving, however. Many major free mail providers such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] ([[Gmail]]), and [[Microsoft]] ([[Outlook.com]]) support it.\n\n===Web===\n{{Main|Unicode and HTML}}\n\nAll [[W3C]] recommendations have used Unicode as their ''document character set'' since HTML 4.0. [[Web browser]]s have supported Unicode, especially UTF-8, for many years. There used to be display problems resulting primarily from [[typeface|font]] related issues; e.g. v 6 and older of Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]] did not render many code points unless explicitly told to use a font that contains them.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan |last=Wood |url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/explorer.html#ie5 |title=Setting up Windows Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6 for Multilingual and Unicode Support |publisher=Alan Wood |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough syntax rules may affect the order in which characters are allowed to appear, [[XML]] (including [[XHTML]]) documents, by definition,<ref>{{cite web|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 (Second Edition)|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11|accessdate=2013-11-01}}</ref> comprise characters from most of the Unicode code points, with the exception of:\n\n* most of the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0 control codes]]\n* the permanently unassigned code points D800\u2013DFFF\n* FFFE or FFFF\n\nHTML characters manifest either directly as [[byte]]s according to document's encoding, if the encoding supports them, or users may write them as numeric character references based on the character's Unicode code point. For example, the references <code>&amp;#916;</code>, <code>&amp;#1049;</code>, <code>&amp;#1511;</code>, <code>&amp;#1605;</code>, <code>&amp;#3671;</code>, <code>&amp;#12354;</code>, <code>&amp;#21494;</code>, <code>&amp;#33865;</code>, and <code>&amp;#47568;</code> (or the same numeric values expressed in hexadecimal, with <code>&amp;#x</code> as the prefix) should display on all browsers as \u0394, \u0419, \u05e7 ,\u0645, \u0e57, \u3042, \u53f6, \u8449, and \ub9d0.\n\nWhen specifying [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]], for example as [[URL]]s in [[HTTP]] requests, non-ASCII characters must be [[percent encoding|percent-encoded]].\n\n===Fonts===\n{{Main|Unicode font}}\n\nUnicode is not in principle concerned with fonts ''per se'', seeing them as implementation choices.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/wiley/journals/epobetan/pdf/volume6/issue3/bigelow.pdf  | title = The design of a Unicode font | journal = Electronic Publishing | volume = VOL. 6(3), 289\u2013305 | date = September 1993 | page = 292 |last1 = Bigelow | first1=Charles | last2 = Holmes | first2 = Kris}}</ref> Any given character may have many [[allograph]]s, from the more common bold, italic and base letterforms to complex decorative styles.

These font formats map Unicode code points to glyphs, but TrueType font is restricted to 65,535 glyphs.\n\n[[List of typefaces|Thousands of fonts]] exist on the market, but fewer than a dozen fonts\u2014sometimes described as \"pan-Unicode\" fonts\u2014attempt to support the majority of Unicode's character repertoire. Instead, Unicode-based [[List of Unicode fonts|fonts]] typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols. Several reasons justify this approach: applications and documents rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed, i.e., [[font substitution]]. Furthermore, designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task; such a venture passes the point of [[diminishing returns]] for most typefaces.\n\n===Newlines===\nUnicode partially addresses the [[newline]] problem that occurs when trying to read a text file on different platforms. Unicode defines a large number of [[Newline#Unicode|characters]] that conforming applications should recognize as line terminators.\n\nIn terms of the newline, Unicode introduced {{unichar|2028|LINE SEPARATOR}} and {{unichar|2029|PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR}}. This was an attempt to provide a Unicode solution to encoding paragraphs and lines semantically, potentially replacing all of the various platform solutions. In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions. Nonetheless, few if any Unicode solutions have adopted these Unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters. However, a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization. This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML and HTML recommendations. In this approach every possible newline character is converted internally to a common newline (which one does not really matter since it is an internal operation just for rendering). In other words, the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual encoding.\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Philosophical and completeness criticisms===\n[[Han unification]] (the identification of forms in the [[East Asian language]]s which one can treat as stylistic variations of the same historical character) has become one of the most controversial aspects of Unicode, despite the presence of a majority of experts from all three regions in the [[Ideographic Research Group]] (IRG), which advises the Consortium and ISO on additions to the repertoire and on Han unification.<ref>[http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html A Brief History of Character Codes], Steven J. Searle, originally written [https://web.archive.org/web/20001216022100/http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html 1999], last updated 2004</ref>\n\nUnicode has been criticized for failing to separately encode older and alternative forms of [[kanji]] which, critics argue, complicates the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names. This is often due to the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than glyphs (the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another). Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves, not just the basic character representation, are being merged.<ref name=\"dw2001\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130625062705/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/u-secret.html The secret life of Unicode: A peek at Unicode's soft underbelly], Suzanne Topping, 1 May 2001 ''(Internet Archive)''</ref>{{clarify|date=April 2010|reason=\"and, contains\" and meaning of statement}} There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification. An example of one is [[TRON (encoding)|TRON]] (although it is not widely adopted in Japan, there are some users who need to handle historical Japanese text and favor it).\n\nAlthough the repertoire of fewer than 21,000 Han characters in the earliest version of Unicode was largely limited to characters in common modern usage, Unicode now includes more than 92,000 Han characters, and work is continuing to add thousands more historic and dialectal characters used in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\n\nModern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations, in the form of [[variation Selectors|Unicode variation sequences]]. For example, the Advanced Typographic tables of [[OpenType]] permit one of a number of alternative glyph representations to be selected when performing the character to glyph mapping process. In this case, information can be provided within plain text to designate which alternate character form to select.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|right|Various [[Cyrillic]] characters shown with and without italics]]\nIf the difference in the appropriate glyphs for two characters in the same script differ only in the italic, Unicode has generally unified them, as can be seen in the comparison between Russian (labeled standard) and Serbian characters at right, meaning that the differences are displayed through smart font technology or manually changing fonts.\n\n===Mapping to legacy character sets===\nUnicode was designed to provide code-point-by-code-point [[round-trip format conversion]] to and from any preexisting character encodings, so that text files in older character sets can be converted to Unicode and then back and get back the same file, without employing context-dependent interpretation. That has meant that inconsistent legacy architectures, such as [[combining character|combining diacritics]] and [[precomposed character]]s, both exist in Unicode, giving more than one method of representing some text. This is most pronounced in the three different encoding forms for Korean [[Hangul]]. Since version 3.0, any precomposed characters that can be represented by a combining sequence of already existing characters can no longer be added to the standard in order to preserve interoperability between software using different versions of Unicode.\n\n[[Injective]] mappings must be provided between characters in existing legacy character sets and characters in Unicode to facilitate conversion to Unicode and allow interoperability with legacy software. Lack of consistency in various mappings between earlier Japanese encodings such as [[Shift-JIS]] or [[EUC-JP]] and Unicode led to [[round-trip format conversion]] mismatches, particularly the mapping of the character JIS X 0208 '\uff5e' (1-33, WAVE DASH), heavily used in legacy database data, to either {{unichar|FF5E|FULLWIDTH TILDE}} (in [[Microsoft Windows]]) or {{unichar|301C|WAVE DASH}} (other vendors).<ref>\n[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2166.doc AFII contribution about WAVE DASH], {{Cite web|url=http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422181018/http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|title=An Unicode vendor-specific character table for japanese|date=2011-04-22|archive-date=2011-04-22|website=web.archive.org<!--|access-date=2019-05-20-->}}</ref>\n\nSome Japanese computer programmers objected to Unicode because it requires them to separate the use of {{unichar|005C|REVERSE SOLIDUS|note=backslash}} and {{unichar|00A5|YEN SIGN}}, which was mapped to 0x5C in JIS X 0201, and a lot of legacy code exists with this usage.<ref>[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/intro-i18n/ch-codes.en.html#s-646problem ''ISO 646-* Problem''], Section 4.4.3.5 of ''Introduction to I18n'', Tomohiro KUBOTA, 2001</ref> (This encoding also replaces tilde '~' 0x7E with macron '\u00af', now 0xAF.) The separation of these characters exists in [[ISO 8859-1]], from long before Unicode.\n\n===Indic scripts===\n[[Indic script]]s such as [[Tamil script|Tamil]] and [[Devanagari]] are each allocated only 128 code points, matching the [[ISCII]] standard. The correct rendering of Unicode Indic text requires transforming the stored logical order characters into visual order and the forming of ligatures (aka conjuncts) out of components. Some local scholars argued in favor of assignments of Unicode code points to these ligatures, going against the practice for other writing systems, though Unicode contains some Arabic and other ligatures for backward compatibility purposes only.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-A\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB50.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-B\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE70.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Alphabetic Presentation Forms\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB00.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref> Encoding of any new ligatures in Unicode will not happen, in part because the set of ligatures is font-dependent, and Unicode is an encoding independent of font variations. The same kind of issue arose for the [[Tibetan script]] in 2003 when the [[Standardization Administration of China]] proposed encoding 956 precomposed Tibetan syllables,<ref>{{Cite web | author=China | title=Proposal on Tibetan BrdaRten Characters Encoding for ISO/IEC 10646 in BMP | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02455-n2558-tibetan.pdf | date=2 December 2002 }}</ref> but these were rejected for encoding by the relevant ISO committee ([[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]]).<ref>{{Cite web | author= V. S. Umamaheswaran | title=Resolutions of WG 2 meeting 44 | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03390r-n2654.pdf | at=Resolution M44.20 | date=7 November 2003 }}</ref>\n\n[[Thai alphabet]] support has been criticized for its ordering of Thai characters. The vowels \u0e40, \u0e41, \u0e42, \u0e43, \u0e44 that are written to the left of the preceding consonant are in visual order instead of phonetic order, unlike the Unicode representations of other Indic scripts. This complication is due to Unicode inheriting the [[TIS-620|Thai Industrial Standard 620]], which worked in the same way, and was the way in which Thai had always been written on keyboards. This ordering problem complicates the Unicode collation process slightly, requiring table lookups to reorder Thai characters for collation.<ref name=\"dw2001\" /> Even if Unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order, it would still be problematic to collate words in dictionary order. E.g., the word {{wiktth|\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e07}} {{IPA-th|sa d\u025b\u02d0\u014b|}} \"perform\" starts with a consonant cluster \"\u0e2a\u0e14\" (with an inherent vowel for the consonant \"\u0e2a\"), the vowel \u0e41-, in spoken order would come after the \u0e14, but in a dictionary, the word is collated as it is written, with the vowel following the \u0e2a.\n\n===Combining characters===\n{{Main|Combining character}}\n{{See also|Unicode normalization#Normalization}}\n\nCharacters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non-spacing marks. For example, \u1e17 (precomposed e with macron and acute above) and e&#772;&#769; (e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above) should be rendered identically, both appearing as an [[e]] with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] and [[acute accent]], but in practice, their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters. Similarly, [[dot (diacritic)|underdots]], as needed in the [[romanization]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], will often be placed incorrectly.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases, thus avoiding the problem, but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as [[Charis SIL]] that uses [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]], [[OpenType]], or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] technologies for advanced rendering features.\n\n===Anomalies===\n{{main|Unicode alias names and abbreviations}}\nThe Unicode standard has imposed rules intended to guarantee stability.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html Unicode stability policy]</ref> Depending on the strictness of a rule, a change can be prohibited or allowed. For example, a \"name\" given to a code point cannot and will not change. But a \"script\" property is more flexible, by Unicode's own rules. In version 2.0, Unicode changed many code point \"names\" from version 1. At the same moment, Unicode stated that from then on, an assigned name to a code point will never change anymore. This implies that when mistakes are published, these mistakes cannot be corrected, even if they are trivial (as happened in one instance with the spelling {{sc2|{{typo|BRAKCET}}}} for {{sc2|BRACKET}} in a character name). In 2006 a list of anomalies in character names was first published, and, as of April 2017, there were 94 characters with identified issues,<ref name=\"tn17\">{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/notes/tn27/ |title=Unicode Technical Note #27: Known Anomalies in Unicode Character Names |date=10 April 2017 |website=unicode.org}}</ref> for example:\n\n* {{unichar|2118|script capital p|nlink=Weierstrass p}}: This is a small letter.

The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with [[ISO/IEC 10646]], and both are code-for-code identical.\n\n''The Unicode Standard'' consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard [[character encoding]]s, a set of reference [[data file]]s, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for [[Unicode normalization|normalization]], decomposition, [[Unicode collation algorithm|collation]], rendering, and [[bidirectional text]] display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and left-to-right scripts).<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Unicode Standard: A Technical Introduction | url = https://www.unicode.org/standard/principles.html | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\nUnicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread and predominant use in the [[internationalization and localization]] of computer [[software]]. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including modern [[operating system]]s, [[XML]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (and other programming languages), and the [[.NET Framework]].\n\n[[Comparison of Unicode encodings|Unicode can be implemented]] by different [[character encoding]]s. The Unicode standard defines [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]], and [[UTF-32]], and several other encodings are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and [[Universal Coded Character Set|UCS]]-2 (without full support for Unicode), a precursor of UTF-16; [[GB 18030|GB18030]] is standardized in China and implements Unicode fully, while not an official Unicode standard.\n\nUTF-8, the dominant encoding on the [[World Wide Web]] (used in over 94% of websites {{As of|2019|November|df=|lc=y}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/character_encoding/ranking|title=Usage Survey of Character Encodings broken down by Ranking|website=w3techs.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> uses one [[byte]] for the first 128 [[code point]]s, and up to 4 bytes for other characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#I1.36559|work=The Unicode Standard|title=Conformance | date=March 2020|accessdate=2020-03-15}}</ref> The first 128 Unicode code points represent the [[ASCII]] characters, which means that any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text.\n\nUCS-2 uses two bytes (16&nbsp;bits) for each character but can only encode the first 65,536 code points, the so-called [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP).  With 1,112,064 possible Unicode code points corresponding to characters (see [[#Architecture and terminology|below]]) on 17 planes, and with over 143,000 code points defined as of version 13.0, UCS-2 is only able to represent less than half of all encoded Unicode characters.  Therefore, UCS-2 is outdated, though still widely used in software.  UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same [[16-bit]] encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in the reserved range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is valid UTF-16 text.\n\nUTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character. Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all Unicode code points. However, because each character uses four bytes, UTF-32 takes significantly more space than other encodings, and is not widely used.\n\n==Origin and development==\nUnicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing (usually using [[Latin character]]s and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other).\n\nUnicode, in intent, encodes the underlying characters\u2014[[grapheme]]s and grapheme-like units\u2014rather than the variant [[glyph]]s (renderings) for such characters. In the case of [[Chinese characters]], this sometimes leads to controversies over distinguishing the underlying character from its variant glyphs (see [[Han unification]]).\n\nIn text processing, Unicode takes the role of providing a unique ''code point''\u2014a [[number]], not a glyph\u2014for each character. In other words, Unicode represents a character in an abstract way and leaves the visual rendering (size, shape, [[font]], or style) to other software, such as a [[web browser]] or [[word processor]]. This simple aim becomes complicated, however, because of concessions made by Unicode's designers in the hope of encouraging a more rapid adoption of Unicode.\n\nThe first 256 code points were made identical to the content of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] so as to make it trivial to convert existing western text. Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve distinctions used by legacy encodings and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to Unicode (and back) without losing any information. For example, the \"[[Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (Unicode block)|fullwidth forms]]\" section of code points encompasses a full duplicate of the Latin alphabet because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ([[CJK]]) fonts contain two versions of these letters, \"fullwidth\" matching the width of the CJK characters, and normal width. For other examples, see [[duplicate characters in Unicode]].\n\n==={{anchor|Unicode 88}}History===\nBased on experiences with the [[Xerox Character Code Standard]] (XCCS) since 1980,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> the origins of Unicode date to 1987, when [[Joe Becker (Unicode)|Joe Becker]] from [[Xerox]] with [[Lee Collins (software engineer)|Lee Collins]] and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], started investigating the practicalities of creating a universal character set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Summary Narrative |url=https://www.unicode.org/history/summary.html |access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref> With additional input from Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad,<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/> Joe Becker published a draft proposal for an \"international/multilingual text character encoding system in August 1988, tentatively called Unicode\".

Its fundamental differences from XCCS were proposed by Peter Fenwick and Dave Opstad (pure 16-bit codes), and by [[Lee Collins (Unicode)|Lee Collins]] (ideographic character unification). Unicode retains the many features of XCCS whose utility have been proved over the years in an international line of communication multilingual system products.}}</ref>\n\nIn this document, entitled ''Unicode 88'', Becker outlined a [[16-bit]] character model:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode is intended to address the need for a workable, reliable world text encoding. Unicode could be roughly described as \"wide-body ASCII\" that has been stretched to 16&nbsp;bits to encompass the characters of all the world's living languages. In a properly engineered design, 16&nbsp;bits per character are more than sufficient for this purpose.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis original 16-bit design was based on the assumption that only those scripts and characters in modern use would need to be encoded:<ref name=\"unicode-88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\nUnicode gives higher priority to ensuring utility for the future than to preserving past antiquities. Unicode aims in the first instance at the characters published in modern text (e.g. in the union of all newspapers and magazines printed in the world in 1988), whose number is undoubtedly far below 2<sup>14</sup> = 16,384. Beyond those modern-use characters, all others may be defined to be obsolete or rare; these are better candidates for private-use registration than for congesting the public list of generally useful Unicodes.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn early 1989, the Unicode working group expanded to include Ken Whistler and Mike Kernaghan of Metaphor, Karen Smith-Yoshimura and Joan Aliprand of [[Research Libraries Group|RLG]], and Glenn Wright of [[Sun Microsystems]], and in 1990, Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag from [[Microsoft]] and Rick McGowan of [[NeXT]] joined the group. By the end of 1990, most of the work on mapping existing character encoding standards had been completed, and a final review draft of Unicode was ready.\n\nThe [[Unicode Consortium]] was incorporated in California on 3 January 1991,<ref>[https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html History of Unicode Release and Publication Dates] on ''unicode.org.'' Retrieved February 28, 2017.</ref> and in October 1991, the first volume of the Unicode standard was published. The second volume, covering Han ideographs, was published in June 1992.\n\nIn 1996, a surrogate character mechanism was implemented in Unicode 2.0, so that Unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits. This increased the Unicode codespace to over a million code points, which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts (e.g., [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding. Among the characters not originally intended for Unicode are rarely used Kanji or Chinese characters, many of which are part of personal and place names, making them rarely used, but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of Unicode.<ref name=unicoderevisited>{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Stephen J|title=Unicode Revisited|url=http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/unicoderevisited.html|accessdate=2013-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Microsoft TrueType specification version 1.0 from 1992 used the name ''Apple Unicode'' instead of ''Unicode'' for the Platform ID in the naming table.\n\n===Unicode Consortium===\n{{Main|Unicode Consortium}}\n\nThe Unicode Consortium is a nonprofit organization that coordinates Unicode's development.

Out of these 2<sup>16</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> defined code points, the code points from U+D800 through U+DFFF, which are used to encode surrogate pairs in [[UTF-16]], are reserved by the Standard and may not be used to encode valid characters, resulting in a net total of 2<sup>16</sup> &minus; 2<sup>11</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup> = 1,112,064 possible code points corresponding to valid Unicode characters.  Not all of these code points necessarily correspond to visible characters; several, for example, are assigned to control codes such as [[carriage return]].\n\n===Code point planes and blocks===\n{{Main|Plane (Unicode)}}\nThe Unicode codespace is divided into seventeen ''planes'', numbered 0 to 16:\n\n{{Planes (Unicode)}}\n\nAll code points in the BMP are accessed as a single code unit in [[UTF-16]] encoding and can be encoded in one, two or three bytes in [[UTF-8]]. Code points in Planes 1 through 16 (''supplementary planes'') are accessed as surrogate pairs in UTF-16 and encoded in four bytes in UTF-8.\n\nWithin each plane, characters are allocated within named ''[[Block (Unicode)|blocks]]'' of related characters. Although blocks are an arbitrary size, they are always a multiple of 16 code points and often a multiple of 128 code points. Characters required for a given script may be spread out over several different blocks.\n\n===General Category property===\nEach code point has a single [[Character property (Unicode)#General Category|General Category]] property. The major categories are denoted: Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol, Separator and Other. Within these categories, there are subdivisions. In most cases other properties must be used to sufficiently specify the characteristics of a code point. The possible General Categories are:\n\n{{General Category (Unicode)}}\n\nCode points in the range U+D800\u2013U+DBFF (1,024 code points) are known as high-'''surrogate''' code points, and code points in the range U+DC00\u2013U+DFFF (1,024 code points) are known as low-surrogate code points. A high-surrogate code point followed by a low-surrogate code point form a surrogate pair in [[UTF-16]] to represent code points greater than U+FFFF. These code points otherwise cannot be used (this rule is ignored often in practice especially when not using UTF-16).\n\nA small set of code points are guaranteed never to be used for encoding characters, although applications may make use of these code points internally if they wish. There are sixty-six of these '''noncharacters''': U+FDD0\u2013U+FDEF and any code point ending in the value FFFE or FFFF (i.e., U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, \u2026 U+10FFFE, U+10FFFF). The set of noncharacters is stable, and no new noncharacters will ever be defined.<ref name=\"stability-policy\">{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy\n| url = https://unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> Like surrogates, the rule that these cannot be used is often ignored, although the operation of the [[byte order mark]] assumes that U+FFFE will never be the first code point in a text.\n\nExcluding surrogates and noncharacters leaves 1,111,998 code points available for use.\n\n'''Private-use''' code points are considered to be assigned characters, but they have no interpretation specified by the Unicode standard<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Properties\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch03.pdf#G43463\n| accessdate = 2020-03-15 }}\n</ref> so any interchange of such characters requires an agreement between sender and receiver on their interpretation. There are three private-use areas in the Unicode codespace:\n\n* Private Use Area: U+E000\u2013U+F8FF (6,400 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-A: U+F0000\u2013U+FFFFD (65,534 characters)\n* Supplementary Private Use Area-B: U+100000\u2013U+10FFFD (65,534 characters).\n\nGraphic characters are characters defined by Unicode to have particular semantics, and either have a visible [[glyph]] shape or represent a visible space. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 143,696 graphic characters.\n\n'''Format''' characters are characters that do not have a visible appearance, but may have an effect on the appearance or behavior of neighboring characters. For example, {{unichar|200C|Zero-width non-joiner|nlink=}} and {{unichar|200D|Zero-width joiner|nlink=}} may be used to change the default shaping behavior of adjacent characters (e.g., to inhibit ligatures or request ligature formation). There are 163 format characters in Unicode 13.0.\n\nSixty-five code points (U+0000\u2013U+001F and U+007F\u2013U+009F) are reserved as '''control''' codes, and correspond to the [[C0 and C1 control codes]] defined in [[ISO/IEC 6429]]. U+0009 (Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), and U+000D (Carriage Return) are widely used in Unicode-encoded texts. In practice the C1 code points are often improperly-translated ([[Mojibake]]) legacy [[Windows-1252]] characters used by some English and Western European texts with Windows technologies.\n\nGraphic characters, format characters, control code characters, and private use characters are known collectively as ''assigned characters''. '''Reserved''' code points are those code points which are available for use, but are not yet assigned. As of Unicode 13.0 there are 830,606 reserved code points.\n\n===Abstract characters===\nThe set of graphic and format characters defined by Unicode does not correspond directly to the repertoire of ''abstract characters'' that is representable under Unicode. Unicode encodes characters by associating an abstract character with a particular code point.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Character Encoding Model\n| url = https://unicode.org/reports/tr17/\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref> However, not all abstract characters are encoded as a single Unicode character, and some abstract characters may be represented in Unicode by a sequence of two or more characters. For example, a Latin small letter \"i\" with an [[ogonek]], a [[dot above]], and an [[acute accent]], which is required in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], is represented by the character sequence U+012F, U+0307, U+0301. Unicode maintains a list of uniquely named character sequences for abstract characters that are not directly encoded in Unicode.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Named Sequences\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamedSequences.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}\n</ref>\n\nAll graphic, format, and private use characters have a unique and immutable name by which they may be identified. This immutability has been guaranteed since Unicode version 2.0 by the Name Stability policy.<ref name=\"stability-policy\" /> In cases where the name is seriously defective and misleading, or has a serious typographical error, a formal alias may be defined, and applications are encouraged to use the formal alias in place of the official character name. For example, {{unichar|A015|YI SYLLABLE WU}} has the formal alias {{sc2|YI SYLLABLE ITERATION MARK}}, and {{unichar|FE18|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''KC'''ET|note=[[sic]]}} has the formal alias {{sc2|PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRA'''CK'''ET}}.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Unicode Name Aliases\n| url = https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt\n| accessdate = 2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\n===Ready-made versus composite characters===\nUnicode includes a mechanism for modifying characters that greatly extends the supported glyph repertoire. This covers the use of [[combining diacritical mark]]s that may be added after the base character by the user. Multiple combining diacritics may be simultaneously applied to the same character. Unicode also contains [[precomposed character|precomposed]] versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters. For example, ''\u00e9'' can be represented in Unicode as [[#Upluslink|U+]]0065 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E}}) followed by U+0301 ({{sc2|COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}}), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 ({{sc2|LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE}}). Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character. To deal with this, Unicode provides the mechanism of [[canonical equivalence]].\n\nAn example of this arises with [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet. Unicode provides a mechanism for composing Hangul syllables with their individual subcomponents, known as [[Hangul Jamo]]. However, it also provides 11,172 combinations of precomposed syllables made from the most common jamo.\n\nThe [[CJK]] characters currently have codes only for their precomposed form. Still, most of those characters comprise simpler elements (called [[Radical_(Chinese_characters)|radicals]]), so in principle Unicode could have decomposed them as it did with Hangul. This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points, while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable character (which might do away with some of the problems caused by [[Han unification]]). A similar idea is used by some [[input method]]s, such as [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] and [[Wubi method|Wubi]]. However, attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that Chinese characters do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does.\n\nA set of [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] was provided in Unicode 3.0 (CJK radicals between U+2E80 and U+2EFF, KangXi radicals in U+2F00 to U+2FDF, and ideographic description characters from U+2FF0 to U+2FFB), but the Unicode standard (ch. 12.2 of Unicode 5.2) warns against using [[Ideographic Description Sequences|ideographic description sequences]] as an alternate representation for previously encoded characters:\n\n{{quote|This process is different from a formal ''encoding'' of an ideograph. There is no canonical description of unencoded ideographs; there is no semantic assigned to described ideographs; there is no equivalence defined for described ideographs. Conceptually, ideographic descriptions are more akin to the English phrase \"an 'e' with an acute accent on it\" than to the character sequence &lt;U+0065, U+0301&gt;.}}\n\n===Ligatures===\nMany scripts, including [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Devanagari|Devan\u0101gar\u012b]], have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special [[ligature (typography)|ligature forms]]. The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE (Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard), which became the [[proof of concept]] for [[OpenType]] (by Adobe and Microsoft), [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] (by [[SIL International]]), or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] (by Apple).\n\nInstructions are also embedded in fonts to tell the [[operating system]] how to properly output different character sequences. A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with). A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs. Real stacking is impossible, but can be approximated in limited cases (for example, Thai top-combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with). Generally this approach is only effective in monospaced fonts, but may be used as a fallback rendering method when more complex methods fail.\n\n===Standardized subsets===\nSeveral subsets of Unicode are standardized: Microsoft Windows since [[Windows NT 4.0]] supports [[WGL-4]] with 656 characters, which is considered to support all contemporary European languages using the Latin, Greek, or Cyrillic script. Other standardized subsets of Unicode include the Multilingual European Subsets:<ref>[https://www.evertype.com/standards/iso10646/pdf/cwa13873.pdf CWA 13873:2000&nbsp;\u2013 Multilingual European Subsets in ISO/IEC 10646-1] [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] Workshop Agreement 13873</ref>\n\nMES-1 (Latin scripts only, 335 characters), MES-2 (Latin, Greek and Cyrillic 1062 characters)<ref>[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/mes-2-rationale.html Multilingual European Character Set 2 (MES-2) Rationale], [[Markus Kuhn (computer scientist)|Markus Kuhn]], 1998</ref> and MES-3A & MES-3B (two larger subsets, not shown here).

Some systems have made attempts to provide more information about such characters. Apple's [[Last Resort font]] will display a substitute glyph indicating the Unicode range of the character, and the [[SIL International]]'s [[Unicode fallback font|Unicode Fallback]] font will display a box showing the hexadecimal scalar value of the character.\n\n==={{anchor|UTF|UCS}}Mapping and encodings===\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been specified for storing a series of code points as a series of bytes.\n\n<!-- [[Unicode Transformation Format]] redirects here -->\nUnicode defines two mapping methods: the ''Unicode Transformation Format'' (UTF) encodings, and the ''[[Universal Coded Character Set]]'' (UCS) encodings. An encoding maps (possibly a subset of) the range of Unicode ''code points'' to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed ''code units''. All UTF encodings map code points to a unique sequence of bytes.<ref>{{cite web|title=UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM|url=https://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html|website=Unicode.org FAQ|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits per code unit (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per code unit (for UCS encodings and UTF-1). UTF-8 and UTF-16 are the most commonly used encodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent.\n\nUTF encodings include:\n\n* [[UTF-1]], a retired predecessor of UTF-8, maximizes compatibility with [[ISO/IEC 2022|ISO 2022]], no longer part of ''The Unicode Standard''\n* [[UTF-7]], a 7-bit encoding sometimes used in e-mail, often considered obsolete (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'', but only documented as an informational [[Request for Comments|RFC]], i.e., not on the Internet Standards Track)\n* [[UTF-8]], uses one to four bytes for each code point, maximizes compatibility with [[ASCII]]\n* [[UTF-EBCDIC]], similar to UTF-8 but designed for compatibility with [[EBCDIC]] (not part of ''The Unicode Standard'')\n* [[UTF-16]], uses one or two 16-bit code units per code point, cannot encode surrogates\n* [[UTF-32]], uses one 32-bit code unit per code point\n\nUTF-8 uses one to four bytes per code point and, being compact for Latin scripts and ASCII-compatible, provides the ''de facto'' standard encoding for interchange of Unicode text. It is used by [[FreeBSD]] and most recent [[Linux distributions]] as a direct replacement for legacy encodings in general text handling.\n\nThe UCS-2 and UTF-16 encodings specify the Unicode [[Byte Order Mark]] (BOM) for use at the beginnings of text files, which may be used for byte ordering detection (or [[endianness|byte endianness]] detection). The BOM, code point U+FEFF has the important property of unambiguity on byte reorder, regardless of the Unicode encoding used; U+FFFE (the result of byte-swapping U+FEFF) does not equate to a legal character, and U+FEFF in other places, other than the beginning of text, conveys the zero-width non-break space (a character with no appearance and no effect other than preventing the formation of [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]]).\n\nThe same character converted to UTF-8 becomes the byte sequence <code>EF BB BF</code>. The Unicode Standard allows that the BOM \"can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked\".<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.2 | publisher=The Unicode Consortium | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-936213-08-5 | page=561 }}</ref> Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings, including UTF-8, in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit [[code page]]s. However {{IETF RFC|3629}}, the UTF-8 standard, recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8, but discusses the cases where this may not be possible. In addition, the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 (for instance there cannot be any lone bytes with the high bit set) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM.\n\nIn UTF-32 and UCS-4, one [[32-bit]] code unit serves as a fairly direct representation of any character's code point (although the endianness, which varies across different platforms, affects how the code unit manifests as a byte sequence). In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code units. UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] compilers to generate software uses it as the standard \"[[wide character]]\" encoding. Some programming languages, such as [[Seed7]], use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters. Recent versions of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language (beginning with 2.2) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings, effectively disseminating such encoding in [[high-level programming language|high-level]] coded software.\n\n[[Punycode]], another encoding form, enables the encoding of Unicode strings into the limited character set supported by the [[ASCII]]-based [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). The encoding is used as part of [[IDNA]], which is a system enabling the use of [[Internationalized Domain Names]] in all scripts that are supported by Unicode. Earlier and now historical proposals include [[UTF-5]] and [[UTF-6]].\n\n[[GB 18030|GB18030]] is another encoding form for Unicode, from the [[Standardization Administration of China]]. It is the official [[character set]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU-1]] and [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]] are Unicode compression schemes. The [[April Fools' Day RFC]] of 2005 specified two [[parody]] UTF encodings, [[UTF-9]] and [[UTF-18]].\n\n==Adoption==\n\n===Operating systems===\nUnicode has become the dominant scheme for internal processing and storage of text. Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems. Early adopters tended to use [[UCS-2]] (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to UTF-16) and later moved to [[UTF-16]] (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is [[Windows NT]] (and its descendants, [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]]), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The [[Java virtual machine|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] bytecode environments, [[macOS]], and [[KDE]] also use it for internal representation. Partial support for Unicode can be installed on [[Windows 9x]] through the [[Microsoft Layer for Unicode]].\n\n[[UTF-8]] (originally developed for [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]])<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt\n | title = UTF-8 history\n | first = Rob | last = Pike | authorlink = Rob Pike\n | date = 2003-04-30\n}}</ref> has become the main storage encoding on most [[Unix-like]] operating systems (though others are also used by some libraries) because it is a relatively easy replacement for traditional [[extended ASCII]] character sets. UTF-8 is also the most common Unicode encoding used in [[HTML]] documents on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\nMultilingual text-rendering engines which use Unicode include [[Uniscribe]] and [[DirectWrite]] for Microsoft Windows, [[ATSUI]] and [[Core Text]] for macOS, and [[Pango]] for [[GTK+]] and the [[GNOME]] desktop.\n\n===Input methods===\n{{Main|Unicode input}}\n\nBecause keyboard layouts cannot have simple key combinations for all characters, several operating systems provide alternative input methods that allow access to the entire repertoire.\n\n[[ISO/IEC 14755]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/ISO-14755.pdf |title=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 18/WG 9 N |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> which standardises methods for entering Unicode characters from their code points, specifies several methods. There is the ''Basic method'', where a ''beginning sequence'' is followed by the hexadecimal representation of the code point and the ''ending sequence''. There is also a ''screen-selection entry method'' specified, where the characters are listed in a table in a screen, such as with a character map program.\n\nOnline tools for finding the code point for a known character include Unicode Lookup<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unicodelookup.com/|title=Unicode Lookup|last=Hedley|first=Jonathan|date=2009}}</ref> by Jonathan Hedley and Shapecatcher<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shapecatcher.com/|title=Unicode Character Recognition|last=Milde|first=Benjamin|date=2011}}</ref> by Benjamin Milde. In Unicode Lookup, one enters a search key (e.g. \"fractions\"), and a list of corresponding characters with their code points is returned. In Shapecatcher, based on [[Shape context]], one draws the character in a box and a list of characters approximating the drawing, with their code points, is returned.\n\n===Email===\n{{Main|Unicode and email}}\n\n[[MIME]] defines two different mechanisms for encoding non-ASCII characters in [[email]], depending on whether the characters are in email headers (such as the \"Subject:\"), or in the text body of the message; in both cases, the original character set is identified as well as a transfer encoding. For email transmission of Unicode, the [[UTF-8]] character set and the [[Base64]] or the [[Quoted-printable]] transfer encoding are recommended, depending on whether much of the message consists of [[ASCII]] characters. The details of the two different mechanisms are specified in the MIME standards and generally are hidden from users of email software.\n\nThe adoption of Unicode in email has been very slow. Some East Asian text is still encoded in encodings such as [[ISO-2022]], and some devices, such as mobile phones, still cannot correctly handle Unicode data. Support has been improving, however. Many major free mail providers such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] ([[Gmail]]), and [[Microsoft]] ([[Outlook.com]]) support it.\n\n===Web===\n{{Main|Unicode and HTML}}\n\nAll [[W3C]] recommendations have used Unicode as their ''document character set'' since HTML 4.0. [[Web browser]]s have supported Unicode, especially UTF-8, for many years. There used to be display problems resulting primarily from [[typeface|font]] related issues; e.g. v 6 and older of Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]] did not render many code points unless explicitly told to use a font that contains them.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan |last=Wood |url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/explorer.html#ie5 |title=Setting up Windows Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6 for Multilingual and Unicode Support |publisher=Alan Wood |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough syntax rules may affect the order in which characters are allowed to appear, [[XML]] (including [[XHTML]]) documents, by definition,<ref>{{cite web|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 (Second Edition)|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11|accessdate=2013-11-01}}</ref> comprise characters from most of the Unicode code points, with the exception of:\n\n* most of the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0 control codes]]\n* the permanently unassigned code points D800\u2013DFFF\n* FFFE or FFFF\n\nHTML characters manifest either directly as [[byte]]s according to document's encoding, if the encoding supports them, or users may write them as numeric character references based on the character's Unicode code point. For example, the references <code>&amp;#916;</code>, <code>&amp;#1049;</code>, <code>&amp;#1511;</code>, <code>&amp;#1605;</code>, <code>&amp;#3671;</code>, <code>&amp;#12354;</code>, <code>&amp;#21494;</code>, <code>&amp;#33865;</code>, and <code>&amp;#47568;</code> (or the same numeric values expressed in hexadecimal, with <code>&amp;#x</code> as the prefix) should display on all browsers as \u0394, \u0419, \u05e7 ,\u0645, \u0e57, \u3042, \u53f6, \u8449, and \ub9d0.\n\nWhen specifying [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]], for example as [[URL]]s in [[HTTP]] requests, non-ASCII characters must be [[percent encoding|percent-encoded]].\n\n===Fonts===\n{{Main|Unicode font}}\n\nUnicode is not in principle concerned with fonts ''per se'', seeing them as implementation choices.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/wiley/journals/epobetan/pdf/volume6/issue3/bigelow.pdf  | title = The design of a Unicode font | journal = Electronic Publishing | volume = VOL. 6(3), 289\u2013305 | date = September 1993 | page = 292 |last1 = Bigelow | first1=Charles | last2 = Holmes | first2 = Kris}}</ref> Any given character may have many [[allograph]]s, from the more common bold, italic and base letterforms to complex decorative styles. A font is \"Unicode compliant\" if the glyphs in the font can be accessed using code points defined in the Unicode standard.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.unicode.org/faq/font_keyboard.html | title = Fonts and keyboards | publisher = Unicode Consortium | date = 28 June 2017 | accessdate= 13 October 2019}}</ref> The standard does not specify a minimum number of characters that must be included in the font; some fonts have quite a small repertoire.\n\nFree and retail [[font]]s based on Unicode are widely available, since [[TrueType]] and [[OpenType]] support Unicode. These font formats map Unicode code points to glyphs, but TrueType font is restricted to 65,535 glyphs.\n\n[[List of typefaces|Thousands of fonts]] exist on the market, but fewer than a dozen fonts\u2014sometimes described as \"pan-Unicode\" fonts\u2014attempt to support the majority of Unicode's character repertoire. Instead, Unicode-based [[List of Unicode fonts|fonts]] typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols. Several reasons justify this approach: applications and documents rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed, i.e., [[font substitution]]. Furthermore, designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task; such a venture passes the point of [[diminishing returns]] for most typefaces.\n\n===Newlines===\nUnicode partially addresses the [[newline]] problem that occurs when trying to read a text file on different platforms. Unicode defines a large number of [[Newline#Unicode|characters]] that conforming applications should recognize as line terminators.\n\nIn terms of the newline, Unicode introduced {{unichar|2028|LINE SEPARATOR}} and {{unichar|2029|PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR}}. This was an attempt to provide a Unicode solution to encoding paragraphs and lines semantically, potentially replacing all of the various platform solutions. In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions. Nonetheless, few if any Unicode solutions have adopted these Unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters. However, a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization. This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML and HTML recommendations. In this approach every possible newline character is converted internally to a common newline (which one does not really matter since it is an internal operation just for rendering). In other words, the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual encoding.\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Philosophical and completeness criticisms===\n[[Han unification]] (the identification of forms in the [[East Asian language]]s which one can treat as stylistic variations of the same historical character) has become one of the most controversial aspects of Unicode, despite the presence of a majority of experts from all three regions in the [[Ideographic Research Group]] (IRG), which advises the Consortium and ISO on additions to the repertoire and on Han unification.<ref>[http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html A Brief History of Character Codes], Steven J. Searle, originally written [https://web.archive.org/web/20001216022100/http://tronweb.super-nova.co.jp/characcodehist.html 1999], last updated 2004</ref>\n\nUnicode has been criticized for failing to separately encode older and alternative forms of [[kanji]] which, critics argue, complicates the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names. This is often due to the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than glyphs (the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another). Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves, not just the basic character representation, are being merged.<ref name=\"dw2001\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130625062705/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/u-secret.html The secret life of Unicode: A peek at Unicode's soft underbelly], Suzanne Topping, 1 May 2001 ''(Internet Archive)''</ref>{{clarify|date=April 2010|reason=\"and, contains\" and meaning of statement}} There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification. An example of one is [[TRON (encoding)|TRON]] (although it is not widely adopted in Japan, there are some users who need to handle historical Japanese text and favor it).\n\nAlthough the repertoire of fewer than 21,000 Han characters in the earliest version of Unicode was largely limited to characters in common modern usage, Unicode now includes more than 92,000 Han characters, and work is continuing to add thousands more historic and dialectal characters used in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\n\nModern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations, in the form of [[variation Selectors|Unicode variation sequences]]. For example, the Advanced Typographic tables of [[OpenType]] permit one of a number of alternative glyph representations to be selected when performing the character to glyph mapping process. In this case, information can be provided within plain text to designate which alternate character form to select.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|right|Various [[Cyrillic]] characters shown with and without italics]]\nIf the difference in the appropriate glyphs for two characters in the same script differ only in the italic, Unicode has generally unified them, as can be seen in the comparison between Russian (labeled standard) and Serbian characters at right, meaning that the differences are displayed through smart font technology or manually changing fonts.\n\n===Mapping to legacy character sets===\nUnicode was designed to provide code-point-by-code-point [[round-trip format conversion]] to and from any preexisting character encodings, so that text files in older character sets can be converted to Unicode and then back and get back the same file, without employing context-dependent interpretation. That has meant that inconsistent legacy architectures, such as [[combining character|combining diacritics]] and [[precomposed character]]s, both exist in Unicode, giving more than one method of representing some text. This is most pronounced in the three different encoding forms for Korean [[Hangul]]. Since version 3.0, any precomposed characters that can be represented by a combining sequence of already existing characters can no longer be added to the standard in order to preserve interoperability between software using different versions of Unicode.\n\n[[Injective]] mappings must be provided between characters in existing legacy character sets and characters in Unicode to facilitate conversion to Unicode and allow interoperability with legacy software. Lack of consistency in various mappings between earlier Japanese encodings such as [[Shift-JIS]] or [[EUC-JP]] and Unicode led to [[round-trip format conversion]] mismatches, particularly the mapping of the character JIS X 0208 '\uff5e' (1-33, WAVE DASH), heavily used in legacy database data, to either {{unichar|FF5E|FULLWIDTH TILDE}} (in [[Microsoft Windows]]) or {{unichar|301C|WAVE DASH}} (other vendors).<ref>\n[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2166.doc AFII contribution about WAVE DASH], {{Cite web|url=http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422181018/http://www.ingrid.org/java/i18n/unicode.html|title=An Unicode vendor-specific character table for japanese|date=2011-04-22|archive-date=2011-04-22|website=web.archive.org<!--|access-date=2019-05-20-->}}</ref>\n\nSome Japanese computer programmers objected to Unicode because it requires them to separate the use of {{unichar|005C|REVERSE SOLIDUS|note=backslash}} and {{unichar|00A5|YEN SIGN}}, which was mapped to 0x5C in JIS X 0201, and a lot of legacy code exists with this usage.<ref>[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/intro-i18n/ch-codes.en.html#s-646problem ''ISO 646-* Problem''], Section 4.4.3.5 of ''Introduction to I18n'', Tomohiro KUBOTA, 2001</ref> (This encoding also replaces tilde '~' 0x7E with macron '\u00af', now 0xAF.) The separation of these characters exists in [[ISO 8859-1]], from long before Unicode.\n\n===Indic scripts===\n[[Indic script]]s such as [[Tamil script|Tamil]] and [[Devanagari]] are each allocated only 128 code points, matching the [[ISCII]] standard. The correct rendering of Unicode Indic text requires transforming the stored logical order characters into visual order and the forming of ligatures (aka conjuncts) out of components. Some local scholars argued in favor of assignments of Unicode code points to these ligatures, going against the practice for other writing systems, though Unicode contains some Arabic and other ligatures for backward compatibility purposes only.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-A\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB50.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Arabic Presentation Forms-B\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE70.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Alphabetic Presentation Forms\n| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB00.pdf\n| accessdate = 2010-03-20}}</ref> Encoding of any new ligatures in Unicode will not happen, in part because the set of ligatures is font-dependent, and Unicode is an encoding independent of font variations. The same kind of issue arose for the [[Tibetan script]] in 2003 when the [[Standardization Administration of China]] proposed encoding 956 precomposed Tibetan syllables,<ref>{{Cite web | author=China | title=Proposal on Tibetan BrdaRten Characters Encoding for ISO/IEC 10646 in BMP | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02455-n2558-tibetan.pdf | date=2 December 2002 }}</ref> but these were rejected for encoding by the relevant ISO committee ([[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]]).<ref>{{Cite web | author= V. S. Umamaheswaran | title=Resolutions of WG 2 meeting 44 | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03390r-n2654.pdf | at=Resolution M44.20 | date=7 November 2003 }}</ref>\n\n[[Thai alphabet]] support has been criticized for its ordering of Thai characters. The vowels \u0e40, \u0e41, \u0e42, \u0e43, \u0e44 that are written to the left of the preceding consonant are in visual order instead of phonetic order, unlike the Unicode representations of other Indic scripts. This complication is due to Unicode inheriting the [[TIS-620|Thai Industrial Standard 620]], which worked in the same way, and was the way in which Thai had always been written on keyboards. This ordering problem complicates the Unicode collation process slightly, requiring table lookups to reorder Thai characters for collation.<ref name=\"dw2001\" /> Even if Unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order, it would still be problematic to collate words in dictionary order. E.g., the word {{wiktth|\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e07}} {{IPA-th|sa d\u025b\u02d0\u014b|}} \"perform\" starts with a consonant cluster \"\u0e2a\u0e14\" (with an inherent vowel for the consonant \"\u0e2a\"), the vowel \u0e41-, in spoken order would come after the \u0e14, but in a dictionary, the word is collated as it is written, with the vowel following the \u0e2a.\n\n===Combining characters===\n{{Main|Combining character}}\n{{See also|Unicode normalization#Normalization}}\n\nCharacters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non-spacing marks. For example, \u1e17 (precomposed e with macron and acute above) and e&#772;&#769; (e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above) should be rendered identically, both appearing as an [[e]] with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] and [[acute accent]], but in practice, their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters. Similarly, [[dot (diacritic)|underdots]], as needed in the [[romanization]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], will often be placed incorrectly.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases, thus avoiding the problem, but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as [[Charis SIL]] that uses [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]], [[OpenType]], or [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]] technologies for advanced rendering features.\n\n===Anomalies===\n{{main|Unicode alias names and abbreviations}}\nThe Unicode standard has imposed rules intended to guarantee stability.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html Unicode stability policy]</ref> Depending on the strictness of a rule, a change can be prohibited or allowed. For example, a \"name\" given to a code point cannot and will not change. But a \"script\" property is more flexible, by Unicode's own rules. In version 2.0, Unicode changed many code point \"names\" from version 1. At the same moment, Unicode stated that from then on, an assigned name to a code point will never change anymore. This implies that when mistakes are published, these mistakes cannot be corrected, even if they are trivial (as happened in one instance with the spelling {{sc2|{{typo|BRAKCET}}}} for {{sc2|BRACKET}} in a character name). In 2006 a list of anomalies in character names was first published, and, as of April 2017, there were 94 characters with identified issues,<ref name=\"tn17\">{{cite web |url=https://unicode.org/notes/tn27/ |title=Unicode Technical Note #27: Known Anomalies in Unicode Character Names |date=10 April 2017 |website=unicode.org}}</ref> for example:\n\n* {{unichar|2118|script capital p|nlink=Weierstrass p}}: This is a small letter.

professional [[tennis]] player from [[Brazil]].\n\nBorn in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], she started playing tennis at the age of 4, when she went to an academy along with her father. At the age of 14, Menga went to train tennis in [[Barcelona]], where she won her first doubles championship.\n\nShe's the only Brazilian female tennis player to play in two [[Summer Olympic Games]], [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta 1996]] (doubles with Miriam D\u2019Agostini, falling in Round 1), and [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000]] (with Joana Cortez, falling in Round 2). Menga was also in two [[Pan American Games]], [[1995 Pan American Games|Mar Del Plata 1995]] and [[1999 Pan American Games|Winnipeg 1999]], where she won the doubles Gold medal with Joana Cortez.\n\nIn 2001, Menga posed for [[Playboy magazine (Brazilian issue)|''Playboy'' Brazil]]. In 2003, she retired from tennis after a motorcycle accident which left her for eight months without  playing. Menga now has an institute in S\u00e3o Paulo where she teaches tennis to over 200 children, and participates in other charity projects.\n\n==ITF finals==\n=== Singles: 9 (3\u20136) ===\n\n{|
