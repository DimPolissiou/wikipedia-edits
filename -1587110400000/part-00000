English names for it include '''lebbeck''', '''lebbek tree''', '''flea tree''', '''frywood''', '''koko''' and '''woman's tongue tree'''. The latter name is a play on the sound the seeds make as they rattle inside the pods. Being one of the most widespread and common species of ''Albizia'' worldwide, it is often simply called '''siris''', though this name may refer to any locally common member of the [[genus]].<ref name=\"USDA 1994\"/>\n\nIt is a [[tree]] growing to a height of 18\u201330 m tall with a trunk 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m in diameter. The [[leaf|leaves]] are bipinnate, 7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm long, with one to four pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 6\u201318 leaflets.

Similarly , 'vaagai' means 'victory' in Tamil.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[Image:Bark of Albizia lebbeck.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bark of ''Albizia lebbeck'']]\nIts uses include environmental management,  [[Fodder|forage]], medicine and wood.  It is cultivated as a shade tree in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name = ildis>ILDIS (2005)</ref> In India and Pakistan, the tree is used to produce [[timber]].

For example, the [[greater rhea]] (''Rhea americana'') has been observed feeding on it in the [[cerrado]] of [[Brazil]].<ref>Schetini de Azevedo ''et al.'' (2006)</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nLebbeck is an [[astringent]], also used by some cultures to treat boils, [[cough]], to treat the [[human eye|eye]], [[flu]], [[gingivitis]], [[human lung|lung]] problems, pectoral problems, is used as a tonic, and is used to treat abdominal [[tumor]]s.<ref>Duke (2008)</ref> The bark is used medicinally to treat [[inflammation]].<ref>Lowry ''et al.''(1994)</ref> This information was obtained via [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanical records]], which are a reference to how a plant is used by indigenous peoples, not verifiable, scientific or medical evaluation of the effectiveness of these claims. ''Albizia lebbeck'' is also [[psychoactive]].<ref>R\u00e4tsch (2004)</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history of ''A. lebbeck'' is somewhat convoluted. It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Mimosa lebbeck''. [[George Bentham]] placed the [[species]] in its present [[genus]], but other authors believed that the plant described by Linnaeus was the related ''[[Albizia kalkora]]'' as described by Prain (based on the ''Mimosa kalkora'' of [[William Roxburgh]]), and erroneously referred to this species as ''Albizia lebbeck''. However, [[Francisco Manuel Blanco]] used ''Mimosa lebbeck'' to refer to ''[[Albizia retusa]]'' ssp. ''retusa''. In addition, the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is occasionally misspelled ''lebbek''.<ref>USDA (1994), ILDIS (2005)</ref>\n\n[[Junior synonym]]s are:<ref name = ildis />\n* ''Acacia lebbeck'' <small>(L.)

It is cultivated as a shade tree in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name = ildis>ILDIS (2005)</ref> In India and Pakistan, the tree is used to produce [[timber]]. Wood from ''Albizia lebbeck'' has a density of 0.55-0.66 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or higher.<ref>Brown (1997)</ref>\n\nEven where it is not native, some indigenous [[herbivore]]s are liable to utilize lebbeck as a food resource. For example, the [[greater rhea]] (''Rhea americana'') has been observed feeding on it in the [[cerrado]] of [[Brazil]].<ref>Schetini de Azevedo ''et al.'' (2006)</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nLebbeck is an [[astringent]], also used by some cultures to treat boils, [[cough]], to treat the [[human eye|eye]], [[flu]], [[gingivitis]], [[human lung|lung]] problems, pectoral problems, is used as a tonic, and is used to treat abdominal [[tumor]]s.<ref>Duke (2008)</ref> The bark is used medicinally to treat [[inflammation]].<ref>Lowry ''et al.''(1994)</ref> This information was obtained via [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanical records]], which are a reference to how a plant is used by indigenous peoples, not verifiable, scientific or medical evaluation of the effectiveness of these claims. ''Albizia lebbeck'' is also [[psychoactive]].<ref>R\u00e4tsch (2004)</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history of ''A. lebbeck'' is somewhat convoluted. It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Mimosa lebbeck''. [[George Bentham]] placed the [[species]] in its present [[genus]], but other authors believed that the plant described by Linnaeus was the related ''[[Albizia kalkora]]'' as described by Prain (based on the ''Mimosa kalkora'' of [[William Roxburgh]]), and erroneously referred to this species as ''Albizia lebbeck''. However, [[Francisco Manuel Blanco]] used ''Mimosa lebbeck'' to refer to ''[[Albizia retusa]]'' ssp. ''retusa''. In addition, the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is occasionally misspelled ''lebbek''.<ref>USDA (1994), ILDIS (2005)</ref>\n\n[[Junior synonym]]s are:<ref name = ildis />\n* ''Acacia lebbeck'' <small>(L.)

It is not closely related to ''A. lebeck'' however, but a member of the [[Faboideae]], a different legume [[subfamily]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{aut|Ali, S.I.}} (1973): ''Albizia lebbeck'' (L.)
