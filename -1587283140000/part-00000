The station is owned by the [[Hearst Television]] subsidiary of [[Hearst Communications]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]-licensed [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KQCA]] (channel 58). The two stations share studios on Television Circle in [[downtown Sacramento]] and transmitter facilities in [[Walnut Grove, California|Walnut Grove]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 3, 1955. It was founded by the Central Valley Broadcasting Company, a partnership of the Kelly and Hansen families of Sacramento. Central Valley Broadcasting also owned KCRA radio (1320 AM, now [[KIFM (AM)|KIFM]], and 96.1 FM, now [[KYMX]]); the AM station's call letters were intended to be '''KRCA''', but the middle two letters were erroneously transposed by a typist at the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) when that station's original license was drafted in 1945 and was never corrected. By the time KCRA-TV went on the air, the ''KRCA-TV'' call letters had already been taken the previous year by NBC's [[owned-and-operated station]] in [[Los Angeles]] (originally KNBH, now [[KNBC]]). The station's longtime original studios were located at 310 10th Street in Sacramento. KCRA-TV inherited the NBC affiliation from KCCC-TV (channel 40, channel now occupied by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KTXL]]), which became the Sacramento market's first television station when it signed on in September 1953, which had also carried affiliations with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] until other stations debuted in the market. However, it in turn also received the affiliation as a result of KCRA-AM's decade-long affiliation with the [[NBC Red Network]].  KCRA was the third of Sacramento's VHF stations to sign on exactly within a year behind KXTV and KOVR\u2014all signing on in six-month increments.\n\nIn 1959, under the direction of then chief engineer, William Herbert Hartman, construction began on a new {{convert|1,549|ft|m|0|adj=on}} transmission tower near Walnut Grove to transmit the signals of KCRA-TV, KXTV and KOVR; the tower was completed in 1961. Upon the death of KCRA co-founder Ewing C. Kelly in 1960, son Bob Kelly (who was KCRA's station manager, commercial manager and film buyer) became president of KCRA, Inc., while son Jon Kelly (who served as its local sales manager) was named general manager.\n\n[[Image:KCRA Studios.jpg|thumb|150px|left|KCRA/KQCA Studios at 3 Television Circle.]]\nIn January 1962, KCRA-TV began transmitting its signal from the Walnut Grove tower, which became the tallest structure in the state. In April of that year, the FCC approved the sale of the Hansen brothers' 50% share of the KCRA stations to Bob, Jon and their mother Nina Kelly; the company then changed its name to Kelly Broadcasting Company. In September 1968, KCRA-FM's call letters were changed to KCTC. The radio stations were sold to the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] in September 1977, with the sale being finalized in July 1978; KCRA-AM changed its calls to KGNR in August of that year.\n\n[[Image:Kcrachoper.jpg|thumb|150px|right|KCRA's Live Copter 3 at Executive Airport.]]\nIn 1965, the station began using color film for use in its newscasts. A station press release at that time claimed that KCRA was the first station in Sacramento with videotape, the first NBC affiliate with \"network [[color television|color]]\" programming, and the first station to utilize color film, slide and videotape footage. Starting in 1975, it began using remote cameras for live news reports. The station eventually began using [[helicopter]]s and satellite remotes for newsgathering. On September 10, 1966, [[Bob Wilkins (television personality)|Bob Wilkins]] began hosting a Saturday night [[horror film|horror movie]] showcase called ''Seven Arts Theatre''; Wilkins later moved his show to KTXL, and then to [[KTVU]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in the 1970s.\n\n[[File:KCRA Sattelite Truck.PNG|thumb|150px|left|KCRA satellite truck at the 2006 California International Marathon.]]\nIn the mid-1990s, KCRA was carried nationally on the [[PrimeStar]] digital satellite television service as an out-of-market distant local network for customers who lived in a market where a local NBC affiliate was absent or otherwise unavailable with an antenna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202093929/http://www.primestar.com/ezwatch/ezwtch-f.htm|title=Wayback Machine|date=1999-02-02|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> KCRA's national carriage on PrimeStar ended when the satellite service was acquired by DirecTV in September 1999; DirecTV customers were offered Los Angeles NBC station [[KNBC|KNBC-TV]] instead.\n\nLike other local stations, KCRA developed an in-house production facility, with local children's programming, newsmagazines and talk shows. By the beginning of the 21st century, KCRA became the first station in the Sacramento market to broadcast programming in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. Kelly Broadcasting continued to own and operate KCRA-TV until January 1999, when it was purchased by Hearst-Argyle Television (which was renamed [[Hearst Television]] in 2009).<ref>Abate, Tom.

After NBC Weather Plus shut down in November 2008 (following [[NBCUniversal]]'s purchase of [[The Weather Channel]]), the subchannel continued to use the Weather Plus branding as part of the successor NBC Plus automated weather service until late 2008.\n\nOn August 2, 2010, digital subchannel 3.2 was reformatted as \"MoreTV Sacramento,\" a locally programmed channel that featured second-runs of syndicated programs seen locally on KCRA and sister station KQCA; the \"MoreTV\" branding had previously been used by [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] sister station [[WMOR-TV]] and [[KCWE]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] during the early and mid-2000s. The channel ran a mix of [[sitcom]]s (such as ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[That '70s Show]]''), [[drama (film and television)|dramas]] (''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit|Law & Order: SVU]]'') and [[talk show]]s (''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'' and ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]''). It also aired select KCRA newscasts, including rebroadcasts KCRA's 6 p.m. newscast at 7 p.m. and KCRA's 10 p.m. and KQCA's 11 p.m. newscasts at midnight; as well as a simulcast of KCRA's noon newscast.

That show would air on the station for a brief time,{{When|date=January 2013}} but was preempted again due to low ratings\u2014this was the case with CBS station [[KOVR]] (channel 13), which did not run ''[[Guiding Light]]'' due to poor ratings; the latter program had not aired at all in the market since [[KXTV]] (channel 10) dropped it in the early 1990s when it was a CBS affiliate. Given its format as a news-intensive station, KCRA also preempted the [[Weekend Today|weekend edition]] of ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' and the Saturday morning [[T-NBC]] lineup during the 1990s, to run a weekend morning newscast. It also aired a 4:30&nbsp;p.m. newscast, pushing ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''{{'}} start time back a half-hour earlier than the typical practice; that newscast ended after the station began airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''; in September 2002; ''Days'' now airs at the network-recommended 1 p.m. timeslot on weekdays. However, despite NBC's historically low tolerance towards program preemptions, the network has been more than satisfied with KCRA, given its near-total ratings dominance in the Sacramento market.\n\nCurrently, KCRA airs ''[[Today (American TV program)#Today Third Hour|Today Third Hour]]'' on a one-hour [[broadcast delay|delay]] due to ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'' airing in the 9 a.m. timeslot (until 1999, the show aired on KOVR, even back in its days as an ABC station); the [[Today (American TV program)#Today with Hoda and Jenna|fourth hour]] airs after ''[[A Little Late with Lilly Singh]]'' at 2:05&nbsp;a.m. (when NBC rebroadcasts the fourth hour nationally as part of its overnight schedule); sister stations [[KSBW-TV]] in [[Salinas, California]], [[WXII-TV]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]] and [[WYFF]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] also opt to delay the fourth hour of ''Today'' until the overnight hours. Other [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming seen on KCRA includes ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' and its [[Access Hollywood#Access Daily|live counterpart]], ''[[The Kelly Clarkson Show]]'', ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'' and ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]''. The first three are distributed by [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution|NBC's corporate cousin]].\n\nOccasionally as time permits, sister station KQCA may air NBC network programs whenever KCRA is unable to in the event of extended breaking news coverage or scheduled special programming or run KCRA newscasts in their scheduled airtimes due to overruns or scheduled preemptions resulting from [[NBC Sports|network sports coverage]] airing on channel 3.\n\nKCRA carried select [[Sacramento Kings]] games through [[NBA on NBC|the network's broadcast contract with the NBA]] from [[1990\u201391 Sacramento Kings season|1990]] to [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|2002]].\n\n==News operation==\nKCRA presently broadcasts 42\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and 3\u00bd hours on Sundays). KCRA also produces 12\u00bd hours a week of local newscasts for sister station KQCA with a two-hour extension of KCRA's weekday morning newscast from 7\u20139 a.m. and a nightly full-hour prime time broadcast at 10 p.m. The station's longtime slogan, \"Where The News Comes First\", has become a symbol for its news coverage. The slogan was first used by KCRA in December 1958 (Kelly filed to [[trademark]] the slogan in 1980)<ref>United States PTO trademark filing, SN 73216228)</ref> and has been licensed to other television stations.\n\nKCRA has dominated the ratings in Sacramento for most of the time since records have been kept. In the May 2010 sweeps period, KCRA had the highest-rated 11 p.m. newscast but trailed KOVR's 10 p.m. newscast in total households.\n\nHarry Geise was hired by KCRA as its main weatherman in the mid-1960s. While he used information coming out of a weather bureau in [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], [[Maryland]]; his forecasts were accurate enough that almost every farmer in the [[Sacramento Valley]] listened to his forecasts. Through his weathercasts, he taught viewers about weather from \"upper level devils\" to looking out the window. On the scantest of data (weather bureaus, out the window, smell in the air and nut gatherers) but prior to satellite, [[Doppler weather radar]], space weather, home weather stations, and little local information \u2013 Giese could look globally and give weather forecasts as far out as six weeks or six months. By the mid-1970s, KCRA established news bureaus throughout the state, began producing its own [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programming, and initiated a consumer affairs division to answer the needs of concerned consumers.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, KCRA (later to be joined by [[KRON-TV]] and [[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco]]) participated in an experiment in which prime time programming would air one hour earlier (from 7 to 10 p.m., mirroring typical network scheduling in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] and [[Hawaii Time Zone]]s, instead of the standard 8 to 11 p.m. slot for [[Pacific Time Zone]] stations). The \"early prime\" idea led to only a slight decrease in KCRA's ratings, and its 10 p.m. newscast remained the highest-rated late local news program on the West Coast. A station survey showed that 63% of viewers thought a 10 p.m. newscast was a good idea. However, pressure from NBC, who threatened to yank the station's affiliation, forced KCRA to end the practice and revert to the time zone's standard prime time scheduling, announcing its demise a week after KRON-TV discontinued the experiment.<ref>Benson, Jim. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR109588?refcatid=14&printerfriendly=true \"KCRA dumps early prime\"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', August 11, 1993.</ref> [[KOVR]] (channel 13) would itself switch to an early prime time schedule two years later after switching to CBS.\n\nUnder Hearst ownership, KCRA has either hosted or co-hosted many gubernatorial debates within California, often with political reporter Kevin Riggs serving as moderator and one other personality hosting the debate. Many of those debates are simulcasted on sister station [[KSBW]] in [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]. A notable example of such is the debate between [[Meg Whitman]] and [[Jerry Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksbw.com/politics/25203206/detail.html |title=Videos: Watch Brown, Whitman Debate \u2013 Politics News Story \u2013 KSBW The Central Coast |publisher=[[KSBW]] |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLike many stations that have long dominated their markets, KCRA has tended to take an \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" approach to its news product. From about 1960 until the late 1980s, its logo was an Arabic numeral 3 inside a green square with rounded corners and convex sides (to represent the shape of a TV tube).<ref>Design of KCRA-TV's boxed \"3\" logo is credited to Bob Miller, the station's first art director. Jessica Goldman, \"A Passion for the Past: This Artist Paints Pictures of Sacramento's Bygone Landmarks,\" ''Inside East Sacramento'' newspaper, July 2008 edition, p. 70.</ref>  The current logo, a partially modified version of the original design, was adopted in the late 1980s. Also, it referred to its newscasts as ''Channel 3 Reports'' rather than ''Channel 3 News''. The branding was slightly modified after the Hearst purchase to ''KCRA 3 Reports'', even as its newscasts on KQCA began to be titled as ''KCRA 3 News''. However, in August 2009, KCRA retitled its 11 p.m. newscast as the ''KCRA 3 Night Team.'' In July 2011, the ''Reports'' branding was phased out from the station's news branding, which changed to ''KCRA 3 News''.\n\nIn late December 2005, KCRA began using a new \"Triple Doppler\" system for weather reports. In addition to KCRA's own [[Doppler weather radar]] system at Walnut Grove, range and accuracy were increased by adding data from [[NEXRAD]] sites operated by the [[National Weather Service]] located north of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] on [[Virginia Peak (Nevada)|Virginia Peak]], south of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] on [[Mount Umunhum]], and at [[Beale Air Force Base]].\n\nOn February 12, 2007, KCRA became the first television station in the Sacramento market and the first among Hearst-Argyle's station portfolio to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high-definition]] (with the exception of its noon newscast until 2008 as it was still broadcasting in [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] at Arden Fair Mall); this came with the introduction of a new news set designed by FX Group and upgrades to its news helicopter, LiveCopter 3. Upon the conversion to HD, the KCRA logo was modified to include the NBC peacock logo and an \"HD\" lettering. Only in-studio cameras record in HD, while the helicopter's camera, field cameras and other station camera feeds are in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and are upconverted to a [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] format in the control room. In September 2008, KCRA began using a new \"Triple Doppler\" system with high-definition graphics. As of August 25, 2010, with KSBW upgrading its newscasts to HD, both KCRA and KSBW now share resources in this format when covering news stories from their respective markets.\n\nOn December 21, 2015, KCRA announced the addition of a new 4 p.m. newscast, anchored by Lisa Gonzales and Brian Heap. The newscast premiered on January 25, 2016.<ref name=4pm>{{cite news|title=KCRA 3 News to launch weekday 4 p.m. newscast|url=http://m.kcra.com/news/kcra-3-news-to-launch-weekday-4-pm-newscast/37068404|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=KCRA-TV|publisher=Hearst Television|date=December 21, 2015}}</ref> A [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]]-subtitled simulcast of KCRA's 5 p.m. newscast was added to sister station [[KQCA]]'s [[Estrella TV]] subchannel on September 5, 2017.

Central Valley Broadcasting also owned KCRA radio (1320 AM, now [[KIFM (AM)|KIFM]], and 96.1 FM, now [[KYMX]]); the AM station's call letters were intended to be '''KRCA''', but the middle two letters were erroneously transposed by a typist at the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) when that station's original license was drafted in 1945 and was never corrected. By the time KCRA-TV went on the air, the ''KRCA-TV'' call letters had already been taken the previous year by NBC's [[owned-and-operated station]] in [[Los Angeles]] (originally KNBH, now [[KNBC]]). The station's longtime original studios were located at 310 10th Street in Sacramento. KCRA-TV inherited the NBC affiliation from KCCC-TV (channel 40, channel now occupied by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KTXL]]), which became the Sacramento market's first television station when it signed on in September 1953, which had also carried affiliations with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] until other stations debuted in the market. However, it in turn also received the affiliation as a result of KCRA-AM's decade-long affiliation with the [[NBC Red Network]].  KCRA was the third of Sacramento's VHF stations to sign on exactly within a year behind KXTV and KOVR\u2014all signing on in six-month increments.\n\nIn 1959, under the direction of then chief engineer, William Herbert Hartman, construction began on a new {{convert|1,549|ft|m|0|adj=on}} transmission tower near Walnut Grove to transmit the signals of KCRA-TV, KXTV and KOVR; the tower was completed in 1961. Upon the death of KCRA co-founder Ewing C. Kelly in 1960, son Bob Kelly (who was KCRA's station manager, commercial manager and film buyer) became president of KCRA, Inc., while son Jon Kelly (who served as its local sales manager) was named general manager.\n\n[[Image:KCRA Studios.jpg|thumb|150px|left|KCRA/KQCA Studios at 3 Television Circle.]]\nIn January 1962, KCRA-TV began transmitting its signal from the Walnut Grove tower, which became the tallest structure in the state. In April of that year, the FCC approved the sale of the Hansen brothers' 50% share of the KCRA stations to Bob, Jon and their mother Nina Kelly; the company then changed its name to Kelly Broadcasting Company. In September 1968, KCRA-FM's call letters were changed to KCTC. The radio stations were sold to the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] in September 1977, with the sale being finalized in July 1978; KCRA-AM changed its calls to KGNR in August of that year.\n\n[[Image:Kcrachoper.jpg|thumb|150px|right|KCRA's Live Copter 3 at Executive Airport.]]\nIn 1965, the station began using color film for use in its newscasts. A station press release at that time claimed that KCRA was the first station in Sacramento with videotape, the first NBC affiliate with \"network [[color television|color]]\" programming, and the first station to utilize color film, slide and videotape footage. Starting in 1975, it began using remote cameras for live news reports. The station eventually began using [[helicopter]]s and satellite remotes for newsgathering. On September 10, 1966, [[Bob Wilkins (television personality)|Bob Wilkins]] began hosting a Saturday night [[horror film|horror movie]] showcase called ''Seven Arts Theatre''; Wilkins later moved his show to KTXL, and then to [[KTVU]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in the 1970s.\n\n[[File:KCRA Sattelite Truck.PNG|thumb|150px|left|KCRA satellite truck at the 2006 California International Marathon.]]\nLike other local stations, KCRA developed an in-house production facility, with local children's programming, newsmagazines and talk shows. By the beginning of the 21st century, KCRA became the first station in the Sacramento market to broadcast programming in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. Kelly Broadcasting continued to own and operate KCRA-TV until January 1999, when it was purchased by Hearst-Argyle Television (which was renamed [[Hearst Television]] in 2009).<ref>Abate, Tom.

After NBC Weather Plus shut down in November 2008 (following [[NBCUniversal]]'s purchase of [[The Weather Channel]]), the subchannel continued to use the Weather Plus branding as part of the successor NBC Plus automated weather service until late 2008.\n\nOn August 2, 2010, digital subchannel 3.2 was reformatted as \"MoreTV Sacramento,\" a locally programmed channel that featured second-runs of syndicated programs seen locally on KCRA and sister station KQCA; the \"MoreTV\" branding had previously been used by [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] sister station [[WMOR-TV]] and [[KCWE]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] during the early and mid-2000s. The channel ran a mix of [[sitcom]]s (such as ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[That '70s Show]]''), [[drama (film and television)|dramas]] (''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit|Law & Order: SVU]]'') and [[talk show]]s (''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'' and ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]''). It also aired select KCRA newscasts, including rebroadcasts KCRA's 6 p.m. newscast at 7 p.m. and KCRA's 10 p.m. and KQCA's 11 p.m. newscasts at midnight; as well as a simulcast of KCRA's noon newscast.

That show would air on the station for a brief time,{{When|date=January 2013}} but was preempted again due to low ratings\u2014this was the case with CBS station [[KOVR]] (channel 13), which did not run ''[[Guiding Light]]'' due to poor ratings; the latter program had not aired at all in the market since [[KXTV]] (channel 10) dropped it in the early 1990s when it was a CBS affiliate. Given its format as a news-intensive station, KCRA also preempted the [[Weekend Today|weekend edition]] of ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' and the Saturday morning [[T-NBC]] lineup during the 1990s, to run a weekend morning newscast. It also aired a 4:30&nbsp;p.m. newscast, pushing ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''{{'}} start time back a half-hour earlier than the typical practice; that newscast ended after the station began airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''; in September 2002; ''Days'' now airs at the network-recommended 1 p.m. timeslot on weekdays. However, despite NBC's historically low tolerance towards program preemptions, the network has been more than satisfied with KCRA, given its near-total ratings dominance in the Sacramento market.\n\nCurrently, KCRA airs ''[[Today (American TV program)#Today Third Hour|Today Third Hour]]'' on a one-hour [[broadcast delay|delay]] due to ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'' airing in the 9 a.m. timeslot (until 1999, the show aired on KOVR, even back in its days as an ABC station); the [[Today (American TV program)#Today with Hoda and Jenna|fourth hour]] airs after ''[[A Little Late with Lilly Singh]]'' at 2:05&nbsp;a.m. (when NBC rebroadcasts the fourth hour nationally as part of its overnight schedule); sister stations [[KSBW-TV]] in [[Salinas, California]], [[WXII-TV]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]] and [[WYFF]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] also opt to delay the fourth hour of ''Today'' until the overnight hours. Other [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming seen on KCRA includes ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' and its [[Access Hollywood#Access Daily|live counterpart]], ''[[The Kelly Clarkson Show]]'', ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'' and ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]''. The first three are distributed by [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution|NBC's corporate cousin]].\n\nOccasionally as time permits, sister station KQCA may air NBC network programs whenever KCRA is unable to in the event of extended breaking news coverage or scheduled special programming or run KCRA newscasts in their scheduled airtimes due to overruns or scheduled preemptions resulting from [[NBC Sports|network sports coverage]] airing on channel 3.\n\nKCRA carried select [[Sacramento Kings]] games through [[NBA on NBC|the network's broadcast contract with the NBA]] from [[1990\u201391 Sacramento Kings season|1990]] to [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|2002]].\n\n==News operation==\nKCRA presently broadcasts 42\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and 3\u00bd hours on Sundays). KCRA also produces 12\u00bd hours a week of local newscasts for sister station KQCA with a two-hour extension of KCRA's weekday morning newscast from 7\u20139 a.m. and a nightly full-hour prime time broadcast at 10 p.m. The station's longtime slogan, \"Where The News Comes First\", has become a symbol for its news coverage. The slogan was first used by KCRA in December 1958 (Kelly filed to [[trademark]] the slogan in 1980)<ref>United States PTO trademark filing, SN 73216228)</ref> and has been licensed to other television stations.\n\nKCRA has dominated the ratings in Sacramento for most of the time since records have been kept. In the May 2010 sweeps period, KCRA had the highest-rated 11 p.m. newscast but trailed KOVR's 10 p.m. newscast in total households.\n\nHarry Geise was hired by KCRA as its main weatherman in the mid-1960s. While he used information coming out of a weather bureau in [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], [[Maryland]]; his forecasts were accurate enough that almost every farmer in the [[Sacramento Valley]] listened to his forecasts. Through his weathercasts, he taught viewers about weather from \"upper level devils\" to looking out the window. On the scantest of data (weather bureaus, out the window, smell in the air and nut gatherers) but prior to satellite, [[Doppler weather radar]], space weather, home weather stations, and little local information \u2013 Giese could look globally and give weather forecasts as far out as six weeks or six months. By the mid-1970s, KCRA established news bureaus throughout the state, began producing its own [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programming, and initiated a consumer affairs division to answer the needs of concerned consumers.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, KCRA (later to be joined by [[KRON-TV]] and [[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco]]) participated in an experiment in which prime time programming would air one hour earlier (from 7 to 10 p.m., mirroring typical network scheduling in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] and [[Hawaii Time Zone]]s, instead of the standard 8 to 11 p.m. slot for [[Pacific Time Zone]] stations). The \"early prime\" idea led to only a slight decrease in KCRA's ratings, and its 10 p.m. newscast remained the highest-rated late local news program on the West Coast. A station survey showed that 63% of viewers thought a 10 p.m. newscast was a good idea. However, pressure from NBC, who threatened to yank the station's affiliation, forced KCRA to end the practice and revert to the time zone's standard prime time scheduling, announcing its demise a week after KRON-TV discontinued the experiment.<ref>Benson, Jim. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR109588?refcatid=14&printerfriendly=true \"KCRA dumps early prime\"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', August 11, 1993.</ref> [[KOVR]] (channel 13) would itself switch to an early prime time schedule two years later after switching to CBS.\n\nUnder Hearst ownership, KCRA has either hosted or co-hosted many gubernatorial debates within California, often with political reporter Kevin Riggs serving as moderator and one other personality hosting the debate. Many of those debates are simulcasted on sister station [[KSBW]] in [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]. A notable example of such is the debate between [[Meg Whitman]] and [[Jerry Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksbw.com/politics/25203206/detail.html |title=Videos: Watch Brown, Whitman Debate \u2013 Politics News Story \u2013 KSBW The Central Coast |publisher=[[KSBW]] |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLike many stations that have long dominated their markets, KCRA has tended to take an \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" approach to its news product. From about 1960 until the late 1980s, its logo was an Arabic numeral 3 inside a green square with rounded corners and convex sides (to represent the shape of a TV tube).<ref>Design of KCRA-TV's boxed \"3\" logo is credited to Bob Miller, the station's first art director. Jessica Goldman, \"A Passion for the Past: This Artist Paints Pictures of Sacramento's Bygone Landmarks,\" ''Inside East Sacramento'' newspaper, July 2008 edition, p. 70.</ref>  The current logo, a partially modified version of the original design, was adopted in the late 1980s. Also, it referred to its newscasts as ''Channel 3 Reports'' rather than ''Channel 3 News''. The branding was slightly modified after the Hearst purchase to ''KCRA 3 Reports'', even as its newscasts on KQCA began to be titled as ''KCRA 3 News''. However, in August 2009, KCRA retitled its 11 p.m. newscast as the ''KCRA 3 Night Team.'' In July 2011, the ''Reports'' branding was phased out from the station's news branding, which changed to ''KCRA 3 News''.\n\nIn late December 2005, KCRA began using a new \"Triple Doppler\" system for weather reports. In addition to KCRA's own [[Doppler weather radar]] system at Walnut Grove, range and accuracy were increased by adding data from [[NEXRAD]] sites operated by the [[National Weather Service]] located north of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] on [[Virginia Peak (Nevada)|Virginia Peak]], south of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] on [[Mount Umunhum]], and at [[Beale Air Force Base]].\n\nOn February 12, 2007, KCRA became the first television station in the Sacramento market and the first among Hearst-Argyle's station portfolio to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high-definition]] (with the exception of its noon newscast until 2008 as it was still broadcasting in [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] at Arden Fair Mall); this came with the introduction of a new news set designed by FX Group and upgrades to its news helicopter, LiveCopter 3. Upon the conversion to HD, the KCRA logo was modified to include the NBC peacock logo and an \"HD\" lettering. Only in-studio cameras record in HD, while the helicopter's camera, field cameras and other station camera feeds are in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and are upconverted to a [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] format in the control room. In September 2008, KCRA began using a new \"Triple Doppler\" system with high-definition graphics. As of August 25, 2010, with KSBW upgrading its newscasts to HD, both KCRA and KSBW now share resources in this format when covering news stories from their respective markets.\n\nOn December 21, 2015, KCRA announced the addition of a new 4 p.m. newscast, anchored by Lisa Gonzales and Brian Heap. The newscast premiered on January 25, 2016.<ref name=4pm>{{cite news|title=KCRA 3 News to launch weekday 4 p.m. newscast|url=http://m.kcra.com/news/kcra-3-news-to-launch-weekday-4-pm-newscast/37068404|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=KCRA-TV|publisher=Hearst Television|date=December 21, 2015}}</ref> A [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish]]-subtitled simulcast of KCRA's 5 p.m. newscast was added to sister station [[KQCA]]'s [[Estrella TV]] subchannel on September 5, 2017.

He competed in [[Formula One]] between [[1993 Formula One season|1993]] and [[2002 Formula One season|2002]], and finished runner-up in the [[1999 Formula One season|1999]] World Drivers' Championship, driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari]].\n\nHe began his career at the age of seventeen when he entered the [[Formula Ford]] Championship, achieving early success, before progressing to the [[Formula Three]] and [[Formula 3000]] Championships. He made his Formula One debut in 1993 with [[Jordan Grand Prix]], where he achieved early notoriety for his involvement in incidents on and off the track. He scored his first podium in {{F1|1995}} with Jordan, before moving to Ferrari in {{F1|1996}}. His most successful season was in 1999 when he took four victories and challenged [[McLaren]] driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] for the World Championship. He moved to [[Jaguar Racing]] in {{F1|2000}}, scoring the team's first podium in {{F1|2001}} and his final podium in 2002. Irvine retired from competitive motorsport at the end of the 2002 season.\n\nSince retiring, Irvine became a media personality in Great Britain. He was linked with the takeover of the Jordan and [[Minardi]] Formula One teams in 2005, but talks came to nothing. Irvine also expanded his interests in the property market, having built up an investment portfolio during his racing career.\n\n==Early life and career==\nIrvine was born on 10 November 1965 in [[Newtownards]], [[County Down]] in Northern Ireland, to Edmund Sr. and Kathleen.

He competed in [[Formula One]] between [[1993 Formula One season|1993]] and [[2002 Formula One season|2002]], and finished runner-up in the [[1999 Formula One season|1999]] World Drivers' Championship, driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari]].\n\nHe began his career at the age of seventeen when he entered the [[Formula Ford]] Championship, achieving early success, before progressing to the [[Formula Three]] and [[Formula 3000]] Championships. He made his Formula One debut in 1993 with [[Jordan Grand Prix]], where he achieved early notoriety for his involvement in incidents on and off the track. He scored his first podium in {{F1|1995}} with Jordan, before moving to Ferrari in {{F1|1996}}. His most successful season was in 1999 when he took four victories and challenged [[McLaren]] driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] for the World Championship. He moved to [[Jaguar Racing]] in {{F1|2000}}, scoring the team's first podium in {{F1|2001}} and his final podium in 2002. Irvine retired from competitive motorsport at the end of the 2002 season.\n\nSince retiring, Irvine became a media personality in Great Britain. He was linked with the takeover of the Jordan and [[Minardi]] Formula One teams in 2005, but talks came to nothing. Irvine also expanded his interests in the property market, having built up an investment portfolio during his racing career.\n\n==Early life and career==\nIrvine was born on 10 November 1965 in [[Newtownards]], [[County Down]] in Northern Ireland, to Edmund Sr. and Kathleen. He grew up in the village of [[Conlig]] and was educated at [[Regent House Grammar School]] in Newtownards. He has one older sister, Sonia, who acted as Irvine's physiotherapist until 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Irvine's sister Sonia resigns. |url=http://www.eddieirvine.co.uk/news/news9.htm |publisher=eddieirvine.co.uk |date=16 December 1999 |accessdate=5 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208160315/http://www.eddieirvine.co.uk/news/news9.htm |archivedate=8 December 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Irvine's first taste of motorsport came when his family spent their holidays attending the [[British Grand Prix]].

The facility opened in 1928 and was originally named '''Meade Field''', in honor of John E. \"Jack\" Meade, an alumnus and local politician, said to have attended every home football and basketball game until his death in 1972.<ref name=GoRhody/> The facility adopted it current name in 1978, when an aluminum and steel grandstand was added.<ref name=GoRhody>{{cite web |url=https://www.gorhody.com/information/facilities/meade_stadium |title=Meade Stadium |website=gorhody.com |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium has undergone many changes in its history.  The old field house was built in 1933, and in 1934, the west stands and press box were opened, with a capacity of 1,500.  In 1978, the 50-row steel grandstand was erected on the east side, bringing the total capacity up to 8,000.
