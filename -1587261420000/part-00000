She married Marco Arese Lucini, sixth count of Barlassina of the [[House of Arese|Arese family]], son of Benedetto Arese Lucini and Margherita Lucini of the Marquis of Besate, on the 20th of February 1798 in the church of [[Santa Maria alla Porta, Milan|Santa Maria alla Porta]]. They had five children, three which survived: Margherita (1798-1828), Costanza (1803-1822) and [[Francesco Benedetto Arese Lucini|Francesco]] (1805-1881).\n\nAntonietta was one of the most notable figures of Milanese society in the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic era]]. Friends with the Queen of the Netherlands, Ortensia Beauharnais, whose son became [[Napoleon III|Napoleone III]], she was active in the court of Ortensia brother [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], Viceroy of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. Fluent in French, English, and German, she translated ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] into Italian and helped [[Ugo Foscolo]] with his revisions of [[The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis|''The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis'']] (1802).\n\n== Relationship with Ugo Foscolo ==\nHer relationship with Foscolo likely began in July of 1801. The poet dedicated his ode ''All'amica risanata'' ('To the healed friend') to her, stating \"Oh how beautiful you were that evening! How many times I retracted my eyes full of fear! Yes, my fantasy and my heart began to create of you a divinity,\" (\"''E com'eri tu bella questa sera! Quante volte ho ritirati i miei occhi pieni di spavento!

Returning the letters to Foscolo after their relations had ended, the poet entrusted them to [[Silvio Pellico]]. After his arrest the letters passed through various hands, including the Italo-Greek writer Emilio De Tipaldo.

Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New

Jamison criticized Facebook for not being \u201cclear and candid with its users\u201d because the users were not aware of the extent that their data would be used.

Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New
