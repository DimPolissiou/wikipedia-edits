Created by [[Justin Roiland]] and [[Dan Harmon]], Sanchez is a [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[alcoholic]] scientist inspired by [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] from ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]''. Known for his reckless, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] behavior and  [[pessimism|pessimistic]] personality, the character has been well received. He is a [[sociopathic]] [[mad scientist]] who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming himself to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been wrong.\n\nHe is formally referred to as Richard Sanchez C-137 by [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Alternate-universe versions of the main characters|the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]], in reference to his original universe, \"C-137\". Both Richard and Mortimer are voiced by Roiland. Volume 1 of the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty'' comic series]] follows the Richard and Mortimer of Dimension C-132 while most episodes of subsequent installments follow the Rick and Morty of \"C-137\"; the video game ''Pocket Mortys'' follows the Rick and Morty of C-123.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whalen|first1=Andrew|title='Pocket Mortys' Is Out Now, But It's Not Rick and Morty From The Show|url=http://www.player.one/pocket-mortys-out-now-its-not-rick-and-morty-show-503621|website=Player One|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\n{{in-universe|date=December 2019}}\nRick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137 is the father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of [[Morty Smith]] and Summer Smith. He is said to have been away from the family for several years prior to the events of the show. He frequently travels on adventures through space and other planets and dimensions with his grandson Morty. In the third season of the show, it is revealed that he is 70 years old.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://foxgist.com/2017/08/29/rick-and-morty-season-3-episode-6-review-toxin-toxic-toxicity/ |title=Rick And Morty Season 3 Episode 6 Review: Toxin Toxic Toxicity |last=Edim |first=Odiso  |date=29 August 2017 |website=FoxGist |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710141411/https://foxgist.com/2017/08/29/rick-and-morty-season-3-episode-6-review-toxin-toxic-toxicity/ |archive-date=10 Jul 2018}}</ref> Rick is portrayed as a [[mad scientist]]; utilizing his mathematical and scientific prowess in conjunction with apathy and egotistical cynicism, he emerges safely from any situation, regardless of the consequences of his self-preservation. Rick also, in some episodes, desperately tries to regain his family after losing their trust. The creators wanted him to look like he was in control strategically, but not at all when it came to personal matters.\n\nIn \"[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]\", Rick reveals that he powers his flying car with a battery that contains a miniature universe, or microverse, whose inhabitants unknowingly provide the required electricity. In the episode, the inhabitants cease to provide Rick's car with energy. This is because a scientist from the microverse, resembling Rick in many ways, has created his own miniature universe to supply energy for the beings of his universe. Rick destroys the miniature universe inside his own miniature universe, killing everyone inside. He does not demonstrate remorse for his actions, and instead shows satisfaction. Nearing the end of the episode, Rick knows that his own microverse would power his battery, or he would toss them out and create a new one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=364&t=20185|title=02x06 - The Ricks Must Be Crazy - Rick and Morty Transcripts - Forever Dreaming|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRick's intelligence is portrayed to transcend that of metaphysical beings, as demonstrated in the episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 1)#Episodes|Something Ricked This Way Comes]]\", where he outsmarts [[Satan]].\n\nRick reveals his disdain for love in the episode \"[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]\", in which he claims that it is \"a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed\".<ref name=odysseyquotes>{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rick-and-morty-top-10|title=Top 10 Rick And Morty Quotes|author=Dominick LaGrotta|date=25 January 2016|website=[[Odyssey (publication)|The Odyssey Online]]|access-date=19 June 2017}}</ref> When Rick and Morty irreversibly mutate all humans on Earth except for their family members, they abandon their original [[dimension]], Dimension C-137 (and their family in that dimension), for [[Multiverse|a new one]]. Rick locates a universe in which the alternate version of himself has undone the damage inflicted by the love potion, but where the new dimension's Rick and Morty have been killed, allowing the C-137 Rick and Morty to take their place. Despite Morty's trauma concerning this knowledge, Rick is nonchalant about moving to the new dimension.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]\", after numerous Ricks in alternate dimensions are murdered, the [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Other versions of the main characters|Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]] accuses Rick C-137 and orders for him to be arrested. Rick C-137 finds himself captured by an [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Other versions of the main characters|\"evil\" Rick]], but is saved by a legion of alternate-dimension Mortys led by Morty C-137.\n\nIn the first episode of the [[Rick and Morty (season 2)|second season]], \"[[A Rickle in Time]]\", Rick nearly sacrifices himself to save Morty but saves his own life when he realizes that doing so is possible. In the episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 2)#Episodes|Get Schwifty]]\", it is revealed that Rick was once in a [[Rock music|rock]] band called the Flesh Curtains, alongside [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Birdperson]] and [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Squanchy]]. In the episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 2)#Episodes|Big Trouble in Little Sanchez]]\", Rick [[Mind uploading|transfers his consciousness]] into a younger [[Human cloning|clone]] of himself, whom he calls \"Tiny Rick\". He soon becomes anguished in his new body, and manages to return to his older true form, and murders a line of other clones he produced. In the second season's finale, \"[[The Wedding Squanchers]]\", Rick and his family attend Birdperson's wedding, where Birdperson is betrayed and killed by his bride Tammy, a double agent for the Galactic Federation. The family is forced to inhabit an unusually small yet Earth-like planet, as they cannot return to Earth due to Rick's status as a wanted criminal. Rick turns himself into the Federation to allow his family to return home, and is incarcerated on a [[Penal colony|prison planet]] under the charges of having committed \"everything\". But in the season three premiere \"The Rickshank Redemption\", by taking out the Council of Ricks while saving Morty and Summer, it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in to access the Federation's supercomputer and wipe it out financially. Rick also indirectly convinces Beth to divorce Jerry for trying to convince the family to sell him out.\n\nThe premiere episode of the series' third season, \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" shows a possible origin for Rick, in which he was a well-meaning scientist who loved his wife Diane and daughter Beth, but had an encounter with a member of the Council of Ricks during his initial testing of a prototype portal gun, who offered him the secret to creating his inter-dimensional portal gun and joining the Council of Ricks. Shortly after his refusal, and his pledge to quit science forever, a bomb was sent through a portal, killing Diane and Beth. Rick claims that this was a fake memory he created in order to trick his interrogator into implanting a virus into the mind-reading device he was attached to, allowing him to hijack his body and escape from the Federation prison. At the end of the episode, Rick again insists, in a rant to Morty, that the death of his wife and daughter was a fake memory, though this may be simply him denying the truth to hide his feelings.\n\nRick's [[catchphrase]] is \"Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub\", first introduced in the episode \"[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]\". In Birdperson's native language, the catchphrase translates to \"I am in great pain. Please help me\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisecrack.co/shows/wisecrackedition/the-philosophy-of-rick-and-morty/|title=The Philosophy of Rick and Morty|location=Wisecrack|author=Alec Opperman|date=19 December 2015|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/rick-and-morty-recap-ricksy-business-1563309267|title=Rick and Morty Recap - \"Ricksy Business\"|location=Observation Deck|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=15 April 2014|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personality== \nRick is a grumpy, sociopathic, emotionally unstable, bad-tempered, dismissive, narcissistic, cynical, self-centered, destructive, incredibly intelligent, alcoholic, self loathing, rude and crude [[mad scientist]] who often drags his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, and sometimes other members of his family on dangerous adventures. His intelligence makes him believe that existence is miserable and pointless, largely due to his knowledge of infinite universes and timelines with endless possibilities. However, he has been proven to be wrong on several occasions, even by his more naive grandson. While he has shown signs of loving his family and caring deeply about his best friend Birdperson, he has also been shown to be very self-centered, emotionally unstable and willing to threaten, harm, or kill on a whim to get his own way. He isn't afraid to speak his mind and voice harsh opinions of the things about his family that irritate him. His huge ego and reckless, ethically questionable behaviour often lead to him making enemies and getting himself and his family in trouble. Rick is frequently depicted with drool on his mouth and burping while he talks, as a result of his alcoholism.\n\nIn the pilot, Rick is revealed to be an [[Atheism|atheist]], as he tells Summer that \"there is no God.\"<ref name=\"Handlen Pilot\">{{cite web|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title=Rick And Morty: \"Pilot\"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/rick-and-morty-201108|website=The A.V.

Created by [[Justin Roiland]] and [[Dan Harmon]], Sanchez is a [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[alcoholic]] scientist inspired by [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] from ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]''. Known for his reckless, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] behavior and  [[pessimism|pessimistic]] personality, the character has been well received. He is a [[sociopathic]] [[mad scientist]] who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming himself to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been wrong.\n\nHe is formally referred to as Rick Sanchez C-137 by [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Alternate-universe versions of the main characters|the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]], in reference to his original universe, \"C-137\". Both Rick and Morty are voiced by Roiland. Volume 1 of the [[Rick and Morty#Comics|''Rick and Morty'' comic series]] follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension C-132 while most episodes of subsequent installments follow the Rick and Morty of \"C-137\"; the video game ''Pocket Mortys'' follows the Rick and Morty of C-123.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whalen|first1=Andrew|title='Pocket Mortys' Is Out Now, But It's Not Rick and Morty From The Show|url=http://www.player.one/pocket-mortys-out-now-its-not-rick-and-morty-show-503621|website=Player One|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\n{{in-universe|date=December 2019}}\nRick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137 is the father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of [[Morty Smith]] and Summer Smith. He is said to have been away from the family for several years prior to the events of the show. He frequently travels on adventures through space and other planets and dimensions with his grandson Morty. In the third season of the show, it is revealed that he is 70 years old.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://foxgist.com/2017/08/29/rick-and-morty-season-3-episode-6-review-toxin-toxic-toxicity/ |title=Rick And Morty Season 3 Episode 6 Review: Toxin Toxic Toxicity |last=Edim |first=Odiso  |date=29 August 2017 |website=FoxGist |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710141411/https://foxgist.com/2017/08/29/rick-and-morty-season-3-episode-6-review-toxin-toxic-toxicity/ |archive-date=10 Jul 2018}}</ref> Rick is portrayed as a [[mad scientist]]; utilizing his mathematical and scientific prowess in conjunction with apathy and egotistical cynicism, he emerges safely from any situation, regardless of the consequences of his self-preservation. Rick also, in some episodes, desperately tries to regain his family after losing their trust. The creators wanted him to look like he was in control strategically, but not at all when it came to personal matters.\n\nIn \"[[The Ricks Must Be Crazy]]\", Rick reveals that he powers his flying car with a battery that contains a miniature universe, or microverse, whose inhabitants unknowingly provide the required electricity. In the episode, the inhabitants cease to provide Rick's car with energy. This is because a scientist from the microverse, resembling Rick in many ways, has created his own miniature universe to supply energy for the beings of his universe. Rick destroys the miniature universe inside his own miniature universe, killing everyone inside. He does not demonstrate remorse for his actions, and instead shows satisfaction. Nearing the end of the episode, Rick knows that his own microverse would power his battery, or he would toss them out and create a new one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=364&t=20185|title=02x06 - The Ricks Must Be Crazy - Rick and Morty Transcripts - Forever Dreaming|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRick's intelligence is portrayed to transcend that of metaphysical beings, as demonstrated in the episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 1)#Episodes|Something Ricked This Way Comes]]\", where he outsmarts [[Satan]].\n\nRick reveals his disdain for love in the episode \"[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]\", in which he claims that it is \"a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed\".<ref name=odysseyquotes>{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rick-and-morty-top-10|title=Top 10 Rick And Morty Quotes|author=Dominick LaGrotta|date=25 January 2016|website=[[Odyssey (publication)|The Odyssey Online]]|access-date=19 June 2017}}</ref> When Rick and Morty irreversibly mutate all humans on Earth except for their family members, they abandon their original [[dimension]], Dimension C-137 (and their family in that dimension), for [[Multiverse|a new one]]. Rick locates a universe in which the alternate version of himself has undone the damage inflicted by the love potion, but where the new dimension's Rick and Morty have been killed, allowing the C-137 Rick and Morty to take their place. Despite Morty's trauma concerning this knowledge, Rick is nonchalant about moving to the new dimension.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind]]\", after numerous Ricks in alternate dimensions are murdered, the [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Other versions of the main characters|Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks]] accuses Rick C-137 and orders for him to be arrested. Rick C-137 finds himself captured by an [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Other versions of the main characters|\"evil\" Rick]], but is saved by a legion of alternate-dimension Mortys led by Morty C-137.\n\nIn the first episode of the [[Rick and Morty (season 2)|second season]], \"[[A Rickle in Time]]\", Rick nearly sacrifices himself to save Morty but saves his own life when he realizes that doing so is possible. In the episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 2)#Episodes|Get Schwifty]]\", it is revealed that Rick was once in a [[Rock music|rock]] band called the Flesh Curtains, alongside [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Birdperson]] and [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Associates of Rick|Squanchy]]. In the episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 2)#Episodes|Big Trouble in Little Sanchez]]\", Rick [[Mind uploading|transfers his consciousness]] into a younger [[Human cloning|clone]] of himself, whom he calls \"Tiny Rick\". He soon becomes anguished in his new body, and manages to return to his older true form, and murders a line of other clones he produced. In the second season's finale, \"[[The Wedding Squanchers]]\", Rick and his family attend Birdperson's wedding, where Birdperson is betrayed and killed by his bride Tammy, a double agent for the Galactic Federation. The family is forced to inhabit an unusually small yet Earth-like planet, as they cannot return to Earth due to Rick's status as a wanted criminal. Rick turns himself into the Federation to allow his family to return home, and is incarcerated on a [[Penal colony|prison planet]] under the charges of having committed \"everything\". But in the season three premiere \"The Rickshank Redemption\", by taking out the Council of Ricks while saving Morty and Summer, it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in to access the Federation's supercomputer and wipe it out financially. Rick also indirectly convinces Beth to divorce Jerry for trying to convince the family to sell him out.\n\nThe premiere episode of the series' third season, \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" shows a possible origin for Rick, in which he was a well-meaning scientist who loved his wife Diane and daughter Beth, but had an encounter with a member of the Council of Ricks during his initial testing of a prototype portal gun, who offered him the secret to creating his inter-dimensional portal gun and joining the Council of Ricks. Shortly after his refusal, and his pledge to quit science forever, a bomb was sent through a portal, killing Diane and Beth. Rick claims that this was a fake memory he created in order to trick his interrogator into implanting a virus into the mind-reading device he was attached to, allowing him to hijack his body and escape from the Federation prison. At the end of the episode, Rick again insists, in a rant to Morty, that the death of his wife and daughter was a fake memory, though this may be simply him denying the truth to hide his feelings.\n\nRick's [[catchphrase]] is \"Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub\", first introduced in the episode \"[[Meeseeks and Destroy]]\". In Birdperson's native language, the catchphrase translates to \"I am in great pain. Please help me\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisecrack.co/shows/wisecrackedition/the-philosophy-of-rick-and-morty/|title=The Philosophy of Rick and Morty|location=Wisecrack|author=Alec Opperman|date=19 December 2015|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/rick-and-morty-recap-ricksy-business-1563309267|title=Rick and Morty Recap - \"Ricksy Business\"|location=Observation Deck|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=15 April 2014|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personality== \nRick is a grumpy, sociopathic, emotionally unstable, bad-tempered, dismissive, narcissistic, cynical, self-centered, destructive, incredibly intelligent, alcoholic, self loathing, rude and crude [[mad scientist]] who often drags his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, and sometimes other members of his family on dangerous adventures. His intelligence makes him believe that existence is miserable and pointless, largely due to his knowledge of infinite universes and timelines with endless possibilities. However, he has been proven to be wrong on several occasions, even by his more naive grandson. While he has shown signs of loving his family and caring deeply about his best friend Birdperson, he has also been shown to be very self-centered, emotionally unstable and willing to threaten, harm, or kill on a whim to get his own way. He isn't afraid to speak his mind and voice harsh opinions of the things about his family that irritate him. His huge ego and reckless, ethically questionable behaviour often lead to him making enemies and getting himself and his family in trouble. Rick is frequently depicted with drool on his mouth and burping while he talks, as a result of his alcoholism.\n\nIn the pilot, Rick is revealed to be an [[Atheism|atheist]], as he tells Summer that \"there is no God.\"<ref name=\"Handlen Pilot\">{{cite web|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title=Rick And Morty: \"Pilot\"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/rick-and-morty-201108|website=The A.V.

He declined to enter a brewery and became involved in [[wool]]len manufacture in [[Burley-in-Wharfedale]], Yorkshire. In 1850 he married Jane Martha, eldest daughter of [[Thomas Arnold|Dr Thomas Arnold]]. She was not a Quaker and Forster was formally [[Excommunication|read out of meeting]] for marrying her, but the Friends who were commissioned to announce the sentence \"shook hands and stayed to luncheon\". Forster thereafter ranked himself as a member of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=675}}\n\nThe Forsters had no natural children, but when Mrs Forster's brother, William Delafield Arnold, died in 1859, leaving four orphans, the Forsters adopted them as their own. One of the children was [[Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster]], a [[Liberal Unionist]] member of parliament, who eventually became a member of [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]]'s cabinet.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=675}} Another was [[Florence Arnold-Forster]], who wrote a journal about family life and politics in the 1880s.<ref>Arnold-Forster, Florence, T W.

In 1846\u201347, he accompanied his father to Ireland as distributor of the Friends' relief fund for the [[\\Great Irish Famine|famine in Connemara]], and the state of the country made a deep impression on him. He began to take an active part in public affairs by speaking and lecturing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=675}}\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1859, Forster stood as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds]], but lost. He was highly esteemed in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]], and in 1861 was returned unopposed for [[Bradford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford]]. He was returned again in 1865 (unopposed) and in 1868 (at the head of the poll). He took a prominent part in parliament in the debates on the [[American Civil War]], and in 1865 was made [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s ministry. It was then that he first became a prominent advocate of [[Imperial Federation|imperial federation]]. In 1866, his attitude on parliamentary reform attracted attention. He  showed knowledge of the real condition of common people, and foreshadowed Radical legislation, heralding the start of a campaign of educational reform.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=675\u2013676}}\n\n[[File:William Edward Forster, Vanity Fair, 1869-03-06.jpg|thumb|left|William Edward Forster caricatured by \"Ape\" in ''Vanity Fair'', 1859]]\nDirectly after the [[Reform Bill]] had passed, Forster and [[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Edward Cardwell]] brought in Education [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] in 1867 and 1868. In 1868, when the Liberal party returned to office, Forster was appointed [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Vice-president of the Council]], with the duty of preparing a government measure for national education.  The [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Elementary Education Bill]] was introduced on 17 February 1870 and [[School board (England & Wales)|school boards]] were set up with elected representatives (for example, [[Charles Reed (British politician)|Charles Reed]] in London) the same year where possible.  The religious difficulty at once came to the front. The [[Manchester Education Union]] and the [[National Education League|National Education League/Birmingham Education League]] had already formulated in the provinces the two opposing theories, the former standing for the preservation of denominational interests, the latter advocating secular rate-aided education as the only means of protecting [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformity]] against the Church.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=676}}\n\nThe [[Dissenters]] were not satisfied with Forster's \"conscience clause\" as contained in the bill, and they regarded him, the ex-Quaker, as a deserter from their own side. They resented the \"25th clause\", permitting school boards to pay the fees of needy children at denominational schools out of the rates, as an insidious attack on their interests. By 14 March, at the second reading, the controversy had assumed threatening proportions; and [[George Dixon (MP)|George Dixon]], the Liberal member for Birmingham and chairman of the National Education League, moved an amendment, the effect of which was to prohibit all religious education in board schools. The government made its rejection a question of confidence, and the amendment was withdrawn; but the result was the insertion of the [[William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple|Cowper-Temple clause]] (which prohibited the use of distinctive religious formularies in a rate-supported school) as a compromise before the bill passed. The bill of 1870, imperfect as it was, established at last some approach to a system of national education in England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=676}}\n\nForster's next important work was in passing the [[Ballot Act 1872]]. In 1874, he was again returned for Bradford. In 1875, when [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] \"retired,\" Forster was strongly supported for the leadership of the Liberal party, but declined to be nominated. In the same year he was elected to the [[Royal Society]], and made Lord Rector of [[university of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]]. In 1876, when the Eastern question was looming, he visited [[Serbia]] and [[Turkey]], and his subsequent speeches on the subject were marked by moderation. On Gladstone's return to office in 1880, he was made [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]. He carried the [[Compensation for Disturbance Bill]] through the Commons, only to see it thrown out in the Lords. On 24 January 1881, he introduced a Coercion Bill in the House of Commons, to deal with the growth of the [[Irish National Land League|Land League]], and in the course of his speech declared it to be \"the most painful duty\" he had ever had to perform. The bill passed, among its provisions being one enabling the Irish government to arrest without trial persons \"reasonably suspected\" of crime and conspiracy.\nThe Irish party used every opportunity to oppose the act, and Forster was kept constantly on the move between [[Dublin]] and London, conducting his campaign and defending it in the House of Commons.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=676}}\n[[File:William Edward Forster by Henry Tanworth Wells.jpg|thumb|upright|William Edward Forster by [[Henry Tanworth Wells]].<ref>National Portrait Gallery, London, accessed September 2009</ref>]]\n\nHe was nicknamed \"[[Buckshot]]\" by the Nationalist press, on the supposition that he had ordered its use by the police when firing on a crowd. On 13 October 1881, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] was arrested, and soon after the [[Land League]] was suppressed. From that time Forster's life was in danger, and he had to be escorted by [[mounted police]] in Dublin. In speeches given across Ireland in early 1882, Forster, while criticizing the populace for not helping the government, nonetheless pledged that it was the government's duty to protect them. The danger to his life became more apparent, and several plans to murder him were frustrated by the merest accidents. On 2 May 1882, Gladstone announced that the government intended to release Parnell and his fellow-prisoners from [[Kilmainham Gaol]], and that both [[Lord Cowper-Temple]] and Forster had in consequence resigned; on the following Saturday, Forster's successor, [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]], was murdered in [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin. Still, Forster offered to return to Dublin temporarily as chief secretary, but the offer was declined. In the ensuing parliamentary session, he charged Parnell with conspiring in the murders, to be in turn denounced by Parnell.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=676}}\n\nDuring the remaining years of his life, Forster's political record covered various interesting subjects, but his efforts in Ireland threw them all into shadow. He was at variance with Gladstone's Liberalism, for example in policies towards [[Sudan]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. When the constituency of Bradford was divided into three, he was returned for the central division but did not take up his seat.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=676}}\n\nForster died on the eve of the

He declined to enter a brewery and became involved in [[wool]]len manufacture in [[Burley-in-Wharfedale]], Yorkshire. In 1850 he married Jane Martha, eldest daughter of [[Thomas Arnold|Dr Thomas Arnold]]. She was not a Quaker and Forster was formally [[Excommunication|read out of meeting]] for marrying her, but the Friends who were commissioned to announce the sentence \"shook hands and stayed to luncheon\". Forster thereafter ranked himself as a member of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=675}}\n\nThe Forsters had no natural children, but when Mrs Forster's brother, William Delafield Arnold, died in 1859, leaving four orphans, the Forsters adopted them as their own. One of the children was [[Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster]], a [[Liberal Unionist]] member of parliament, who eventually became a member of [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]]'s cabinet.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=675}} Another was [[Florence Arnold-Forster]], who wrote a journal about family life and politics in the 1880s.<ref>Arnold-Forster, Florence, T W. Moody, R A. J. Hawkins, and Margaret Moody. ''Florence Arnold-Forster's Irish Journal.''

In 1846\u201347, he accompanied his father to Ireland as distributor of the Friends' relief fund for the [[\\Great Irish Famine|famine in Connemara]], and the state of the country made a deep impression on him. He began to take an active part in public affairs by speaking and lecturing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=675}}\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1859, Forster stood as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds]], but lost. He was highly esteemed in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]], and in 1861 was returned unopposed for [[Bradford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford]]. He was returned again in 1865 (unopposed) and in 1868 (at the head of the poll). He took a prominent part in parliament in the debates on the [[American Civil War]], and in 1865 was made [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s ministry. It was then that he first became a prominent advocate of [[Imperial Federation|imperial federation]]. In 1866, his attitude on parliamentary reform attracted attention. He  showed knowledge of the real condition of common people, and foreshadowed Radical legislation, heralding the start of a campaign of educational reform.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=675\u2013676}}\n\n[[File:William Edward Forster, Vanity Fair, 1869-03-06.jpg|thumb|left|William Edward Forster caricatured by \"Ape\" in ''Vanity Fair'', 1859]]\nDirectly after the [[Reform Bill]] had passed, Forster and [[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Edward Cardwell]] brought in Education [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] in 1867 and 1868. In 1868, when the Liberal party returned to office, Forster was appointed [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Vice-president of the Council]], with the duty of preparing a government measure for national education.  The [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Elementary Education Bill]] was introduced on 17 February 1870 and [[School board (England & Wales)|school boards]] were set up with elected representatives (for example, [[Charles Reed (British politician)|Charles Reed]] in London) the same year where possible.  The religious difficulty at once came to the front. The [[Manchester Education Union]] and the [[National Education League|National Education League/Birmingham Education League]] had already formulated in the provinces the two opposing theories, the former standing for the preservation of denominational interests, the latter advocating secular rate-aided education as the only means of protecting [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformity]] against the Church.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=676}}\n\nThe [[Dissenters]] were not satisfied with Forster's \"conscience clause\" as contained in the bill, and they regarded him, the ex-Quaker, as a deserter from their own side. They resented the \"25th clause\", permitting school boards to pay the fees of needy children at denominational schools out of the rates, as an insidious attack on their interests. By 14 March, at the second reading, the controversy had assumed threatening proportions; and [[George Dixon (MP)|George Dixon]], the Liberal member for Birmingham and chairman of the National Education League, moved an amendment, the effect of which was to prohibit all religious education in board schools.

Apple calls this mode ''HiDPI mode''. In simpler words, it is one logical pixel = four physical pixels at the very beginning. The advantage of this equation is that the CPU \"sees\" a small portion of the data and calculates the relative positions of each element, and the GPU renders these elements with high quality assets to make the output much sharper and clearer. The goal of Retina displays is to make the text and images being displayed extremely crisp, so that pixels are not visible to the naked eye or at viewing distance.<ref name=\"Apple iPhone 4 announcement\">{{cite web|last1=Jobs|first1=Steve|title=Apple iPhone 4 announcement|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__jxoczNWc|website=YouTube|publisher=Apple|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> This allows displays to rival the smooth curves and sharpness of printed text and immediacy of photographic prints.<ref name=\"Serif vs. Sans-Serif Fonts for HD Screens\">{{cite web|last1=Nielsen|first1=Jakob|title=Serif vs. Sans-Serif Fonts for HD Screens|url=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts-hd-screens/|publisher=Nielsen Norman Group|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple iPad 3 press release\">{{cite web|title=Apple iPad 3 press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/07Apple-Launches-New-iPad.html|publisher=Apple|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gruber|first1=John|title=Pixel Perfect|url=http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/pixel_perfect|website=Daring Fireball|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nRetina displays have been gradually released over a number of years, and the term is now used for nearly all of Apple products containing a screen, including the [[Apple Watch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], [[iPad]], [[MacBook (Retina)|MacBook]], [[MacBook Air]], [[Retina MacBook Pro|MacBook Pro]], and [[IMac (Intel-based)#iMac with Retina display|iMac]].<ref name=\"Apple info 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/retina-display.html|title=Apple&nbsp;\u2013 Learn about the Retina display|date=|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> Apple uses slightly different versions of the term for these models, including ''Retina HD display'' for the [[iPhone 6]] and later versions,<ref>{{cite web|title=iPhone 6 - Technical Specifications&nbsp;\u2014 Apple|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/|website=Apple|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> and ''Retina [[4k resolution|4K]]/[[5k resolution|5K]] display'' for the iMac.<ref>{{cite web|title=iMac&nbsp;\u2014 Tech Specs&nbsp;\u2014 Apple|url=https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/|website=Apple|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nApple's Retina displays are not an absolute standard for display sharpness, but vary depending on the size of the display on the device, and at what distance the user would typically be viewing the screen. Where on smaller devices with smaller displays users would view the screen at a closer distance to their eyes, the displays have more PPI (Pixels Per Inch), while on larger devices with larger displays where the user views the screen further away, the screen uses a lower PPI value. Later device versions have had additional improvements, whether an increase in the screen size (the iPhone 6 Plus), contrast ratio (the iPhone 6 Plus, and iMac with Retina 4K/5K display), and/or, more recently, PPI count (iPhone X, XS, XS Max, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max); as a result, Apple uses the names \u201cRetina HD display\", \"Retina 4K/5K display\", \"Super Retina HD display\", \u201cSuper Retina XDR display\u201d, and \"Liquid Retina display\" for each successive version.\n\n==Rationale==\n{{See also|Fovea centralis#Angular size of foveal cones}}\n\nWhen introducing the [[iPhone 4]], [[Steve Jobs]] said the number of pixels needed for a Retina display is about 300&nbsp;PPI for a device held 10 to 12 inches from the eye.<ref name=\"npr info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://m.npr.org/story/127530049|title=NPR Live Blog of iPhone 4 Introduction|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> One way of expressing this as a unit is pixels-per-degree (PPD) which takes into account both the screen resolution and the distance from which the device is viewed. Based on Jobs' predicted number of 300, the threshold for a Retina display starts at the PPD value of 57&nbsp;PPD. 57&nbsp;PPD means that a tall [[skinny triangle]] with a height equal to the viewing distance and a top angle of one degree will have a base on the device's screen that covers 57 pixels. Any display's viewing quality (from phone displays to huge projectors) can be described with this size-independent universal parameter. Note that the PPD parameter is not an intrinsic parameter of the display itself, unlike absolute pixel resolution (e.g. 1920\u00d71080 pixels) or relative pixel density (e.g. 401&nbsp;PPI), but is dependent on the distance between the display and the eye of the person (or lens of the device) viewing the display; moving the eye closer to the display reduces the PPD, and moving away from it increases the PPD in proportion to the distance.\nIt can be calculated by the formula\n:<math> 2 d r \\tan(0.5^\\circ)</math>\nwhere <math>d</math> is the distance to the screen, <math>r</math> is the resolution of the screen in pixels per unit length, and <math>1^\\circ</math> is the aperture of a cone having the apex on focus, height <math>d</math>, and the base in the eye lens &mdash;the optical correspondent to a cone inside the eye having the same base and the apex in the other focus, the fovea.  That aperture, which can be measured by [[visual field test]]s, varies widely among different human subjects.\n\nIn practice, thus far Apple has converted a device's display to Retina by doubling the number of pixels in each direction, quadrupling the total resolution. This increase creates a sharper interface at the same physical dimensions. The sole exception to this has been the iPhone 6 Plus, which renders its display at triple the number of pixels in each direction, before down-sampling to a 1080p resolution.\n\n== Models ==\n\nThe displays are manufactured worldwide by different suppliers.

Apple calls this mode ''HiDPI mode''. In simpler words, it is one logical pixel = four physical pixels at the very beginning. The advantage of this equation is that the CPU \"sees\" a small portion of the data and calculates the relative positions of each element, and the GPU renders these elements with high quality assets to make the output much sharper and clearer.

Where on smaller devices with smaller displays users would view the screen at a closer distance to their eyes, the displays have more PPI (Pixels Per Inch), while on larger devices with larger displays where the user views the screen further away, the screen uses a lower PPI value. Later device versions have had additional improvements, whether an increase in the screen size (the iPhone 6 Plus), contrast ratio (the iPhone 6 Plus, and iMac with Retina 4K/5K display), and/or, more recently, PPI count (iPhone X, XS, XS Max, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max); as a result, Apple uses the names \u201cRetina HD display\", \"Retina 4K/5K display\", \"Super Retina HD display\", \u201cSuper Retina XDR display\u201d, and \"Liquid Retina display\" for each successive version.\n\n==Rationale==\n{{See also|Fovea centralis#Angular size of foveal cones}}\n\nWhen introducing the [[iPhone 4]], [[Steve Jobs]] said the number of pixels needed for a Retina display is about 300&nbsp;PPI for a device held 10 to 12 inches from the eye.<ref name=\"npr info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://m.npr.org/story/127530049|title=NPR Live Blog of iPhone 4 Introduction|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> One way of expressing this as a unit is pixels-per-degree (PPD) which takes into account both the screen resolution and the distance from which the device is viewed. Based on Jobs' predicted number of 300, the threshold for a Retina display starts at the PPD value of 57&nbsp;PPD. 57&nbsp;PPD means that a tall [[skinny triangle]] with a height equal to the viewing distance and a top angle of one degree will have a base on the device's screen that covers 57 pixels. Any display's viewing quality (from phone displays to huge projectors) can be described with this size-independent universal parameter. Note that the PPD parameter is not an intrinsic parameter of the display itself, unlike absolute pixel resolution (e.g. 1920\u00d71080 pixels) or relative pixel density (e.g. 401&nbsp;PPI), but is dependent on the distance between the display and the eye of the person (or lens of the device) viewing the display; moving the eye closer to the display reduces the PPD, and moving away from it increases the PPD in proportion to the distance.\nIt can be calculated by the formula\n:<math> 2 d r \\tan(0.5^\\circ)</math>\nwhere <math>d</math> is the distance to the screen, <math>r</math> is the resolution of the screen in pixels per unit length, and <math>1^\\circ</math> is the aperture of a cone having the apex on focus, height <math>d</math>, and the base in the eye lens &mdash;the optical correspondent to a cone inside the eye having the same base and the apex in the other focus, the fovea.  That aperture, which can be measured by [[visual field test]]s, varies widely among different human subjects.\n\nIn practice, thus far Apple has converted a device's display to Retina by doubling the number of pixels in each direction, quadrupling the total resolution. This increase creates a sharper interface at the same physical dimensions. The sole exception to this has been the iPhone 6 Plus, which renders its display at triple the number of pixels in each direction, before down-sampling to a 1080p resolution.\n\n== Models ==\n\nThe displays are manufactured worldwide by different suppliers.
