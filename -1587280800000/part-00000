It began operations for the first time in Bilbao in 2002 and in Vitoria in 2008. It is one of the four commercial brands under which [[Eusko Trenbideak - Ferrocarriles Vascos|Basque Railways]] operates, as a public company managed by the [[Basque Government]]. The entire network, as the [[Euskotren Trena]] network, uses {{RailGauge|1000mm}} [[Metre gauge#Spain|narrow gauge rail tracks]].\n\nEuskotren Tranbia operates the tram services, while [[Euskotren Trena]] operates the [[commuter rail]] networks, ''Euskotren Autobusa'' the bus services and ''Euskotren Kargo'' the freight rail services. Since 2006 ''Euskotren Tranbia'', formerly known simply as \"Euskotran\", is the commercial brand for operator of the tram network, while the network itself is owned by the public entity Euskal Trenbide Sarea (Basque Railway Network). In 2012 the commercial brand changed from ''Euskotran'' to ''Euskotren Tranbia'' with the word ''tranbia'' being [[Basque language|Basque]] for \"tram\".\n\n== Services ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\n\n[[File:Bilbao 05 2012 EuskoTran 2868.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tram in Bilbao.]]\n\n''Euskotren Tranbia'' operates tram networks in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (province of [[\u00c1lava]]) and [[Bilbao]] (province of [[Biscay]]), plus one being under construction in [[Leioa]] to connect in the future the campus of the [[University of the Basque Country]] with Leioa and then with the [[Urbinaga (Metro Bilbao)|Urbinaga metro station]], in [[Sestao]]. The first network, then named ''EuskoTran'' and later ''Euskotran'' started in [[Bilbao]] in 2002, after two years under construction, connecting the [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station]] with Uribitarte. The line was eventually expanded to the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], the hospital of Basurto and finally La Casilla. The tramway of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] opened in 2008 and has a Y-shaped network, with two different lines that cross the city from south to north.\n\nEuskotran Tranbia runs on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic, dedicated tracks and grass tracks. It also shares dedicated tracks with the local bus services, [[TUVISA]] in Vitoria and [[Bilbobus]] in Bilbao.\n\n=== Stops ===\n\n[[File:Vitoria 05 2012 EuskoTran 1845.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tram unit in Vitoria-Gasteiz.]]\n\nThe tram has its own, distinguishable stops, some of them shared with bus systems and with low platforms. The stops of [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station]], Ribera and Abando, all of them in Bilbao, do not have their own separate stop, they use the sidewalk. Except for Bilbao-Atxuri and Legibitzarra/Parlamento, the second one in the Vitoria network, all stops are unstaffed and rely on automated ticket machines. All the stations have displays and screens with the network map, the current time and temperature and the frequencies. Due the low platforms, the access between them involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than 2 m (6&nbsp;ft 7 in). This allows wheelchairs, prams, pushchairs and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the pavement is integrated with the tram stop. The Bilbao line has 14 stops, while the Vitoria one has 20.\n\n=== Lines and stations ===\n\n[[File:Euskotran logo.gif|thumb|right|250px|The service was formerly branded as ''Euskotran''.]]\n\nThe Euskotren Tranbia networks serves the following stations.\n\n*'''Bilbao, [[Biscay]]'''\n** [[File:Euskotren TR.svg|19px]] [[tram]] line - Atxuri to La Casilla.\n\n*'''[[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], [[\u00c1lava]]'''\n** [[File:Euskotren TR.svg|19px]] T1 [[tram]] line - Ibaiondo to Unibertsitatea.\n** [[File:Euskotren TR.svg|19px]] T2 [[tram]] line - Abetxuko to Florida.\n\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n\n==== Bilbao's Tram ====\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#7CC242; color:black; width: 33%;\"| Bilbao's Tram\n|-\n<!-- Bilbao's Tram -->\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station|Bilbao-Atxuri]] [[File:Madrid-MetroRENFE.svg|10px]]\n* Ribera\n* Arriaga\n* [[Bilbao-Abando]] [[File:Madrid-MetroRENFE.svg|10px]] \n* P\u00edo Baroja\n* Uribitarte\n* Guggenheim\n* Abandoibarra\n* Euskalduna\n* Sabino Arana\n* [[San Mam\u00e9s (Metro Bilbao)|San Mam\u00e9s]] {{rail-interchange|bus}}\n* Ospitalea/Hospital\n* Basurto\n* La Casilla\n|}\n\n| valign=\"top\" |\n\n==== Ibaiondo line (Vitoria's Tram) ====\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#7CC242; color:black; width: 33%;\"| Vitoria's Tram - Ibaiondo line\n|-\n<!-- Ibaiondo line -->\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Angulema\n* Legabitzarra/Parlamento\n* Lovaina\n* Antso Jakituna/Sancho el Sabio\n* Europa \n* Honduras\n* Euskal Herria {{rail-interchange|bus}}\n* Txagorritxu\n* Wellington\n* Lakuabizkarra\n* Landaberde\n* Ibaiondo\n|}\n\n| valign=\"top\" |\n\n==== Abetxuko line (Vitoria's Tram) ====\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"background:silver; color:black; width: 33%;\"| Vitoria's Tram - Abetxuko line\n|-\n<!-- Abetxuko line -->\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Angulema\n* Legabitzarra/Parlamento\n* Lovaina\n* Antso Jakituna/Sancho el Sabio\n* Europa \n* Honduras\n* Intermodal {{rail-interchange|bus}}\n* Forondako Atea/Portal de Foronda\n* Gernikako Arbola\n* Arriaga\n* Artapadura\n* Ka\u00f1abenta\n* Kristo\n* [[Abetxuko]]\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Fares and ticketing ===\n\nBilbao's tram uses both regular paper tickets than can be acquired in the automated machines in every stop; there are single, daily and monthly tickets available.

A major characteristic of his criticism since the start of his career has been a deep interest in iconography. Japanese theatrical criticism had tended before then to be concerned exclusively with actors and acting. Hasebe changed the focus of criticism to incorporate critical interpretation and analysis of visual elements such as set designs, costumes, propose and lighting.\n\n\u00a0The second focus of his work has been biographies of directors and Kabuki actors. His work in this area has been based on a wide variety of sources including formal interviews, private conversations and email communications in addition to bibliographical sources. His methodology brings figures engaged in the world of the theatre vividly to life in his work.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBooks by Hiroshi Hasebe:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://researchmap.jp/read0064287/books_etc|title=\u9577\u8c37\u90e8 \u6d69 - \u66f8\u7c4d\u7b49\u51fa\u7248\u7269 - researchmap|website=researchmap.jp|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n* ''Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Kabuki no tanoshimi'' (Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Enjoying Kabuki), Tokyo: Iwanami Gendai Bunko, 2015 {{ISBN|978-4006022655}}\n* ''Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Odori no tanoshimi'' (Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Enjoying Dance), Tokyo: Iwanami Gendai Bunko, 2015 {{ISBN|978-4000244633}}\n* ''Noda Hideki no engeki'' (The Theatre of Noda Hideki), Tokyo: Kawaide Shob\u014d Shinsha, 2014 {{ISBN|978-4309275499}}\n* ''Tensai to meijin, Nakamura Kanzabur\u014d to Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d'' (Genius and Master, Nakamura Kanzabur\u014d and Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d), Tokyo: Bunshun Shinsho, 2016 {{ISBN|978-4166610662}}\n* ''Kikunosuke no reigi'' (The Propriety of Kikunosuke), Tokyo: Shinch\u014dsha, 2014 {{ISBN|978-4103367512}}\n* ''Kenryoku to kodoku, Enshutsuka Ninagawa Yukio no jidai'' (Power and Solitude, The Age of the Director Ninagawa Yukio), Iwanami Shoten, 2017 {{ISBN| 978-4000611985}}\n* ''Enshutsujutsu'' (The Art of Theatrical Direction), Tokyo: Chikuma Shob\u014d, 2012 {{ISBN|978-4480429469}}\n* ''Kikugor\u014d no iroke'' (The Allure of Kikugor\u014d), Tokyo: Bunshun Shinsho, 2007 {{ISBN|978-4166605743}}\n* ''Noda Hideki ron'' (Noda Hideki), Tokyo: Kawaide Shob\u014d Shinsha, 2005 {{ISBN|978-4309268194}}\n* ''Kizutsuita sei, David Leveaux enshutsu no gih\u014d'' (Wounded Sexuality: The Theatrical Technique of David Leveaux), Tokyo: Kinokuniya Shoten, 1997 {{ISBN|978-4314008082}}\n* ''Nusumareta riaru: 90 nendai engeki wa kataru'' (Stolen reality: Theatre of the 1990s), Tokyo: Asuki, 1998 {{ISBN|978-4757202009}}\n* ''4 by\u014d no kakumei, T\u014dky\u014d no engeki 1982-1992'' (The 4-Second Revolution: The Theatre of Tokyo, 1982-92), Tokyo: Kawaide Shob\u014d Shinsha, 1993 {{ISBN|978-4309261867}}\n\n== Criticism of the work of Hasebe Hiroshi ==\n* Ogawa Setsuko, 'Power and Solitude', Mainichi Shimbun, June 17, 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20170517/ddm/015/040/013000c|title=\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30a6\u30aa\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u300e\u6a29\u529b\u3068\u5b64\u72ec\u300f \u9577\u8c37\u90e8\u6d69\u3055\u3093|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e|language=ja|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n* Watanabe Tamotsu, 'Genius and Master', Mainichi Shimbun, June 22, 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20160522/ddm/015/070/019000c|title=\u4eca\u9031\u306e\u672c\u68da\uff1a\u6e21\u8fba\u4fdd\u30fb\u8a55 \u300e\u5929\u624d\u3068\u540d\u4eba\u2212\u4e2d\u6751\u52d8\u4e09\u90ce\u3068\u5742\u6771\u4e09\u6d25\u4e94\u90ce\u300f\uff1d\u9577\u8c37\u90e8\u6d69\u30fb\u8457|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e|language=ja|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n* Yano Seiichi, 'The Secret of Beauty on the Stage', Shinch\u014dsha, December 1, 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shincho-live.jp/ebook/s/nami/2014/12/201412_13.php|title=\u66f8\u8a55\uff65\u30a8\u30c3\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc {{!}} \u6ce2 -E magazine Nami-\uff5cShincho LIVE!\uff08\u65b0\u6f6e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\uff01\uff09\uff5c \u65b0\u6f6e\u793e\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc|website=www.shincho-live.jp|language=ja|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

A major characteristic of his criticism since the start of his career has been a deep interest in iconography. Japanese theatrical criticism had tended before then to be concerned exclusively with actors and acting. Hasebe changed the focus of criticism to incorporate critical interpretation and analysis of visual elements such as set designs, costumes, propose and lighting.\n\n\u00a0The second focus of his work has been biographies of directors and Kabuki actors. His work in this area has been based on a wide variety of sources including formal interviews, private conversations and email communications in addition to bibliographical sources. His methodology brings figures engaged in the world of the theatre vividly to life in his work.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBooks by Hiroshi Hasebe:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://researchmap.jp/read0064287/books_etc|title=\u9577\u8c37\u90e8 \u6d69 - \u66f8\u7c4d\u7b49\u51fa\u7248\u7269 - researchmap|website=researchmap.jp|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n* ''Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Kabuki no tanoshimi'' (Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Enjoying Kabuki), Tokyo: Iwanami Gendai Bunko, 2015 {{ISBN|978-4006022655}}\n* ''Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Odori no tanoshimi'' (Bando Mitsugor\u014d, Enjoying Dance), Tokyo: Iwanami Gendai Bunko, 2015 {{ISBN|978-4000244633}}\n* ''Noda Hideki no engeki'' (The Theatre of Noda Hideki), Tokyo: Kawaide Shob\u014d Shinsha, 2014 {{ISBN|978-4309275499}}\n* ''Tensai to meijin, Nakamura Kanzabur\u014d to Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d'' (Genius and Master, Nakamura Kanzabur\u014d and Band\u014d Mitsugor\u014d), Tokyo: Bunshun Shinsho, 2016 {{ISBN|978-4166610662}}\n* ''Kikunosuke no reigi'' (The Propriety of Kikunosuke), Tokyo: Shinch\u014dsha, 2014 {{ISBN|978-4103367512}}\n* ''Kenryoku to kodoku, Enshutsuka Ninagawa Yukio no jidai'' (Power and Solitude, The Age of the Director Ninagawa Yukio), Iwanami Shoten, 2017 {{ISBN| 978-4000611985}}\n* ''Enshutsujutsu'' (The Art of Theatrical Direction), Tokyo: Chikuma Shob\u014d, 2012 {{ISBN|978-4480429469}}\n* ''Kikugor\u014d no iroke'' (The Allure of Kikugor\u014d), Tokyo: Bunshun Shinsho, 2007 {{ISBN|978-4166605743}}\n* ''Noda Hideki ron'' (Noda Hideki), Tokyo: Kawaide Shob\u014d Shinsha, 2005 {{ISBN|978-4309268194}}\n* ''Kizutsuita sei, David Leveaux enshutsu no gih\u014d'' (Wounded Sexuality: The Theatrical Technique of David Leveaux), Tokyo: Kinokuniya Shoten, 1997 {{ISBN|978-4314008082}}\n* ''Nusumareta riaru: 90 nendai engeki wa kataru'' (Stolen reality: Theatre of the 1990s), Tokyo: Asuki, 1998 {{ISBN|978-4757202009}}\n* ''4 by\u014d no kakumei, T\u014dky\u014d no engeki 1982-1992'' (The 4-Second Revolution: The Theatre of Tokyo, 1982-92), Tokyo: Kawaide Shob\u014d Shinsha, 1993 {{ISBN|978-4309261867}}\n\n== Criticism of the work of Hasebe Hiroshi ==\n* Ogawa Setsuko, 'Power and Solitude', Mainichi Shimbun, June 17, 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20170517/ddm/015/040/013000c|title=\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30a6\u30aa\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u300e\u6a29\u529b\u3068\u5b64\u72ec\u300f \u9577\u8c37\u90e8\u6d69\u3055\u3093|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e|language=ja|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n* Watanabe Tamotsu, 'Genius and Master', Mainichi Shimbun, June 22, 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20160522/ddm/015/070/019000c|title=\u4eca\u9031\u306e\u672c\u68da\uff1a\u6e21\u8fba\u4fdd\u30fb\u8a55 \u300e\u5929\u624d\u3068\u540d\u4eba\u2212\u4e2d\u6751\u52d8\u4e09\u90ce\u3068\u5742\u6771\u4e09\u6d25\u4e94\u90ce\u300f\uff1d\u9577\u8c37\u90e8\u6d69\u30fb\u8457|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e|language=ja|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n* Yano Seiichi, 'The Secret of Beauty on the Stage', Shinch\u014dsha, December 1, 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shincho-live.jp/ebook/s/nami/2014/12/201412_13.php|title=\u66f8\u8a55\uff65\u30a8\u30c3\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc {{!}} \u6ce2 -E magazine Nami-\uff5cShincho LIVE!\uff08\u65b0\u6f6e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\uff01\uff09\uff5c \u65b0\u6f6e\u793e\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc|website=www.shincho-live.jp|language=ja|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

After the failure of the second [[Siege of Vienna (1683)]] the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] had captured large parts of the Empire's territory in Europe. The Habsburg armies came as far as [[Ni\u0161|Nis]], modern-day [[Serbia]], before being pushed back across the Danube by 1690. Sultan Mustafa II was determined to recapture the lost territories in Hungary and therefore he personally commanded his armies.\n===Capture of Chios===\nFirst, the [[Ottoman navy]] recaptured the island of [[Chios]] after defeating the Venetian Fleet twice, in the Battle of the Oinousses Islands (1695) and in the Battle of Chios (1695), in February 1695.<ref name=\"kultur1\">[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,32007/chronology.html Bilgi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2003|isbn=0810866064|page=XIIV chronology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&pg=PR44&lpg=PR44&dq=ottoman+mustafa+chios#v=onepage}}</ref> In June 1695, Mustafa II left [[Edirne]] for his first military campaign against the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. By September 1695 the town of [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]] was captured. On 18 September 1695 the Venetian Navy was again defeated in the naval victory of [[Battle of Zeytinburnu|Zeytinburnu]]. A few days later the Habsburg army was defeated in the [[Battle of Lugos]]. Afterwards the [[Ottoman Army]] returned to the capital. Meanwhile, the Ottoman fortress in [[Azov]] was [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396)|successfully defended]] against the besieging [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] forces.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nAs Mustafa attempted to realize his thoughts quickly, the island of Chios, which had previously fallen into the hands of the Venetians, was taken back at that time, the Crimean Tatars Shahbaz Giray entered the territory of Poland and proceeded to Lemberg, and returned with many captives and booty. There were reports that the Venetians were influenced by the Ottoman forces on the Herzegovina front in Peloponnese. Especially the recovery of Chios was considered auspicious and was celebrated with great festivities in Edirne. Meanwhile, the tips of the people were distributed to the locals. <ref> {{cite web|title= MUSTAFA II \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u06cc (\u00f6. 1115/1703) Osmanl\u0131 padi\u015fah\u0131 (1695-1703).|url= https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/mustafa-ii|website=\u0130slam Ansiklopedisi|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Hasburg wars===\nIn April 1696 Mustafa II left Edirne for his second military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. In August 1696 the Russians besieged Azov for the second time and captured the fortress. In August 1696 the Ottoman troops defeated the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Ula\u015f]] and in the [[Battle of Cenei]]. After these victories the Ottoman troops captured [[Timi\u0219oara]] and Koca Cafer Pasha was appointed as the protector of [[Belgrade]]. Afterwards the army returned to the Ottoman capital.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nIn June 1697 Mustafa II left the capital on his third military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. However, the Ottoman Army suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Zenta]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Elmas Mehmed Pasha]] died in the battle. Afterwards the Ottomans signed a treaty with the Holy League.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nThe most traumatic event of his reign was the loss of [[Hungary]] by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.\n\nYet even if Ottoman power seemed to wane on one side of the empire, this did not mean that Ottoman efforts at expansion ceased. In 1700, for example, the Grand Vizier [[Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha|Amcazade H\u00fcseyin]] boasted to a recalcitrant tribe residing in swamps near Baghdad that they ought to abide by the sultan's rule, since his grasp extended even to their marshy redoubts.

Mustafa II's strategy was to create an alternative base of power for himself by making the position of [[Timariot|timars]], the Ottoman cavalrymen, hereditary and thus loyal to him. The timars, however, were at this point increasingly an obsolete part of the Ottoman military machine.\n\n===Deposition===\nThe strategem failed, the disaffected troops bound to a [[Ottoman invasion of western Georgia (1703)|Georgian campaign]] mutinied in the capital (called the \"[[Edirne incident|Edirne event]]\" by historians), and Mustafa was deposed on 22 August 1703.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Character===\nDefine as red beard, short neck, medium height and majestic.

After the failure of the second [[Siege of Vienna (1683)]] the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] had captured large parts of the Empire's territory in Europe. The Habsburg armies came as far as [[Ni\u0161|Nis]], modern-day [[Serbia]], before being pushed back across the Danube by 1690. Sultan Mustafa II was determined to recapture the lost territories in Hungary and therefore he personally commanded his armies.\n===Capture of Chios===\nFirst, the [[Ottoman navy]] recaptured the island of [[Chios]] after defeating the Venetian Fleet twice, in the Battle of the Oinousses Islands (1695) and in the Battle of Chios (1695), in February 1695.<ref name=\"kultur1\">[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,32007/chronology.html Bilgi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2003|isbn=0810866064|page=XIIV chronology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&pg=PR44&lpg=PR44&dq=ottoman+mustafa+chios#v=onepage}}</ref> In June 1695, Mustafa II left [[Edirne]] for his first military campaign against the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. By September 1695 the town of [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]] was captured. On 18 September 1695 the Venetian Navy was again defeated in the naval victory of [[Battle of Zeytinburnu|Zeytinburnu]]. A few days later the Habsburg army was defeated in the [[Battle of Lugos]]. Afterwards the [[Ottoman Army]] returned to the capital. Meanwhile, the Ottoman fortress in [[Azov]] was [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396)|successfully defended]] against the besieging [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] forces.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nAs Mustafa attempted to realize his thoughts quickly, the island of Chios, which had previously fallen into the hands of the Venetians, was taken back at that time, the Crimean Tatars Shahbaz Giray entered the territory of Poland and proceeded to Lemberg, and returned with many captives and booty. There were reports that the Venetians were influenced by the Ottoman forces on the Herzegovina front in Peloponnese. Especially the recovery of Chios was considered auspicious and was celebrated with great festivities in Edirne. Meanwhile, the tips of the people were distributed to the locals. <ref> {{cite web|title= MUSTAFA II \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u06cc (\u00f6. 1115/1703) Osmanl\u0131 padi\u015fah\u0131 (1695-1703).|url= https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/mustafa-ii|website=\u0130slam Ansiklopedisi|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Hasburg wars===\nIn April 1696 Mustafa II left Edirne for his second military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. In August 1696 the Russians besieged Azov for the second time and captured the fortress. In August 1696 the Ottoman troops defeated the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Ula\u015f]] and in the [[Battle of Cenei]]. After these victories the Ottoman troops captured [[Timi\u0219oara]] and Koca Cafer Pasha was appointed as the protector of [[Belgrade]]. Afterwards the army returned to the Ottoman capital.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nIn June 1697 Mustafa II left the capital on his third military campaign against the Habsburg Empire. However, the Ottoman Army suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Zenta]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Elmas Mehmed Pasha]] died in the battle. Afterwards the Ottomans signed a treaty with the Holy League.<ref name=\"kultur1\"/>\n\nThe most traumatic event of his reign was the loss of [[Hungary]] by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.\n\nYet even if Ottoman power seemed to wane on one side of the empire, this did not mean that Ottoman efforts at expansion ceased. In 1700, for example, the Grand Vizier [[Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha|Amcazade H\u00fcseyin]] boasted to a recalcitrant tribe residing in swamps near Baghdad that they ought to abide by the sultan's rule, since his grasp extended even to their marshy redoubts.

Mustafa II's strategy was to create an alternative base of power for himself by making the position of [[Timariot|timars]], the Ottoman cavalrymen, hereditary and thus loyal to him. The timars, however, were at this point increasingly an obsolete part of the Ottoman military machine.\n\n===Deposition===\nThe strategem failed, the disaffected troops bound to a [[Ottoman invasion of western Georgia (1703)|Georgian campaign]] mutinied in the capital (called the \"[[Edirne incident|Edirne event]]\" by historians), and Mustafa was deposed on 22 August 1703.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Character===\nDefine as red beard, short neck, medium height and majestic.  Mustafa II has a miniature made by Levni.  After 1699, like his father, he was interested in hunting and entertainment, engaged in [[literature]] and wrote poems with the pseudonym.

In the tradition of ''[[You Asked for It]]'', ''[[List of Ripley's Believe It or Not! TV series|Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' and ''[[Real People]]'', the show featured people performing [[stunt]]s and reenactments of allegedly [[paranormal]] events.  The show also often featured people with unusual talents, such as speed-talker [[John Moschitta, Jr.]], who made his first national television appearance on the show, as well as scientific, medical, and technological breakthroughs such as the [[Taser]] and cryogenic corneal reshaping by lathe [[keratomileusis]]. The show's catchphrase said by one its hosts at the conclusion of a particularly amazing segment was the same as its title: \"That's incredible!\"\n\nDespite accusations of being \"sadistic\" <ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=1186}}</ref>, the series was a huge success and influenced many entertainers.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show was co-hosted by [[Fran Tarkenton]], [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]],  and [[Cathy Lee Crosby]], and was produced by [[Alan Landsburg Productions]].  Originally aired as an hour-long program, episodes were later re-edited into 30 minute segments for [[television syndication|syndication]].  It debuted on March 3, 1980.<ref name=\"onerev\">Smith, Fred L. (3 March 1980).

The dangerous nature of these stunts eventually prompted producers to augment the footage with the caption \"Do Not Try This Yourself\".  [[Steve Baker (illusionist)|Steve Baker]], also known as \"Mr. Escape\", was frequently featured on the show.\n\nThe show has been cited as an influence on [[hip-hop]] culture in [[New Zealand]], where much television programming in the 1980s was American.

In the tradition of ''[[You Asked for It]]'', ''[[List of Ripley's Believe It or Not! TV series|Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' and ''[[Real People]]'', the show featured people performing [[stunt]]s and reenactments of allegedly [[paranormal]] events.  The show also often featured people with unusual talents, such as speed-talker [[John Moschitta, Jr.]], who made his first national television appearance on the show, as well as scientific, medical, and technological breakthroughs such as the [[Taser]] and cryogenic corneal reshaping by lathe [[keratomileusis]]. The show's catchphrase said by one its hosts at the conclusion of a particularly amazing segment was the same as its title: \"That's incredible!\"\n\nDespite accusations of being \"sadistic\" <ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=1186}}</ref>, the series was a huge success and influenced many entertainers.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show was co-hosted by [[Fran Tarkenton]], [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]],  and [[Cathy Lee Crosby]], and was produced by [[Alan Landsburg Productions]].  Originally aired as an hour-long program, episodes were later re-edited into 30 minute segments for [[television syndication|syndication]].

The dangerous nature of these stunts eventually prompted producers to augment the footage with the caption \"Do Not Try This Yourself\".  [[Steve Baker (illusionist)|Steve Baker]], also known as \"Mr. Escape\", was frequently featured on the show.\n\nThe show has been cited as an influence on [[hip-hop]] culture in [[New Zealand]], where much television programming in the 1980s was American.
