In the Netherlands, this group of ideology had encouraged the establishment of an association called ''[[Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen|Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen]]'' (HMW) in Haarlem in 1752.

The initial collection was much owed to its founder, J.C.M. Radermacher that contributed his house at De Groote Rivier street along with his collection of books, manuscripts, musical instruments, currency, flora samples of dried plants, etc. At that time, collecting and donating curious rare and unique objects is regarded as a commendable endeavour, intelectually fashionable and prestigious activity among the social elites in Batavia. \nTherefore, the society's collection incresed significantly.

Baron van der Capellen]] issued a decree to form a commission to search for important objects in Java and sent them to the Batavian Society. The policy to increase the museum collection was pushed further by the Governor General [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien Baud|J.C.

To reduce its collections, therefore in 1843 zoology collections was sent out to [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Ethnology Museum]] in Leiden, while the rest was auctioned. In 1850, geological and minerology collection was sent to the newly established Physics Association.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nIn 1855, a law regarding Treasure Discovery was enacted; stipulating that all archaeological findings in the Indies had to be reported to the government, and the Batavian Society museum might buy it in the price according to the an appropriate appraisal.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nBy mid-19th century, the Batavian Society museum building in Harmoni was also considered insufficient to store and exhibit the growing collection. Although the plan to build a new museum has been conceived since 1836, it was not until 1862 the new museum finally came into reality. With the patronage of [[William III of the Netherlands|King Willem III]], the colonial government built a new building on the present location of National Museum at Jalan Merdeka Barat 12. The original building was built in Greek [[Neoclassical architecture]], and originally it has no second floor.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nThe museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian ''Zending'' and Catholic [[Missionary|Missions]], and also treasures acquired \u2014 or looted to be exact \u2014 from a numbers of military expeditions led by Dutch East Indies military throughout the archipelago against indigenous kingdoms and polities.

To reduce its collections, therefore in 1843 zoology collections was sent out to [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Ethnology Museum]] in Leiden, while the rest was auctioned. In 1850, geological and minerology collection was sent to the newly established Physics Association.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nIn 1855, a law regarding Treasure Discovery was enacted; stipulating that all archaeological findings in the Indies had to be reported to the government, and the Batavian Society museum might buy it in the price according to the an appropriate appraisal.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nBy mid-19th century, the Batavian Society museum building in Harmoni was also considered insufficient to store and exhibit the growing collection. Although the plan to build a new museum has been conceived since 1836, it was not until 1862 the new museum finally came into reality. With the patronage of [[William III of the Netherlands|King Willem III]], the colonial government built a new building on the present location of National Museum at Jalan Merdeka Barat 12. The original building was built in Greek [[Neoclassical architecture]], and originally it has no second floor.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nThe museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian ''Zending'' and Catholic [[Missionary|Missions]], and also treasures acquired \u2014 or looted to be exact \u2014 from a numbers of military expeditions led by Dutch East Indies military throughout the archipelago against indigenous kingdoms and polities. Treasures, among others from [[Aceh War|Aceh]], [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem|Lombok and Bali]] acqiured through the military expeditions led by the Dutch colonial government, also made it to the collection of Batavian Society and Leiden Museum.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\n==Other institutions established by the society==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het Zo\u00f7logisch Museum en laboratorium van 's Lands Plantentuin te Buitenzorg West-Java TMnr 10010799.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Zoological Museum of Bogor]], established in 1894 by the Batavia  of Art and Science.]]\nThe society made the plans for the [[Bogor Botanical Gardens|Hortus Botanicus Bogoriense]] in [[Bogor]] in 1817.
