Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Chauveau was the [[List of premiers of Quebec|first Premier]] of the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], following the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867.\n\nHe was a lawyer by profession, and practised in Quebec City. He co-founded the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] of Quebec City in 1842.  He was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1844, and reelected in 1848, 1851, and 1854. He served as solicitor-general of Lower Canada, without a seat in cabinet, from 1851 to 1853.  From 1855 to 1867, he was superintendent of the bureau of Education.\n\nIn [[1867 Quebec general election|1867]], he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]] in [[Qu\u00e9bec-Comt\u00e9 (provincial electoral district)|Qu\u00e9bec-Comt\u00e9]] electoral district and headed a [[Conservative Party of Quebec (historical)|Conservative]] government as the first Premier of Quebec. He was also the [[Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Minister of Education]] and [[Provincial Secretary]].  Also beginning in 1867, he was simultaneously the federal [[Member of Parliament]] for the riding of [[Quebec County (electoral district)|Quebec County]] (such \"[[dual mandate#Canada|double mandates]]\" were abolished in 1874).  He resigned both his federal and provincial seats, as well the office of Premier, on February 25, 1873, following appointment as [[Speaker of the Senate of Canada]] on February 21, 1873.  He resigned from the Senate on January 8, 1874, and later that year ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the [[1874 Canadian federal election|federal election]] in the riding of [[Charlevoix (electoral district)|Charlevoix]].\n\nIn 1878, he became professor of [[Roman law]] at [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]]. He died April 4 in [[Quebec City]] in 1890.

Chauveau was the [[List of premiers of Quebec|first Premier]] of the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], following the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867.\n\nHe was a lawyer by profession, and practised in Quebec City. He co-founded the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] of Quebec City in 1842.  He was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1844, and reelected in 1848, 1851, and 1854. He served as solicitor-general of Lower Canada, without a seat in cabinet, from 1851 to 1853.  From 1855 to 1867, he was superintendent of the bureau of Education.\n\nIn [[1867 Quebec general election|1867]], he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]] in [[Qu\u00e9bec-Comt\u00e9 (provincial electoral district)|Qu\u00e9bec-Comt\u00e9]] electoral district and headed a [[Conservative Party of Quebec (historical)|Conservative]] government as the first Premier of Quebec. He was also the [[Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Minister of Education]] and [[Provincial Secretary]].  Also beginning in 1867, he was simultaneously the federal [[Member of Parliament]] for the riding of [[Quebec County (electoral district)|Quebec County]] (such \"[[dual mandate#Canada|double mandates]]\" were abolished in 1874).  He resigned both his federal and provincial seats, as well the office of Premier, on February 25, 1873, following appointment as [[Speaker of the Senate of Canada]] on February 21, 1873.  He resigned from the Senate on January 8, 1874, and later that year ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the [[1874 Canadian federal election|federal election]] in the riding of [[Charlevoix (electoral district)|Charlevoix]].\n\nIn 1878, he became professor of [[Roman law]] at [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]].
