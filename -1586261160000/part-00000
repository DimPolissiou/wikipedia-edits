It lies on the northern rim of the Vale of Pewsey, and is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, two miles beyond Adam's Grave.  The hilltop contains a smaller banked enclosure next to the Neolithic site, which appears to have been occupied from just before the arrival of the Romans until Saxon times.  This second enclosure was also briefly occupied during the 17th century, perhaps by shepherds.  Two barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  A Saxon sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.\n\nThe site is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified.  Benjamin and Maud Cunnington spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud Cunnington published two reports of their work, noting that there were multiple gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of Windmill Hill among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the neolithic period.  Originally they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayred enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by Graham Connah, who found a later burial in one of the ditches.  Connah kept excellent stratigraphic documentation of his finds, and this was taken advantage of by the Gathering Time project, which in 2011 published an analysis of radiocarbon dates from almost forty British causewayed enclosures.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch was filled by between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since the land may have had to be cleared which would have required substantial labour.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Cecil Curwen identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

The western barrow was about two feet high, with a small ditch around it.  Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, two feet deep and two feet across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about a foot high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.<ref name=\":11\">Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.</ref><ref name=\":10\">Cunnington (1912), p. 43.</ref>\n\n=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908-9 ===\nThe Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by [[Maud Cunnington|Maud]] and [[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin Cunnington]], in the summers of 1908 and 1909.  ODB 12.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner (marked S\u2013S on the plan).<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>  Most of the relics obtained from the ditches of the old enclosure were found in clusters, and were usually within a foot of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone.  The only human bone found was a small jaw bone with worn teeth.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 60\u201361.</ref>  The pottery was coarse, with flint inclusions, and was found associated with flint flakes, leading Maud Cunnington to suggest that the people who used the pottery may have been Neolithic, though she concluded that the inability to tell undecorated pottery of the [[Bronze Age]] and Neolithic periods apart meant that it was not possible to confidently assign a period.<ref name=\":15\">Cunnington (1912), p. 50.</ref><ref name=\":14\">Cunnington (1912), pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  The Cunningtons found several [[flint-knapping]] clusters, including one group of seventy-two flint chips six foot deep in the ditch.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 61-62.</ref><ref name=\":18\">Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 97-98.</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Cunnington that the plateau enclosure was much more recent than the old enclosure, since the plateau enclosure's southwestern ditch was dug through the old enclosure's ditch, which had silted up almost completely by that time.  Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; Cunnington cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=2|Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  Cunnington found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about 2 feet deep, and 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Saxons|Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound. A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a quern, damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 52\u201354.</ref>\n\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), 23 feet by 13 1/2 feet, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the relics at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the wals and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but Cunnington found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from the fourth causeway, counting clockwise from the left of the plan.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The western bank led for fifty yards towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds would have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches from the 1961 excavation]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like Cunnington, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least 20 miles away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found.  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments could not be accurately dated.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 12.</ref><ref>Connah (1965), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about 5 feet 2 inches tall.  She suffered from osteo-arthritis, and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of the fourth causeway found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  Neither ditch was noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good association with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch was filled by between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99-102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795-812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304-305|via=|issue=172|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42-65|via=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, two feet deep and two feet across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about a foot high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.<ref name=\":11\">Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.</ref><ref name=\":10\">Cunnington (1912), p. 43.</ref>\n\n=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908-9 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

ODB 12.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\nThis was the first time that causewayed ditches had been identified,<ref name=\":4\">Connah (1965), p. 1.</ref> though earlier excavations had taken place at sites now known to be causewayed enclosures.<ref name=\":3\">Andersen (2019), p. 795.</ref>{{#tag:ref|For example, [[Peu-Richard culture|Peu-Richard]], in western France, was excavated in 1882 by [[Eug\u00e8ne Eschass\u00e9riaux|Baron Eschass\u00e9riaux]].<ref name=\":3\" />|group=notes}}  By the time the second summer's work had been completed, every causeway had been excavated sufficiently to prove that the ditches ended where the above-ground evidence indicated.<ref>Cunnington (1912), p. 59.</ref>\n\nThe discovery of a second enclosure, to the northeast of the original target of their excavation, complicated the Cunningtons' work.<ref name=\":10\" />  They labelled the new enclosure the \"Plateau Enclosure\" to distinguish it from the \"Old Camp\".<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\">Cunnington (1912), p. 49.</ref>  In the old enclosure, they cleared a 54 foot long stretch of the second ditch (counting clockwise from the left), and discovered that the width and depth varied greatly, from seven feet deep and ten feet wide at the west end of the section, to eight feet deep and only eighteen inches wide at the east end.  They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>  Most of the relics obtained from the ditches of the old enclosure were found within a foot of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone.  The only human bone found was a small jaw bone with worn teeth.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 60\u201361.</ref>  The pottery was coarse, with flint inclusions, and was found associated with flint flakes, leading Maud Cunnington to suggest that the people who used the pottery may have been Neolithic, though she concluded that the inability to tell undecorated pottery of the [[Bronze Age]] and Neolithic periods apart meant that it was not possible to confidently assign a period.<ref>Cunnington (1912), p. 50.</ref><ref name=\":14\">Cunnington (1912), pp. 56\u201357.</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Cunnington that the plateau enclosure was much more recent than the old enclosure, since the plateau enclosure's southwestern ditch was dug through the old enclosure's ditch, which had silted up almost completely by that time.  Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early Iron Age.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  A ditch and low rampart surrounded the enclosure, but were mostly undetectable on the surface; Cunnington cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== C.W.

Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds would have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.

It  pitted [[House of Capet|Capetian]] troops under King [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and his brother [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers|Alphonse of Poitiers]] against [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] and King [[Henry III of England]]'s forces. {{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Taillebourg\n| partof      = the [[Saintonge War]]\n| image       = Louis9 vs Henri3.jpg\n| image_size  = 300\n| caption     = Battle between the French (Louis IX) and the English (Henry III).

The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the French, and the end to the [[Poitiers, France|Poitevin]] revolt. It also announced the end of Henry's hopes of restoring the [[Angevin Empire]] lost under King [[John I of England]].\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Saintonge War}}\nBy the terms of his will, [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] had given the title of [[Count of Poitiers|Count of Poitou]] to his younger son Alphonse. In June 1241, Louis IX held a plenary court at [[Saumur]] in [[Anjou]] and announced that Alphonse, having come of age, was ready to come into possession. Many nobles from Aquitaine attended the court, among them [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]] and her husband, the [[County of La Marche|Count of La Marche]], Hugh de Lusignan. After the meeting at Saumur, Louis went to Poitiers and installed his brother as the Count of Poitiers. The [[House of Lusignan|Lusignans]] were not receptive to Capetian authority in the region. Isabella was particularly frustrated that her son, the [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Earl of Cornwall]] and brother to King Henry III, had not received the title. Shortly after his arrival at Poitiers, Louis learned that Hugh had assembled an army at the nearby town of Lusignan. Talks between Louis and Alphonse and Hugh and Isabella did not resolve the dispute.\n\nIn April 1242, Louis assembled a force at [[Chinon]] that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000 men consisting of [[Knight|knights]], [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], and [[Infantry|foot soldiers]] and captured a multitude of rebel castles. On 20 May 1242, King Henry III of England arrived at Royan and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000 which varied in unit types. The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing. The battle would inevitably take place at Taillebourg.\n\n==Unfolding of the battle (The first phase)==\n[[File:Taillebourg (Charente-Maritime) ch\u00e2teau, la tour.JPG|thumb|Ch\u00e2teau de Taillebourg, the tower that overlooks the bridge on the Charente river. ]]\nOn 21 July, the two armies faced each other across the bridge. The king of France and the count of Poitiers were installed in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Taillebourg]], which overlooked the bridge over the [[Charente (river)|Charente]], a strategic passage between [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly]] and Poitou in the north and between [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[Aquitaine]] in the South. The king of England and the count of La Marche set up their joint army on the opposing side of the river.\n\nDetermined to take the bridge, the English and the rebels made the first move by attempting to charge the French on the other side. The battle ended in a massive counter-charge of the French knights, who sallied forth from the castle and harried their adversaries, who were compelled to flee to Saintes.\n\n==The second phase==\nAfter the setback in the Taillebourg engagement, which permitted the French to control the strategic bridge, Henry and Hugh both individually fled to Saintes, and then to [[Gascony]], and the Franco-Poitevins exploited their advantage upon the now leaderless English and rebel army. On 22 July, a field battle took place north of Saintes. A prolonged melee fight ensued, however, the English were later beaten once more in definitive fashion. These two actions constituted the Battle of Taillebourg.\n\n==The aftermath==\n[[File:Henry3 LouisIX.jpg|left|thumb|Henry III does homage to Louis IX.]]\nLouis continued to pursue the English troops, capturing many prisoners, until arriving upon the city of Saintes. After a short siege, the keys of the city were handed to Louis by the citizens of Saintes. Henry tried one last time to prevent a complete takeover of his lands in Aquitaine and Gasgony by organizing the blockade of [[La Rochelle]] by sea. However, the blockade failed along with the attempt to rebuild an army and build an alliance with other European monarchs. On January 1243, Henry sent a letter to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], to whom he had made a request for an alliance earlier, announcing the end of his hopes for retaking his possessions in France. On 12 March, Henry was forced to ask Louis for a five-year truce.\n\nThe truce was signed at [[Pons, Charente-Maritime|Pons]], on 1 August. A more lasting [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace was concluded at Paris]], on 4 December 1259, amidst the threat of a [[Second Barons' War|second Baron's war]] in England.

The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the French, and the end to the [[Poitiers, France|Poitevin]] revolt. It also announced the end of Henry's hopes of restoring the [[Angevin Empire]] lost under King [[John I of England]].\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Saintonge War}}\nBy the terms of his will, [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] had given the title of [[Count of Poitiers|Count of Poitou]] to his younger son Alphonse. In June 1241, Louis IX held a plenary court at [[Saumur]] in [[Anjou]] and announced that Alphonse, having come of age, was ready to come into possession. Many nobles from Aquitaine attended the court, among them [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]] and her husband, the [[County of La Marche|Count of La Marche]], Hugh de Lusignan. After the meeting at Saumur, Louis went to Poitiers and installed his brother as the Count of Poitiers. The [[House of Lusignan|Lusignans]] were not receptive to Capetian authority in the region. Isabella was particularly frustrated that her son, the [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Earl of Cornwall]] and brother to King Henry III, had not received the title. Shortly after his arrival at Poitiers, Louis learned that Hugh had assembled an army at the nearby town of Lusignan. Talks between Louis and Alphonse and Hugh and Isabella did not resolve the dispute.\n\nIn April 1242, Louis assembled a force at [[Chinon]] that some contemporaries estimated at around 50,000 men consisting of [[Knight|knights]], [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], and [[Infantry|foot soldiers]] and captured a multitude of rebel castles. On 20 May 1242, King Henry III of England arrived at Royan and joined the rebelling French nobles, forming an army that may have numbered about 30,000 which varied in unit types. The two kings exchanged letters, but these resolved nothing. The battle would inevitably take place at Taillebourg.\n\n==Unfolding of the battle (The first phase)==\n[[File:Taillebourg (Charente-Maritime) ch\u00e2teau, la tour.JPG|thumb|Ch\u00e2teau de Taillebourg, the tower that overlooks the bridge on the Charente river. ]]\nOn 21 July, the two armies faced each other across the bridge. The king of France and the count of Poitiers were installed in the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Taillebourg]], which overlooked the bridge over the [[Charente (river)|Charente]], a strategic passage between [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly]] and Poitou in the north and between [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[Aquitaine]] in the South. The king of England and the count of La Marche set up their joint army on the opposing side of the river.\n\nDetermined to take the bridge, the English and the rebels made the first move by attempting to charge the French on the other side. The battle ended in a massive counter-charge of the French knights, who sallied forth from the castle and harried their adversaries, who were compelled to flee to Saintes.\n\n==The second phase==\nAfter the setback in the Taillebourg engagement, which permitted the French to control the strategic bridge, Henry and Hugh both individually fled to Saintes, and then to [[Gascony]], and the Franco-Poitevins exploited their advantage upon the now leaderless English and rebel army. On 22 July, a field battle took place north of Saintes. A prolonged melee fight ensued, however, the English were later beaten once more in definitive fashion. These two actions constituted the Battle of Taillebourg.\n\n==The aftermath==\n[[File:Henry3 LouisIX.jpg|left|thumb|Henry III does homage to Louis IX.]]\nLouis continued to pursue the English troops, capturing many prisoners, until arriving upon the city of Saintes. After a short siege, the keys of the city were handed to Louis by the citizens of Saintes. Henry tried one last time to prevent a complete takeover of his lands in Aquitaine and Gasgony by organizing the blockade of [[La Rochelle]] by sea. However, the blockade failed along with the attempt to rebuild an army and build an alliance with other European monarchs. On January 1243, Henry sent a letter to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], to whom he had made a request for an alliance earlier, announcing the end of his hopes for retaking his possessions in France. On 12 March, Henry was forced to ask Louis for a five-year truce.\n\nThe truce was signed at [[Pons, Charente-Maritime|Pons]], on 1 August. A more lasting [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace was concluded at Paris]], on 4 December 1259, amidst the threat of a [[Second Barons' War|second Baron's war]] in England. The king of France restored Guyenne to Henry as a noble gesture and to seek for further peace so that he could focus on going to the Seventh Crusade.\n\nThe settlement of the feudal revolt was less advantageous for Hugh of Lusignan. His Poitevin castles were confiscated, rearmed, and sold by Alphonse of Poitiers. His daughter Isabel of Lusignan was married to his enemy Geoffrey of Rancon, lord of Gen\u00e7ay, in 1250, who rebuilt his castle with the dowry.\n\n==Works of art==\n[[File:The Battle of Taillebourg, 21st July 1242.png|thumb|''The Battle of Taillebourg won by Saint Louis'', by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix ([[Galerie des Batailles]], 1837, [[Palace of Versailles]])]]\nThe battle is the subject of an anonymous trouv\u00e8re song, ''Molt lieement dirai mon serventois'' (RS 1835); it was written in support of Louis and his allies and mentions several historical figures by name.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Antoine |date=1892 |title=Une chanson fran\u00e7aise sur la bataille de Taillebourg|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/anami_0003-4398_1892_num_4_15_6607 |department=Annales du Midi |journal=Revue arch\u00e9ologique, historique et philologique de la France m\u00e9ridionale |volume=4 |issue=15 |pages=362\u2013370}}</ref>\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] represented the battle in his tableau ''The Battle of Taillebourg won by Saint Louis'', which was presented to the \u2018Salon\u2019 in 1837.

He first played on the European Tour in 1982, and has been a member since. He won seven individual titles on the  European tour and finished in the top ten of the Order of Merit three times, with a best of fourth place in 1992. In 1993, he became the first Swedish golfer to play in all four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] in the same year. Forsbrand led Sweden to victory in both the [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]] and the [[Alfred Dunhill Cup|Dunhill Cup]] in 1991. He had a special penchant for low scoring and still shares the record for the lowest final two rounds in a major championship, scoring 130 in the 1994 Open.\n\nIn 2004, [[Bernhard Langer]], the European [[Ryder Cup]] Captain, named Forsbrand as his vice-captain for the [[2004 Ryder Cup|35th Ryder Cup Matches]] against the United States at [[Oakland Hills Country Club]], in which the European team had a resounding victory over the US Team.\n\nForsbrand began playing on the [[European Senior Tour]] after turning 50 in 2011. In August 2012, he won the [[SSE Scottish Senior Open]], becoming the first Swede to win on the European Senior Tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/seniortour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012866/news/newsid=170002.html#historic+scottish+swede+forsbrand |title=Historic Scottish win for Swede Forsbrand |publisher=PGA European Tour |date=19 August 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe was three times awarded [[Swedish Golfer of the Year]];
