served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|25th Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1996 to 2007. He is the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister, behind only Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who was in office for over 18 years. He is also the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by age|oldest living former Australian Prime Minister]], having been so since the death of [[Bob Hawke]] on 16 May 2019. Howard was leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] from 1985 to 1989 and from 1995 to 2007.\n\nHoward was born in [[Sydney]] and studied law at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], he first stood for office at the [[1968 New South Wales state election]], but lost narrowly. At the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 federal election]], Howard was elected to the [[Division of Bennelong]], which he would go on to represent until 2007. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced [[Phillip Lynch]] as [[Treasurer of Australia]], remaining in that position until the defeat of [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s government [[1983 Australian federal election|in 1983]].\n\nIn 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing [[Andrew Peacock]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He led the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal\u2013National coalition]] to the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 federal election]], but lost to [[Bob Hawke]]'s Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995 (replacing [[Alexander Downer]]), and subsequently led the Coalition to victory at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]].\n\nAfter defeating [[Paul Keating]]'s Labor government in 1996, the [[Howard Government]] was re-elected at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998]], [[2001 Australian federal election|2001]] and [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 elections]]. Howard's actions as prime minister included [[Gun laws in Australia|new gun laws]] (in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]]), the introduction of [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|a nationwide value-added tax]], [[Pacific Solution|immigration reform]], and [[WorkChoices|industrial relations reform]]. Australia also contributed troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]] under his government, and led the [[International Force for East Timor]]. The Howard government was defeated at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], with the Labor Party's [[Kevin Rudd]] succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat at the election, becoming only the second prime minister to do so (after [[Stanley Bruce]] in [[1929 Australian federal election|1929]]).\n\n==Early and personal life==\n[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of John Howard as a boy, taken in the 1940s|Howard as a boy, 1940s]]\nJohn Winston Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''n\u00e9e'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]].

July 1939) is an Australian former politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|25th Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1996 to 2007. He is the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister, behind only Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who was in office for over 18 years. He is also the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by age|oldest living former Australian Prime Minister]], having been so since the death of [[Bob Hawke]] on 16 May 2019. Howard was leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] from 1985 to 1989 and from 1995 to 2007.\n\nHoward was born in [[Sydney]] and studied law at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], he first stood for office at the [[1968 New South Wales state election]], but lost narrowly. At the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 federal election]], Howard was elected to the [[Division of Bennelong]], which he would go on to represent until 2007. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced [[Phillip Lynch]] as [[Treasurer of Australia]], remaining in that position until the defeat of [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s government [[1983 Australian federal election|in 1983]].\n\nIn 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing [[Andrew Peacock]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He led the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal\u2013National coalition]] to the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 federal election]], but lost to [[Bob Hawke]]'s Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995 (replacing [[Alexander Downer]]), and subsequently led the Coalition to victory at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]].\n\nAfter defeating [[Paul Keating]]'s Labor government in 1996, the [[Howard Government]] was re-elected at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998]], [[2001 Australian federal election|2001]] and [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 elections]]. Howard's actions as prime minister included [[Gun laws in Australia|new gun laws]] (in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]]), the introduction of [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|a nationwide value-added tax]], [[Pacific Solution|immigration reform]], and [[WorkChoices|industrial relations reform]]. Australia also contributed troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]] under his government, and led the [[International Force for East Timor]]. The Howard government was defeated at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], with the Labor Party's [[Kevin Rudd]] succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat at the election, becoming only the second prime minister to do so (after [[Stanley Bruce]] in [[1929 Australian federal election|1929]]).\n\n==Early and personal life==\n[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of John Howard as a boy, taken in the 1940s|Howard as a boy, 1940s]]\nJohn Winston Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''n\u00e9e'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]].

Bjelke-Petersen abandoned his bid for Prime Minister a month before the election.  However, the damage had already been done.  The end of the Coalition agreement led to a large number of three-cornered contests.  Additionally, a number of swing voters outside Queensland were alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, and voted for Labor in order to ensure that the Liberals and Nationals would be defeated.

The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right with 75 seats, the most that the party had ever won.

However, the uneven nature of the swing allowed Howard to win a second term in government, with a considerably reduced majority (from 45 seats to 12).

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]]. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|pp=218\u2013219}} The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Attreed|2001|p=128}} Elizabeth was already well connected\u2014her brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\u2014and this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]].\n\nBonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William]], married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} Two of Bonville's daughters\u2014Margaret and Philippa{{Refn|name=\"P\"|group=note}}\u2014married William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} married an important Midlands landowner, [[William Tailboys|Sir William Tailboys]] by November 1446.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=580}} These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} John married Alice Denys and was [[Financial endowment|endowed]] in 1453.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} On Bonville's death, he bequesthed John a \"substantial\" property. He died in 1499.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} {{Location map|Devon|width=230|float=right|caption=The location of Shute, Bonville's birthplace, within Devon and England.|label=Shute|mark=Red_pog.svg|lat_deg=|lon_deg=|lat=50.7712|long=-3.0602}}\n\n=== Estates and wealth ===\nBonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} As such, when Bonville [[Age of majority|came of age]] in 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} he inherited an income of approximately \u00a3900 per annum; for context, the historian [[Martin Cherry]] says this was \"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} His lands\u2014comprising 18 manors{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014were situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and [[Wiltshire]]. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in [[Leicestershire]], the [[East Midlands]], and the southeast of England in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOwing to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively,{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in [[dower]].{{Refn|The legal concept of dower had existed since the late twelfth century as a means of protecting a woman from being left landless if her husband died first.

By the fifteenth century, the widow was deemed entitled to her dower;{{sfn|Kenny|2003|pp=59\u201360}} the historian [[Rowena Archer]] argues that this made it \"one of the most destructive of baronial incidents\" on account of how a long-lived [[dowager]] could reduce an inheritance over generations.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=16}}|group=note}} His mother had remarried in 1397, to [[Richard Stucley]],{{refn|Also spelled Styuecle.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}}|group=note}} an important [[Essex]] landowner.

Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Mudford Sock]], and as a result, says the ''[[History of Parliament]]'', \"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n== Political career and royal service ==\n[[File:Taunton Castle 03.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Taunton Castle in 2017|thumb|The main gate, in 2017, of Bonville's castle at Taunton, which was besieged by the Earl of Devon|left]]\nBonville undertook [[Hundred Years' War|royal service in France]] in 1415, and joined Henry V's [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]], travelling in the [[retinue]] of the King's brother, [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]]. While in [[Normandy]], sometime before his seventeenth birthday, Bonville was knighted.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{refn|It is unknown, however, whether Bonville fought in the Battle of Agincourt itself.

During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling\u2014or unable\u2014to impose the [[Peace (law)|King's peace]] in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his [[favourite]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]],{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=291}} and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Refn|William Tailboys has been described by the historian [[Roger Virgoe]] as \"exceptionally violent and unscrupulous even for that age\".

In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent.

By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A.

He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense.

Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendancy ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.''

The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition.

This act effectively granted York the throne on Henry's death, and thus disinherited the Prince of Wales.

York and the Earl of Salisbury, with their smaller army, marched north the following month; Bonville remained in London. Bonville's son William marched with York, and died with him at the [[Battle of Wakefield]], where the Yorkist army went down to a crushing defeat by the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian army]] on 30 December 1460.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}}\n\n====Second Battle of St Albans====\nThe Lancastrians proceeded to march south; Salisbury's son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], had been left in charge of the King in London.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville, who had been in the southwest raising an army, returned to London.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S.

Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf.

He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Occupying an area of {{convert|588.36|km2|sqmi}},<ref>[http://www.noegletal.dk Economy and Interior Ministry: Municipal Key Figures]</ref> the island had a total population of 39,572 on 1 January 2019.\n\nAmong Bornholm's chief industrial activities are [[dairy farming]] and [[arts and crafts]] industries such as [[glass production]] and [[pottery]] using locally worked [[clay]]. [[Tourism]] is also important during the summer months. The island is home to a large number of Denmark's [[Nordic round churches|round churches]].\n\nThe island is known as ''solskins\u00f8en'' (''Sunshine Island'') because of its weather and ''klippe\u00f8en'' (''Rock Island'') because of its geology, which consists of [[granite]], except along the southern coast. The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October. As a result of the climate, a local variety of the [[common fig]], known as ''Bornholm's Diamond'', can grow locally on the island.  The island's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of [[Denmark]], which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and [[deciduous]] forests (greatly affected by storms in the 1950s), farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.<ref>{{cite book| last = Blecher| first = Lone Thygesen|author2=George Blecher| title = Swedish Folktales & Legends| date = August 2004| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4575-6| pages = xvi }}</ref>\n\nStrategically located in the [[Baltic Sea]], Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. Usually it had been ruled by Denmark, but also by [[Sweden]] and [[L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck, Germany]]. The ruin of [[Hammershus]], at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest [[castle#History|medieval fortress]] in [[northern Europe]], testament to the importance of its location. This island and [[Ertholmene]] is what remains in Denmark of [[Sk\u00e5neland]] east of [[\u00d8resund]], having been surrendered to Sweden in [[Treaty of Roskilde|1658]] but with Bornholm after a local revolt later regained in [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|1660]].\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Bornholmsk dialect}}\n\nMany inhabitants speak the [[Bornholmsk dialect]], which is officially a [[Danish language#Dialects|dialect of Danish]].<ref>Peter Skautrup, ''Det Danske Sprogs Historie'', Gyldendal, 1968, vol. 4, p. 105ff. (Danish)</ref> Bornholmsk retains three [[grammatical gender]]s, like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]].

This makes the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish speakers. However, [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]] often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish.

It is the result of a merger of the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island ([[Allinge-Gudhjem Municipality|Allinge-Gudhjem]], [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Nex\u00f8]], [[R\u00f8nne]] and [[Aakirkeby]]) and the former [[Bornholm County]]. Bornholm Regional Municipality was also a county in its own right during its first four years from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2006. From 1 January 2007 all counties were abolished, and Bornholm became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]] whose main responsibility is the health service. The municipality still retains its name Bornholm ''Regional'' Municipality. The island had 21 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 15 parishes. In addition to supervising parish municipalities, which was the responsibility of the counties in ''all'' of Denmark, the market town municipalities of Bornholm were supervised by Bornholm County as well and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, R\u00f8nne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. The question on the [[ballot]] was, \"Do you want the six municipal entities of Bornholm to be joined to form one municipal entity as of 1 January 2003?\" 73.9% voted in favour. The lowest percentage for the merger was in [[Nex\u00f8]] municipality (966 more people voting \"Yes\" than \"No\"), whose mayor, Annelise Molin, a Social Democrat, spoke out against the merger. It was required that each municipality had more \"Yes\" votes than \"No\" votes. Otherwise the merger would have to be abandoned altogether. The six municipal entities had 122 councillors (of which county clls were 15) and the new regional municipality would have 27 councillors from the start. They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018 ([[2017 Danish local elections|election November 2017]]). The merger was approved in a law by the [[Folketing]] 19 March 2002, transferring the tasks of the abolished county and old municipalities to the new ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. The first regional mayor in the first three years from 2003 until 2005 was Thomas Thors (born 28 July 1949), a physician and member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and previously the last mayor of R\u00f8nne Municipality for five years from 1998 until 2002. Bjarne Kristiansen, who was the last mayor of [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]] 2\u00bd years from the summer of 2000 until 2002, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor for four years from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2007, Bornholm became a part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]]. From January 1, 2010 the mayor has been Winni Grosb\u00f8ll, a high school teacher and a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokratiet'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFerry services connect R\u00f8nne to [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie]] ([[Poland]]), [[Sassnitz]] ([[Germany]]), [[K\u00f8ge]], {{convert|45|km|abbr=off}} by road ({{convert|34|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}} as the crow flies) south of Copenhagen, [[Denmark]]; the destination to K\u00f8ge replaced the nighttime route directly to and from Copenhagen (for both cargo and passengers) from 1 October 2004; and [[HSC Leonora Christina|catamaran]] services to [[Ystad]] ([[Sweden]]). [[Simrishamn]] ([[Sweden]]) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular [[catamaran]] services between [[Nex\u00f8]] and the Polish ports of [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], [[\u0141eba]] and [[Ustka]]. There are direct bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also flights from [[Bornholm Airport]] to Copenhagen and other locations.\n\nBecause of its remote location Bornholm Regional Municipality has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], and is its own employment region, and also performs other tasks normally carried out by the regions in the rest of Denmark. In some respects the municipality forms a region of its own.\n\nBornholm Regional Municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 in the nationwide [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|Municipal Reform of 2007]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\nThe larger towns on the island are located on the coast and have harbours. There is however one exception, centrally placed [[Aakirkeby]], which was also the name of the municipality from 1970 until 2002, which did, however, include the harbor, Boderne, {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} to the south. The largest town is [[R\u00f8nne]], the seat, in the southwest. The other main towns (clockwise round the island) are [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Allinge-Sandvig]], [[Gudhjem]], [[Svaneke]] and [[Nex\u00f8]]. Monday morning 22 September 2014 it was documented by ''Folkeregistret'' in the municipality that the number of people living in the municipality that day were 39,922, the lowest number in over 100 years.<ref name=40k>[http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE7049169/der-bor-nu-under-40000-pa-bornholm/ Der bor nu under 40.000 p\u00e5 Bornholm]. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 25 September 2014.</ref>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, [[Statistics Denmark]] gave the populations as follows:<ref>[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&PLanguage=1 \"BY1: Population 1st January, by urban area, age, and gender\"] database from [[Statistics Denmark]].

It was originally administratively part of the province of [[Scania]] and was administered by the [[Scanian Law]] after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the [[Archbishop of Lund|See of Lund]] and the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish crown]] culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was ''[[Gamleborg]]'' which was replaced by ''[[Lilleborg, Bornholm|Lilleborg]]'', built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four [[Hundred (country subdivision)|herreder]] (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, [[Hammershus]]. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.\n\n===Modern===\nBornholm was pawned to [[L\u00fcbeck]] for 50 years starting in 1525.

The island's perfect central position in the [[Baltic Sea]] meant that it was an important \"natural fortress\" between [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries, which had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.\n\nOn 22 August 1943 a [[V-1 flying bomb]] (numbered V83, probably launched from a [[Heinkel He 111]]) crashed on Bornholm during a test \u2013 the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This was the first sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets which were to become known as V-1 and [[V-2]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mindling |first1=George |last2=Bolton |first2=Robert |title=U.S. Air Force Tactical Missiles, 1949-1969: The Pioneers |date=2011 |publisher=Lulu.com |location=Morrisville, NC, USA |pages=4 }}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Soviet occupation (1945\u20131946) ===\nBornholm was heavily bombarded by the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] in May 1945, as it was a part of the Eastern Front. The German garrison commander, German Navy Captain [[List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Ka-Km)|Gerhard von Kamptz]] (1902\u20131998), refused to surrender to the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], as his orders were to surrender to the Western Allies. The Germans sent several telegrams to Copenhagen requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the Western Allied forces instead of the Soviets. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in [[R\u00f8nne]] and [[Nex\u00f8]] and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7\u20138 May 1945. The population had been forewarned of the bombardments, and the towns were evacuated, but 10 local people were killed. Soldiers were also killed and wounded. Some of them were [[Baltic states|Baltic]] allies of Germany fighting the Soviets.\n\nDuring the Soviet bombing of the two main towns on 7 and 8 May, Danish radio was not allowed to broadcast the news because it was thought it would spoil the liberation festivities in Denmark.<ref>En \u00d8 i krig / An island at war by B\u00f8rge Kure</ref> On 9 May Soviet troops landed on the island, and after a short fight, the German garrison (about 12,000 strong<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261|title=Soviet Information Bureau report|date=11 May 1945|accessdate=2007-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720160020/http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261#|archive-date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) surrendered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2|title=Bornholm during World War II|accessdate=2007-09-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023108/http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Soviet forces left the island on 5 April 1946.

This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, US troops in particular.<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf Vojtech Mastny, \"NATO in the Beholder\u2019s Eye: Soviet Perceptions and Policies, 1949\u201356\".

It is headquartered in [[Belgium]].\n\n===Electricity supply===\nBornholm is connected to the Swedish electricity grid by a submarine 60 kV AC cable, which is among the longest AC cables in Europe. This cable is capable of delivering all the electrical energy consumed on Bornholm. However Bornholm also generates its own electricity at small thermal power plants and especially [[wind turbine]]s.\n\nBornholm is also home to a large internationally funded demonstration project to test the viability of novel energy market mechanisms to regulate energy networks with a high prevalence of renewables (such as wind turbines and photovoltaics). 50% of the project is EU-funded, with the remainder coming mainly from large corporations. See http://www.eu-ecogrid.net/ecogrid-eu for more.\n\n==Climate==\nBornholm has an [[oceanic climate]] relatively similar to southern Sweden and mainland Denmark, whose summer highs and winter lows are heavily moderated by its maritime and isolated position. Even though heat is rare, the climate is sunny during summers and rainfall is generally sparse for a climate of this type. The winter (November\u2013December) 2010 \u2013 (January\u2013April) 2011 was exceptionally extreme with snow depth reaching at least 146 [[centimeter|cm]], 2 inches short of 5 [[foot (unit)|feet]] ([[snowdrift]]s 6 [[Metre|meters]], almost 20 feet) the highest in Northern Europe. Military assistance was needed. The [[Danish Meteorological Institute|DMI]] estimated the weight of snow to be 100 [[million]] [[ton]].  2013 was a cold year, with only June, July, and August being warm.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Bornholm (1971\u20132000)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 8.9\n| Feb record high C = 9.7\n| Mar record high C = 15.1\n| Apr record high C = 26.6\n| May record high C = 27.2\n| Jun record high C = 31.7\n| Jul record high C = 31.9\n| Aug record high C = 32.0\n| Sep record high C = 27.9\n| Oct record high C = 20.2\n| Nov record high C = 15.7\n| Dec record high C = 11.0\n|year record high C = 32.0\n| Jan high C = 2.7\n| Feb high C = 2.4\n| Mar high C = 4.5\n| Apr high C = 8.9\n| May high C = 14.5\n| Jun high C = 17.9\n| Jul high C = 20.1\n| Aug high C = 20.5\n| Sep high C = 16.4\n| Oct high C = 11.9\n| Nov high C = 7.3\n| Dec high C = 4.4\n|year high C = 10.9\n| Jan mean C = 0.9\n| Feb mean C = 0.4\n| Mar mean C = 2.1\n| Apr mean C = 5.5\n| May mean C = 10.5\n| Jun mean C = 14.3\n| Jul mean C = 16.8\n| Aug mean C = 17.0\n| Sep mean C = 13.4\n| Oct mean C = 9.5\n| Nov mean C = 5.4\n| Dec mean C = 2.6\n|year mean C = 8.2\n| Jan low C = \u22121.1\n| Feb low C = \u22121.7\n| Mar low C = \u22120.4\n| Apr low C = 2.1\n| May low C = 6.6\n| Jun low C = 10.7\n| Jul low C = 13.3\n| Aug low C = 13.4\n| Sep low C = 10.5\n| Oct low C = 6.9\n| Nov low C = 3.2\n| Dec low C = 0.5\n|year low C = 5.3\n| Jan record low C = -15.7\n| Feb record low C = -17.7\n| Mar record low C = -16.1\n| Apr record low C = -7.0\n| May record low C = -3.0\n| Jun record low C = -0.2\n| Jul record low C = 4.0\n| Aug record low C = 5.4\n| Sep record low C = -0.2\n| Oct record low C = -5.7\n| Nov record low C = -10.1\n| Dec record low C = -14.1\n|year record low C = -17.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 40.2\n| Feb precipitation mm = 22.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 30.6\n| Apr precipitation mm = 30.2\n| May precipitation mm = 31.9\n| Jun precipitation mm = 44.2\n| Jul precipitation mm = 47.1\n| Aug precipitation mm = 41.4\n| Sep precipitation mm = 55.5\n| Oct precipitation mm = 50.2\n| Nov precipitation mm = 52.1\n| Dec precipitation mm = 42.4\n|year precipitation mm = 488.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 16.5\n| Feb precipitation days = 12.9\n| Mar precipitation days = 13.7\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.2\n| May precipitation days = 10.0\n| Jun precipitation days = 11.0\n| Jul precipitation days = 10.6\n| Aug precipitation days = 10.8\n| Sep precipitation days = 13.2\n| Oct precipitation days = 14.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 16.7\n| Dec precipitation days = 16.1\n|year precipitation days = 157.3\n| Jan snow days = 5.6\n| Feb snow days = 5.3\n| Mar snow days = 4.0\n| Apr snow days = 0.9\n| May snow days = 0.1\n| Jun snow days = 0.0\n| Jul snow days = 0.0\n| Aug snow days = 0.0\n| Sep snow days = 0.0\n| Oct snow days = 0.0\n| Nov snow days = 1.8\n| Dec snow days = 3.4\n|year snow days = 21.2\n| Jan sun = 35\n| Feb sun = 53\n| Mar sun = 112\n| Apr sun = 190\n| May sun = 284\n| Jun sun = 266\n| Jul sun = 276\n| Aug sun = 252\n| Sep sun = 155\n| Oct sun = 102\n| Nov sun = 46\n| Dec sun = 31\n|year sun = 1809\n|source 1 = Danish Meteorological Institute<ref name = DMI1>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/Rapporter/TR/2002/tr02-12.pdf\n| title = Danish Climatological Normals 1971\u20132000 for selected stations\n| publisher = [[Danish Meteorological Institute]]\n| accessdate = 17 November 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Sports ==\nBornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water-based sports. Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical yachts are raced in one-on-one events on the water. The [[Danish Open (yachting)|Danish Open]] event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of R\u00f8nne on the western coast of Bornholm. The five-day Danish Open is a key event in the [[World Match Racing Tour]] calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the [[International Sailing Federation]]. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a nine-event calendar which crosses three continents during the series. Points accrued during the Danish Open contribute directly to the World Match Racing Tour championship with the winner of the season finale at the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia claiming the ultimate match racing title ISAF World Match Racing Champion.\n\nThere are two small stadiums: [[Nex\u00f8 Stadion]], in [[Nex\u00f8]], where [[NB Bornholm]] [[association football]] club play; and the slightly larger multi-use stadium [[R\u00f8nne Stadion Nord]] in [[R\u00f8nne]], which serves the [[Non-FIFA international football|Bornholm national football team]], multi-section club most well known for [[sport of athletics|athletics]] IK Viking, and several local football clubs.

Occupying an area of {{convert|588.36|km2|sqmi}},<ref>[http://www.noegletal.dk Economy and Interior Ministry: Municipal Key Figures]</ref> the island had a total population of 39,572 on 1 January 2019.\n\nAmong Bornholm's chief industrial activities are [[dairy farming]] and [[arts and crafts]] industries such as [[glass production]] and [[pottery]] using locally worked [[clay]]. [[Tourism]] is also important during the summer months. The island is home to a large number of Denmark's [[Nordic round churches|round churches]].\n\nThe island is known as ''solskins\u00f8en'' (''Sunshine Island'') because of its weather and ''klippe\u00f8en'' (''Rock Island'') because of its geology, which consists of [[granite]], except along the southern coast. The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October. As a result of the climate, a local variety of the [[common fig]], known as ''Bornholm's Diamond'', can grow locally on the island.  The island's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of [[Denmark]], which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and [[deciduous]] forests (greatly affected by storms in the 1950s), farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.<ref>{{cite book| last = Blecher| first = Lone Thygesen|author2=George Blecher| title = Swedish Folktales & Legends| date = August 2004| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4575-6| pages = xvi }}</ref>\n\nStrategically located in the [[Baltic Sea]], Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. Usually it had been ruled by Denmark, but also by [[Sweden]] and [[L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck, Germany]]. The ruin of [[Hammershus]], at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest [[castle#History|medieval fortress]] in [[northern Europe]], testament to the importance of its location. This island and [[Ertholmene]] is what remains in Denmark of [[Sk\u00e5neland]] east of [[\u00d8resund]], having been surrendered to Sweden in [[Treaty of Roskilde|1658]] but with Bornholm after a local revolt later regained in [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|1660]].\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Bornholmsk dialect}}\n\nMany inhabitants speak the [[Bornholmsk dialect]], which is officially a [[Danish language#Dialects|dialect of Danish]].<ref>Peter Skautrup, ''Det Danske Sprogs Historie'', Gyldendal, 1968, vol. 4, p. 105ff. (Danish)</ref> Bornholmsk retains three [[grammatical gender]]s, like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]]. Its [[phonology]] includes [[archaism]]s (unstressed {{IPA|[a]}} and internal {{IPA|[d\u0325, \u0261\u030a]}}, where other dialects have {{IPA|[\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[\u00f0\u031e, \u028a / \u026a]}}) and innovations ({{IPA|[t\u0255, d\u029d]}} for {{IPA|[k\u02b0, \u0261\u030a]}} before and after front-tongue vowels). This makes the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish speakers. However, [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]] often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish. The [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] resembles the [[Scanian dialect]] spoken in nearby [[Scania]], the southernmost province of [[Sweden]].\n\n== Municipality ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float: right;\"\n|+Result of referendum 29 May 2001 on merger of municipalities with the county 1 January 2003\n|- align=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Municipality\n! colspan=\"2\"|Yes\n! colspan=\"2\"|No\n|-\n!Votes!!Percent!!Votes!!Percent\n|-\n|Allinge-Gudhjem\n!3590!!74!!1287!!26\n|-\n|Hasle\n!2886!!70!!1219!!30\n|-\n|Nex\u00f8\n!3218!!59!!2252!!41\n|-\n|R\u00f8nne\n!7754!!85!!1366!!15\n|-\n|Aakirkeby\n!3131!!74!!1118!!26\n|-\n|Total:27821\n!20579!!74!!7242!!26\n|}\n[[File:F\u00e6rgeforbindelser fra Bornholm.jpg|thumb|right|Ferry routes to and from Bornholm]] \n[[Image:Bornholms-Amt.png|thumb|180px|right|Bornholm and [[Christians\u00f8]] hundreds and 5 municipalities (1970\u20132002) in green colour and 21 municipalities before 1 April 1970]] \n[[File:Bornholm municipality numbered.svg|thumb|180px|right|Parishes in [[Church of Denmark]] numbered]]\n[[File:Flag of Denmark Bornholm.svg|right|thumb|180px|Unofficial [[flag of Bornholm]] (''the tourist flag'').]]\n[[File:Flag Denmark Bornholmsflaget.svg|right|thumb|180px|Unofficial flag of Bornholm.

It is the result of a merger of the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island ([[Allinge-Gudhjem Municipality|Allinge-Gudhjem]], [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Nex\u00f8]], [[R\u00f8nne]] and [[Aakirkeby]]) and the former [[Bornholm County]]. Bornholm Regional Municipality was also a county in its own right during its first four years from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2006. From 1 January 2007 all counties were abolished, and Bornholm became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]] whose main responsibility is the health service. The municipality still retains its name Bornholm ''Regional'' Municipality. The island had 21 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 15 parishes. In addition to supervising parish municipalities, which was the responsibility of the counties in ''all'' of Denmark, the market town municipalities of Bornholm were supervised by Bornholm County as well and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, R\u00f8nne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. The question on the [[ballot]] was, \"Do you want the six municipal entities of Bornholm to be joined to form one municipal entity as of 1 January 2003?\" 73.9% voted in favour. The lowest percentage for the merger was in [[Nex\u00f8]] municipality (966 more people voting \"Yes\" than \"No\"), whose mayor, Annelise Molin, a Social Democrat, spoke out against the merger. It was required that each municipality had more \"Yes\" votes than \"No\" votes. Otherwise the merger would have to be abandoned altogether. The six municipal entities had 122 councillors (of which county clls were 15) and the new regional municipality would have 27 councillors from the start. They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018 ([[2017 Danish local elections|election November 2017]]). The merger was approved in a law by the [[Folketing]] 19 March 2002, transferring the tasks of the abolished county and old municipalities to the new ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. The first regional mayor in the first three years from 2003 until 2005 was Thomas Thors (born 28 July 1949), a physician and member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and previously the last mayor of R\u00f8nne Municipality for five years from 1998 until 2002. Bjarne Kristiansen, who was the last mayor of [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]] 2\u00bd years from the summer of 2000 until 2002, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor for four years from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2007, Bornholm became a part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]]. From January 1, 2010 the mayor has been Winni Grosb\u00f8ll, a high school teacher and a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokratiet'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFerry services connect R\u00f8nne to [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie]] ([[Poland]]), [[Sassnitz]] ([[Germany]]), [[K\u00f8ge]], {{convert|45|km|abbr=off}} by road ({{convert|34|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}} as the crow flies) south of Copenhagen, [[Denmark]]; the destination to K\u00f8ge replaced the nighttime route directly to and from Copenhagen (for both cargo and passengers) from 1 October 2004; and [[HSC Leonora Christina|catamaran]] services to [[Ystad]] ([[Sweden]]). [[Simrishamn]] ([[Sweden]]) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular [[catamaran]] services between [[Nex\u00f8]] and the Polish ports of [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], [[\u0141eba]] and [[Ustka]]. There are direct bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also flights from [[Bornholm Airport]] to Copenhagen and other locations.\n\nBecause of its remote location Bornholm Regional Municipality has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], and is its own employment region, and also performs other tasks normally carried out by the regions in the rest of Denmark. In some respects the municipality forms a region of its own.\n\nBornholm Regional Municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 in the nationwide [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|Municipal Reform of 2007]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\nThe larger towns on the island are located on the coast and have harbours. There is however one exception, centrally placed [[Aakirkeby]], which was also the name of the municipality from 1970 until 2002, which did, however, include the harbor, Boderne, {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} to the south. The largest town is [[R\u00f8nne]], the seat, in the southwest. The other main towns (clockwise round the island) are [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Allinge-Sandvig]], [[Gudhjem]], [[Svaneke]] and [[Nex\u00f8]]. Monday morning 22 September 2014 it was documented by ''Folkeregistret'' in the municipality that the number of people living in the municipality that day were 39,922, the lowest number in over 100 years.<ref name=40k>[http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE7049169/der-bor-nu-under-40000-pa-bornholm/ Der bor nu under 40.000 p\u00e5 Bornholm]. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 25 September 2014.</ref>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, [[Statistics Denmark]] gave the populations as follows:<ref>[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&PLanguage=1 \"BY1: Population 1st January, by urban area, age, and gender\"] database from [[Statistics Denmark]].

It was originally administratively part of the province of [[Scania]] and was administered by the [[Scanian Law]] after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the [[Archbishop of Lund|See of Lund]] and the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish crown]] culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was ''[[Gamleborg]]'' which was replaced by ''[[Lilleborg, Bornholm|Lilleborg]]'', built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four [[Hundred (country subdivision)|herreder]] (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, [[Hammershus]]. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.\n\n===Modern===\nBornholm was pawned to [[L\u00fcbeck]] for 50 years starting in 1525. Its first militia, [[Bornholms Milits]], was formed in 1624.\n[[File:Bornholm-arsdale-windmill.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|An 1877<ref name=Museum>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/sekundaer-menu/forside.aspx |title=Bornholm Museum |access-date=20 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221145429/http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/sekundaer-menu/forside.aspx |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> windmill at [[Aarsdale|\u00c5rsdale]]]]\n\nSwedish forces conquered the island in 1645, but returned the island to Denmark in the following peace settlement. After the war in 1658, Denmark ceded the island to Sweden under the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] along with the rest of the [[Sk\u00e5neland]], [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] and [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], and it was occupied by Swedish forces.\n\nA revolt broke out the same year, culminating in Villum Clausen's shooting of the Swedish commander [[Johan Printzensk\u00f6ld]] on 8 December 1658.<ref name=Museum/> Following the revolt, a deputation of islanders presented the island as a gift to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] on the condition that the island would never be ceded again. This status was confirmed in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660.\n\n[[Swedes]], notably from [[Sm\u00e5land]] and Scania, emigrated to the island during the 19th century, seeking work and better conditions. Most of the migrants did not remain.\n[[File:R\u00f8nne.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|[[R\u00f8nne]], Bornholm.]]\n\nBornholm also attracted many famous artists at the beginning of the 20th century, forming a group now known as the [[Bornholm school of painters]].

The island's perfect central position in the [[Baltic Sea]] meant that it was an important \"natural fortress\" between [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries, which had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.\n\nOn 22 August 1943 a [[V-1 flying bomb]] (numbered V83, probably launched from a [[Heinkel He 111]]) crashed on Bornholm during a test \u2013 the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen.

The Germans sent several telegrams to Copenhagen requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the Western Allied forces instead of the Soviets. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in [[R\u00f8nne]] and [[Nex\u00f8]] and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7\u20138 May 1945.

This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, US troops in particular.<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf Vojtech Mastny, \"NATO in the Beholder\u2019s Eye: Soviet Perceptions and Policies, 1949\u201356\".

This cable is capable of delivering all the electrical energy consumed on Bornholm. However Bornholm also generates its own electricity at small thermal power plants and especially [[wind turbine]]s.\n\nBornholm is also home to a large internationally funded demonstration project to test the viability of novel energy market mechanisms to regulate energy networks with a high prevalence of renewables (such as wind turbines and photovoltaics). 50% of the project is EU-funded, with the remainder coming mainly from large corporations. See http://www.eu-ecogrid.net/ecogrid-eu for more.\n\n==Climate==\nBornholm has an [[oceanic climate]] relatively similar to southern Sweden and mainland Denmark, whose summer highs and winter lows are heavily moderated by its maritime and isolated position. Even though heat is rare, the climate is sunny during summers and rainfall is generally sparse for a climate of this type. The winter (November\u2013December) 2010 \u2013 (January\u2013April) 2011 was exceptionally extreme with snow depth reaching at least 146 [[centimeter|cm]], 2 inches short of 5 [[foot (unit)|feet]] ([[snowdrift]]s 6 [[Metre|meters]], almost 20 feet) the highest in Northern Europe. Military assistance was needed. The [[Danish Meteorological Institute|DMI]] estimated the weight of snow to be 100 [[million]] [[ton]].  2013 was a cold year, with only June, July, and August being warm.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Bornholm (1971\u20132000)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 8.9\n| Feb record high C = 9.7\n| Mar record high C = 15.1\n| Apr record high C = 26.6\n| May record high C = 27.2\n| Jun record high C = 31.7\n| Jul record high C = 31.9\n| Aug record high C = 32.0\n| Sep record high C = 27.9\n| Oct record high C = 20.2\n| Nov record high C = 15.7\n| Dec record high C = 11.0\n|year record high C = 32.0\n| Jan high C = 2.7\n| Feb high C = 2.4\n| Mar high C = 4.5\n| Apr high C = 8.9\n| May high C = 14.5\n| Jun high C = 17.9\n| Jul high C = 20.1\n| Aug high C = 20.5\n| Sep high C = 16.4\n| Oct high C = 11.9\n| Nov high C = 7.3\n| Dec high C = 4.4\n|year high C = 10.9\n| Jan mean C = 0.9\n| Feb mean C = 0.4\n| Mar mean C = 2.1\n| Apr mean C = 5.5\n| May mean C = 10.5\n| Jun mean C = 14.3\n| Jul mean C = 16.8\n| Aug mean C = 17.0\n| Sep mean C = 13.4\n| Oct mean C = 9.5\n| Nov mean C = 5.4\n| Dec mean C = 2.6\n|year mean C = 8.2\n| Jan low C = \u22121.1\n| Feb low C = \u22121.7\n| Mar low C = \u22120.4\n| Apr low C = 2.1\n| May low C = 6.6\n| Jun low C = 10.7\n| Jul low C = 13.3\n| Aug low C = 13.4\n| Sep low C = 10.5\n| Oct low C = 6.9\n| Nov low C = 3.2\n| Dec low C = 0.5\n|year low C = 5.3\n| Jan record low C = -15.7\n| Feb record low C = -17.7\n| Mar record low C = -16.1\n| Apr record low C = -7.0\n| May record low C = -3.0\n| Jun record low C = -0.2\n| Jul record low C = 4.0\n| Aug record low C = 5.4\n| Sep record low C = -0.2\n| Oct record low C = -5.7\n| Nov record low C = -10.1\n| Dec record low C = -14.1\n|year record low C = -17.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 40.2\n| Feb precipitation mm = 22.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 30.6\n| Apr precipitation mm = 30.2\n| May precipitation mm = 31.9\n| Jun precipitation mm = 44.2\n| Jul precipitation mm = 47.1\n| Aug precipitation mm = 41.4\n| Sep precipitation mm = 55.5\n| Oct precipitation mm = 50.2\n| Nov precipitation mm = 52.1\n| Dec precipitation mm = 42.4\n|year precipitation mm = 488.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 16.5\n| Feb precipitation days = 12.9\n| Mar precipitation days = 13.7\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.2\n| May precipitation days = 10.0\n| Jun precipitation days = 11.0\n| Jul precipitation days = 10.6\n| Aug precipitation days = 10.8\n| Sep precipitation days = 13.2\n| Oct precipitation days = 14.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 16.7\n| Dec precipitation days = 16.1\n|year precipitation days = 157.3\n| Jan snow days = 5.6\n| Feb snow days = 5.3\n| Mar snow days = 4.0\n| Apr snow days = 0.9\n| May snow days = 0.1\n| Jun snow days = 0.0\n| Jul snow days = 0.0\n| Aug snow days = 0.0\n| Sep snow days = 0.0\n| Oct snow days = 0.0\n| Nov snow days = 1.8\n| Dec snow days = 3.4\n|year snow days = 21.2\n| Jan sun = 35\n| Feb sun = 53\n| Mar sun = 112\n| Apr sun = 190\n| May sun = 284\n| Jun sun = 266\n| Jul sun = 276\n| Aug sun = 252\n| Sep sun = 155\n| Oct sun = 102\n| Nov sun = 46\n| Dec sun = 31\n|year sun = 1809\n|source 1 = Danish Meteorological Institute<ref name = DMI1>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/Rapporter/TR/2002/tr02-12.pdf\n| title = Danish Climatological Normals 1971\u20132000 for selected stations\n| publisher = [[Danish Meteorological Institute]]\n| accessdate = 17 November 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Sports ==\nBornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water-based sports. Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical yachts are raced in one-on-one events on the water. The [[Danish Open (yachting)|Danish Open]] event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of R\u00f8nne on the western coast of Bornholm. The five-day Danish Open is a key event in the [[World Match Racing Tour]] calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the [[International Sailing Federation]]. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a nine-event calendar which crosses three continents during the series.
