The original show featured Crusty The Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T.

The control system dubbed \"Cyberstar\" was re-designed from the ground up and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E. Cheese costume character or an animatronic in a futuristic light stage with large television monitors. \n\nIn July 2012, the longstanding rat mascot was rebranded, changing to a slimmer rock star mouse who plays electric guitar. Voice actor [[Duncan Brannan]], who for 19 years had characterized Chuck E.

The children must dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the children that participated. Chuck comes out every hour on the half hour. The songs that he and the children dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as \"[[If You're Happy and You Know It]]\" and \"[[Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chuck E.

Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child's feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child's autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication and both control and support are balanced. Research{{vague|date=March 2017}} shows that this style is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style.\n\n;Authoritarian parenting styles\n:Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations that are strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and insure future obedience.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> This parenting style is strongly associated with [[corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]] and \"Because I said so\" is a typical response to a child's question of authority. This type of parenting is seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In 1983 Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, more moody and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases these children also demonstrated passive hostility.\n\n;Permissive parenting\n:Permissive, or indulgent, parenting is more popular in middle-class than in working-class families{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In these settings, a child's freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents tend to rely mostly on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, so there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this style of parenting. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever the child wants at the time.

Parenting takes a lot of skill and patience and is a constant work on growth. The cognitive potential, social skills, and behavioral functioning a child acquires during the early years are fundamentally dependent on the quality of their interactions with their parents.\n\nCanadian Council on Learning says that children benefit most (avoids poor developmental outcomes) when their parents:<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120914112822/http://www.ccl-cca.ca/pdfs/LessonsInLearning/Dec-13-07-Parenting-styles.pdf{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\n# Communicate truthfully about events or discussions that have happened, because authenticity from parents who explain and help their children understand what happens and how they are involved if they are without giving defining rules.

But those who come from a negative/vulnerable environment might tend to pass on what they suffered onto their families oppressed by their own experiences, those who have inaccurate beliefs or poorer understanding of developmental milestones only engage in the way they know which may result in problematic parenting.

Rather than directly informing the child what they should do, the parent instead might tell a story of a similar situation or scenario.

This form of teasing utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. It can teach children values by establishing expectations and encouraging the child to meet them via playful jokes and/or idle threats. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that alarm creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.<ref>Brown, P. (2002).

This form of guidance fosters \u201crespect\u201d not only for the child's family members but also to the community as a whole. On this run, the community uses humor and laughter with each other, without directly including the child\u2014who may not wish to get up early and run\u2014to promote the child's motivation to participate and become an active member of the community.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" /> To modify children's behavior in a nonverbal manner, parents also promote inclusion in the morning runs by placing their child in the snow and having them stay longer if they protest; this is done within a context of warmth, laughter, and community, to help incorporate the child into the practice.<ref name=\"Source 1996\" />\n\nA tool parents use in Indigenous American cultures is to [[Child integration|incorporate children]] into everyday life, including adult activities, to pass on the parents\u2019 knowledge by allowing the child to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn through observation]].

An infant's only form of communication is crying, and attentive parents will begin to recognize different types of [[crying]] which represent different needs such as hunger, discomfort, boredom, or loneliness. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours which is disruptive to adult [[Sleep cycle#Stages of sleep|sleep cycles]]. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling and caressing. Gentle rocking back and forth often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or a [[pacifier]]. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. [[Breastfeeding]] is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations.<ref name=\"AAP_Policy\">{{cite journal | title=Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk | author=Gartner LM |author2=Morton J |author3=Lawrence RA |author4=Naylor AJ |author5=O'Hare D |author6=Schanler RJ |author7=Eidelman AI | journal=Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue=2 |date=February 2005 | pages=496\u2013506 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2491 | pmid=15687461|display-authors=etal}}</ref> If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative.

Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they often go together. Attachments develop immediately and a lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted capacity for attachment could potentially do serious damage to a child's health and well-being. Physically, one may not see symptoms or indications of a disorder but the child may be emotionally affected. Studies show that children with secure attachment have the ability to form successful relationships, express themselves on an interpersonal basis and have higher self-esteem {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the [[toddler]] to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette such as being polite and taking turns.<ref>https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/manners/teaching-kids-to-mind-their-manners/</ref>[[File:Parenting.JPG|thumb|A father and daughter in [[Trivandrum]], [[India]]|left]]Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and eager to explore it. They seek greater independence and responsibility and may become frustrated when things do not go the way they want or expect. [[Tantrum]]s begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the 'Terrible Twos'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safekids.co.uk/terrible-twos-explained.html |title=The Terrible Twos Explained - Safe Kids (UK) |publisher=Safe Kids |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> Tantrums are often caused by the child's frustration over the particular situation, sometimes simply not being able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child's responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often behave badly with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors, giving threats or punishments is not helpful and will only make the situation worse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pitman|first=Teresa|title=Toddler Frustration|url=http://www.todaysparent.com/toddler/toddler-behaviour/toddler-frustration|publisher=Todaysparent|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>  Research groups led by [[Daniel Schechter]], Alytia Levendosky, and others have shown that parents with histories of maltreatment and violence exposure often have difficulty helping their toddlers and preschool-age children with these very same emotionally dysregulated behaviors, which can remind traumatized parents of their adverse experiences and associated mental states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schechter |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Willheim |first2=Erica |last3=Hinojosa |first3=Claudia |last4=Scholfield-Kleinman |first4=Kimberly |last5=Turner |first5=J.

They are able to reason and can make their own decisions given hypothetical situations. Young children demand constant attention, but will learn how to deal with boredom and be able to play independently. They also enjoy helping and feeling useful and able. Parents may assist their child by encouraging social interactions and modelling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties.

Parenting styles in this area diverge greatly at this stage with some parents becoming heavily involved in arranging organized activities and early learning programs. Other parents choose to let the child develop with few organized activities.\n\nChildren begin to learn responsibility, and consequences of their actions, with parental assistance. Some parents provide a small allowance that increases with age to help teach children the value of money and how to be responsible with it.\n\nParents who are consistent and fair with their [[child discipline|discipline]], who openly communicate and offer explanations to their children, and who do not neglect the needs of their children in some way often find they have fewer problems with their children as they mature.\n\n===Adolescents===\n\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{Main|Adolescence}}\nParents often feel isolated and alone in parenting [[Adolescence|adolescents]].<ref>[https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ Sharenting & Oversharenting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816042806/https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ |date=16 August 2016 }}</ref> Adolescence can be a time of high [[risk]] for children, where new-found freedoms can result in decisions that drastically open up or close off life opportunities.

Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with \"[[rebellious]]\" [[teenager]]s who consistently push the limits. In order to prevent these issues, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved by planning and taking part in fun activities together, keeping promises made to the children, spending time with them, not reminding kids about their past mistakes and listening to and talking to them.\n\nWhen a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping the children build a strong foundation will help them resist negative peer pressure.\n\n===Adults===\nParenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood. Parenting can be a lifelong process.\n\nParents may provide financial support to their adult children, which can also include providing an inheritance after death. The life perspective and wisdom given by a parent can benefit their adult children in their own lives. Becoming a [[grandparent]] is another milestone and has many similarities with parenting.\n\nRoles can be reversed in some ways when adult children become [[caregivers]] to their elderly parents.\n\n==Assistance==\n{{Main|Child care}}\nParents may receive assistance with caring for their children through child care programs.\n\n==Childbearing and happiness==\nData from the [[British Household Panel Survey]] and the German [[Socio-Economic Panel]] suggests that having up to two children increases happiness in the years around the birth, and mostly so for those who have postponed childbearing.

Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child's feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child's autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication and both control and support are balanced. Research{{vague|date=March 2017}} shows that this style is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style.\n\n;Authoritarian parenting styles\n:Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations that are strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and insure future obedience.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule.<ref name=\"DOI_10.1177/0192513X08322933\" /> This parenting style is strongly associated with [[corporal punishment]], such as [[spanking]] and \"Because I said so\" is a typical response to a child's question of authority. This type of parenting is seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In 1983 Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, more moody and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases these children also demonstrated passive hostility.\n\n;Permissive parenting\n:Permissive, or indulgent, parenting is more popular in middle-class than in working-class families{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}. In these settings, a child's freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents tend to rely mostly on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, so there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this style of parenting. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever the child wants at the time. Children of permissive parents are generally happy but sometimes show low levels of self-control and self-reliance because they lack structure at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style|title=permissive parenting|last=|first=|date=|website=MSU.EDU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n;Uninvolved parenting\n:An uninvolved or neglectful parenting style is when parents are often emotionally or physically absent.<ref name=\"DOI:10.1080/01494920802010140\" /> They have little to no expectation of the child and regularly have no communication.

With authoritarian and permissive parenting on opposite sides of the spectrum, most conventional and modern models of parenting fall somewhere in between. Parenting strategies, as well as behaviors and ideals of what parents expect, (whether communicated verbally and/or non-verbally) can also play a significant role in a child's development.\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Father and child.jpg|thumb|A father and son]]\nA parenting practice is a specific behavior that a parent uses in raising a child.<ref name=Spera/> For example, a common parent practice intended to promote academic success is reading books to the child.

Parenting takes a lot of skill and patience and is a constant work on growth. The cognitive potential, social skills, and behavioral functioning a child acquires during the early years are fundamentally dependent on the quality of their interactions with their parents.\n\nCanadian Council on Learning says that children benefit most (avoids poor developmental outcomes) when their parents:<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120914112822/http://www.ccl-cca.ca/pdfs/LessonsInLearning/Dec-13-07-Parenting-styles.pdf{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\n# Communicate truthfully about events or discussions that have happened, because authenticity from parents who explain and help their children understand what happens and how they are involved if they are without giving defining rules.

But those who come from a negative/vulnerable environment might tend to pass on what they suffered onto their families oppressed by their own experiences, those who have inaccurate beliefs or poorer understanding of developmental milestones only engage in the way they know which may result in problematic parenting.

This form of teasing utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. It can teach children values by establishing expectations and encouraging the child to meet them via playful jokes and/or idle threats. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that alarm creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.<ref>Brown, P. (2002).

A newborn's basic needs are food, sleep, comfort and cleaning which the parent provides. An infant's only form of communication is crying, and attentive parents will begin to recognize different types of [[crying]] which represent different needs such as hunger, discomfort, boredom, or loneliness. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours which is disruptive to adult [[Sleep cycle#Stages of sleep|sleep cycles]]. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling and caressing. Gentle rocking back and forth often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or a [[pacifier]]. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. [[Breastfeeding]] is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations.<ref name=\"AAP_Policy\">{{cite journal | title=Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk | author=Gartner LM |author2=Morton J |author3=Lawrence RA |author4=Naylor AJ |author5=O'Hare D |author6=Schanler RJ |author7=Eidelman AI | journal=Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue=2 |date=February 2005 | pages=496\u2013506 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2491 | pmid=15687461|display-authors=etal}}</ref> If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative.

Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they often go together. Attachments develop immediately and a lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted capacity for attachment could potentially do serious damage to a child's health and well-being. Physically, one may not see symptoms or indications of a disorder but the child may be emotionally affected. Studies show that children with secure attachment have the ability to form successful relationships, express themselves on an interpersonal basis and have higher self-esteem {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is usual for the [[toddler]] to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette such as being polite and taking turns.<ref>https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/manners/teaching-kids-to-mind-their-manners/</ref>[[File:Parenting.JPG|thumb|A father and daughter in [[Trivandrum]], [[India]]|left]]Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and eager to explore it. They seek greater independence and responsibility and may become frustrated when things do not go the way they want or expect. [[Tantrum]]s begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the 'Terrible Twos'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safekids.co.uk/terrible-twos-explained.html |title=The Terrible Twos Explained - Safe Kids (UK) |publisher=Safe Kids |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> Tantrums are often caused by the child's frustration over the particular situation, sometimes simply not being able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child's responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience; trial and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them, in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often behave badly with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors, giving threats or punishments is not helpful and will only make the situation worse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pitman|first=Teresa|title=Toddler Frustration|url=http://www.todaysparent.com/toddler/toddler-behaviour/toddler-frustration|publisher=Todaysparent|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>  Research groups led by [[Daniel Schechter]], Alytia Levendosky, and others have shown that parents with histories of maltreatment and violence exposure often have difficulty helping their toddlers and preschool-age children with these very same emotionally dysregulated behaviors, which can remind traumatized parents of their adverse experiences and associated mental states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schechter |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Willheim |first2=Erica |last3=Hinojosa |first3=Claudia |last4=Scholfield-Kleinman |first4=Kimberly |last5=Turner |first5=J.

They are able to reason and can make their own decisions given hypothetical situations. Young children demand constant attention, but will learn how to deal with boredom and be able to play independently. They also enjoy helping and feeling useful and able. Parents may assist their child by encouraging social interactions and modelling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties. Parents who observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play have the opportunity to glimpse into their children's world, learn to communicate more effectively with their children and are given another setting to offer gentle, nurturing guidance.<ref name=AAP>{{cite web|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds |url=http://www.wcss.wa.edu.au/pdf/importanceoftheplay_AAP.pdf |author=Kenneth R.

Parenting styles in this area diverge greatly at this stage with some parents becoming heavily involved in arranging organized activities and early learning programs. Other parents choose to let the child develop with few organized activities.\n\nChildren begin to learn responsibility, and consequences of their actions, with parental assistance. Some parents provide a small allowance that increases with age to help teach children the value of money and how to be responsible with it.\n\nParents who are consistent and fair with their [[child discipline|discipline]], who openly communicate and offer explanations to their children, and who do not neglect the needs of their children in some way often find they have fewer problems with their children as they mature.\n\n===Adolescents===\n\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{Main|Adolescence}}\nParents often feel isolated and alone in parenting [[Adolescence|adolescents]].<ref>[https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ Sharenting & Oversharenting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816042806/https://www.techspurs.com/sharenting/ |date=16 August 2016 }}</ref> Adolescence can be a time of high [[risk]] for children, where new-found freedoms can result in decisions that drastically open up or close off life opportunities.

Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with \"[[rebellious]]\" [[teenager]]s who consistently push the limits. In order to prevent these issues, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved by planning and taking part in fun activities together, keeping promises made to the children, spending time with them, not reminding kids about their past mistakes and listening to and talking to them.\n\nWhen a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping the children build a strong foundation will help them resist negative peer pressure.\n\n===Adults===\nParenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child's life well beyond the adolescent years and continues into middle and later adulthood. Parenting can be a lifelong process.\n\nParents may provide financial support to their adult children, which can also include providing an inheritance after death. The life perspective and wisdom given by a parent can benefit their adult children in their own lives. Becoming a [[grandparent]] is another milestone and has many similarities with parenting.\n\nRoles can be reversed in some ways when adult children become [[caregivers]] to their elderly parents.\n\n==Assistance==\n{{Main|Child care}}\nParents may receive assistance with caring for their children through child care programs.\n\n==Childbearing and happiness==\nData from the [[British Household Panel Survey]] and the German [[Socio-Economic Panel]] suggests that having up to two children increases happiness in the years around the birth, and mostly so for those who have postponed childbearing.

These included ''The Ants'' (1962), ''Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen'' (1971), and ''Schreber's Nervous Illness'' (1972). She also wrote television plays for the BBC, including ''The After Dinner Joke'' (1978) and ''Crimes'' (1982).

It was her first stage play and \"her first major theatrical endeavour\"; it was produced in London the same year.<ref name=britannica/> \n\nShe served as resident dramatist at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from 1974 to 1975, and later began collaboration with theatre companies such as [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]] and [[Monstrous Regiment Theatre Company|Monstrous Regiment]] (a [[feminist theatre]] collective). Both used an extended workshop period in their development of new plays. Churchill continues to use an [[improvisation]]al workshop period in developing a number of her plays. During this period, she also wrote ''Objections to Sex and Violence'' (1974).<ref name=britannica/>\n\nHer first play to receive wide notice was ''[[Cloud Nine (play)|Cloud Nine]]'' (1979), \"a farce about sexual politics\", set partly in a British overseas colony during the [[Victorian era]]. It explores the effects of the [[colonialist]]/[[imperialist]] mindset on intimate personal relationships, and uses cross-gender casting for comic and instructive effect.

Half the action takes place at a celebratory dinner where Marlene mixes with historical, iconic and fictional women who have achieved great stature in a \"man's world\", but always at great cost. The other half of the play, set a year in the past, focuses on Marlene's family, where the true cost of her \"successful\" life becomes poignantly and frighteningly apparent. In ''Top Girls,'' Churchill made a note to describe the layout. She used the forward dash signal (/) to demonstrate a person interrupting the person speaking.

From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]].  In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized.  Allen County is one of the 33 counties established by the first territorial legislature in August 1855, six years before Kansas statehood in 1861. It was named in honor of [[William Allen (governor)|William Allen]], a United States senator from [[Ohio]].  At the time of its creation, Charles Passmore was appointed probate judge; B.W. Cowden and Barnett Owen were appointed county commissioners, and William Godfrey was appointed sheriff. The appointments were temporary until the general election in 1857. The four men were authorized to appoint the county clerk and treasurer thus completing the county organization.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History of Allen County, Kansas|url = http://www.genealogytrails.com/kan/allen/history.html|website = www.genealogytrails.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref>\n\nRichard J. Fuqua and his family are considered the first white settlers in the county, arriving in the valley of the [[Neosho River]] January 1855.  Fuqua established a post for trading with the neighboring Indian tribes which became quite popular with the Sac and Fox Indians. B.W. Cowden and H.D. Parsons arrived in March of the same year and selected claims in the valley of the Neosho River, near the mouth of Elm Creek. The next settlement was made near the mouth of Deer Creek (so named for the abundance of deer in the area) by Major James Parsons, and his two sons, Jesse and James, and a Mr. Duncan. The population grew rapidly through the spring and summer of 1855, most of it located on or near the Neosho River.\n\nMany of the early settlers were pro-slavery, but few slaves were actually brought into the county. The anti-slavery population expressed such antipathy toward their pro-slavery neighbors that slaves within the county there were either freed or taken elsewhere in Kansas by their masters. Immigration continued during the summer and fall of 1856, though in reduced numbers.<ref name=\"Allen County, Part 1\">{{Cite web|title = Allen County, Part 1|url = http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/allen/allen-co-p1.html|website = www.kancoll.org|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe first town and [[county seat]] was [[Cofachique, Kansas|Cofachique]].  In the spring of 1855 pro-slavery settlers from [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]] laid out the town in a hilly area east of the Neosho River and south of the mouth of Elm Creek. The territorial legislature passed an act in July 1855 incorporating the Cofachique Town Association. It was the only town in Allen County for nearly two years and as such was quite successful; but in 1857 other towns were constructed and Cofachique began to decline almost immediately. One of the reasons for decline was accessibility, the other was a lack of good well water. Another possible contribution to the town's decline involved tensions between the pro and anti-slavery settlers. With the development of neighboring towns [[Humboldt, Kansas|Humboldt]] and [[Iola, Kansas|Iola]] the town of Cofachique all but disappeared by 1859.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the State of Kansas: Containing a Full Account of Its Growth from an Uninhabited Territory to a Wealthy and Important State...

It operated until a replacement jail house was opened in 1959. Since that time the original jail has been run as a [[museum]].<ref>Pankratz, Richard D.

Periods of drought beginning as early as 1854 had plagued all of Kansas and though 1859 had seen a reprieve, by the end of 1859 and into 1860 the drought worsened. The St. Laurence newspaper reported: \"No rain, no snow, and much open, thawing, mild weather, alternated with sharp, though brief [cold] snaps. . . .\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Dust Storms: Part One, 1850-1860         - Kansas Historical Society|url = https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-dust-storms-part-one-1850-1860/13024|website = www.kshs.org|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref> Most of the people who had moved to the county in the previous two years were still trying to establish their farms.

In extent it is twenty-one miles from north to south and twenty-four miles from east to west.\n\n===Geographic features===\nThe general surface of the country is slightly rolling, though much more level than the greater portion of eastern Kansas.  The soil is fertile and highly productive.  The bottom lands along the streams average one and one-half miles in width, and comprise one-tenth the area of the county.  The remainder is the gently rolling or level upland prairie.  The principal varieties of trees native to the county are black walnut, hickory, cottonwood, oak, hackberry and elm.<ref name=\"Allen County, Part 1\"/>\n\nThe main water course is the [[Neosho River]], which flows through the western part of the county from north to south.  Its tributaries are Indian, Martin's, Deer, Elm, and other small creeks.  The [[Marmaton River]] rises east of the center of the county, and flows through the southeastern part of the county.  The [[Little Osage River]] rises not far from the head of the Marmaton and flows northeast.  Its tributaries are Middle Creek on the north and the South Fork on the south.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. ...|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o8X5krq3fP8C|publisher = Standard Publishing Company|date = 1912-01-01|first = Frank Wilson|last = Blackmar}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Anderson County, Kansas|Anderson County]] (north)\n* [[Linn County, Kansas|Linn County]] (northeast)\n* [[Bourbon County, Kansas|Bourbon County]] (east)\n* [[Neosho County, Kansas|Neosho County]] (south)\n* [[Wilson County, Kansas|Wilson County]] (southwest)\n* [[Woodson County, Kansas|Woodson County]] (west)\n* [[Coffey County, Kansas|Coffey County]] (northwest)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 3082\n|1870= 7022\n|1880= 11303\n|1890= 13509\n|1900= 19507\n|1910= 27640\n|1920= 23509\n|1930= 21391\n|1940= 19874\n|1950= 18187\n|1960= 16369\n|1970= 15043\n|1980= 15654\n|1990= 14638\n|2000= 14385\n|2010= 13371\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=12444\n|estref=\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=U.S. Decennial Census |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ks190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

From the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]].  In 1762, after the [[French and Indian War]], France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized.  Allen County is one of the 33 counties established by the first territorial legislature in August 1855, six years before Kansas statehood in 1861. It was named in honor of [[William Allen (governor)|William Allen]], a United States senator from [[Ohio]].  At the time of its creation, Charles Passmore was appointed probate judge; B.W. Cowden and Barnett Owen were appointed county commissioners, and William Godfrey was appointed sheriff. The appointments were temporary until the general election in 1857. The four men were authorized to appoint the county clerk and treasurer thus completing the county organization.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History of Allen County, Kansas|url = http://www.genealogytrails.com/kan/allen/history.html|website = www.genealogytrails.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref>\n\nRichard J. Fuqua and his family are considered the first white settlers in the county, arriving in the valley of the [[Neosho River]] January 1855.  Fuqua established a post for trading with the neighboring Indian tribes which became quite popular with the Sac and Fox Indians. B.W. Cowden and H.D. Parsons arrived in March of the same year and selected claims in the valley of the Neosho River, near the mouth of Elm Creek. The next settlement was made near the mouth of Deer Creek (so named for the abundance of deer in the area) by Major James Parsons, and his two sons, Jesse and James, and a Mr. Duncan. The population grew rapidly through the spring and summer of 1855, most of it located on or near the Neosho River.\n\nMany of the early settlers were pro-slavery, but few slaves were actually brought into the county. The anti-slavery population expressed such antipathy toward their pro-slavery neighbors that slaves within the county there were either freed or taken elsewhere in Kansas by their masters. Immigration continued during the summer and fall of 1856, though in reduced numbers.<ref name=\"Allen County, Part 1\">{{Cite web|title = Allen County, Part 1|url = http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/allen/allen-co-p1.html|website = www.kancoll.org|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe first town and [[county seat]] was [[Cofachique, Kansas|Cofachique]].  In the spring of 1855 pro-slavery settlers from [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]] laid out the town in a hilly area east of the Neosho River and south of the mouth of Elm Creek. The territorial legislature passed an act in July 1855 incorporating the Cofachique Town Association. It was the only town in Allen County for nearly two years and as such was quite successful; but in 1857 other towns were constructed and Cofachique began to decline almost immediately. One of the reasons for decline was accessibility, the other was a lack of good well water. Another possible contribution to the town's decline involved tensions between the pro and anti-slavery settlers. With the development of neighboring towns [[Humboldt, Kansas|Humboldt]] and [[Iola, Kansas|Iola]] the town of Cofachique all but disappeared by 1859.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the State of Kansas: Containing a Full Account of Its Growth from an Uninhabited Territory to a Wealthy and Important State...

It operated until a replacement jail house was opened in 1959. Since that time the original jail has been run as a [[museum]].<ref>Pankratz, Richard D.

In extent it is twenty-one miles from north to south and twenty-four miles from east to west.\n\n===Geographic features===\nThe general surface of the country is slightly rolling, though much more level than the greater portion of eastern Kansas.  The soil is fertile and highly productive.  The bottom lands along the streams average one and one-half miles in width, and comprise one-tenth the area of the county.  The remainder is the gently rolling or level upland prairie.  The principal varieties of trees native to the county are black walnut, hickory, cottonwood, oak, hackberry and elm.<ref name=\"Allen County, Part 1\"/>\n\nThe main water course is the [[Neosho River]], which flows through the western part of the county from north to south.  Its tributaries are Indian, Martin's, Deer, Elm, and other small creeks.  The [[Marmaton River]] rises east of the center of the county, and flows through the southeastern part of the county.  The [[Little Osage River]] rises not far from the head of the Marmaton and flows northeast.  Its tributaries are Middle Creek on the north and the South Fork on the south.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. ...|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o8X5krq3fP8C|publisher = Standard Publishing Company|date = 1912-01-01|first = Frank Wilson|last = Blackmar}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Anderson County, Kansas|Anderson County]] (north)\n* [[Linn County, Kansas|Linn County]] (northeast)\n* [[Bourbon County, Kansas|Bourbon County]] (east)\n* [[Neosho County, Kansas|Neosho County]] (south)\n* [[Wilson County, Kansas|Wilson County]] (southwest)\n* [[Woodson County, Kansas|Woodson County]] (west)\n* [[Coffey County, Kansas|Coffey County]] (northwest)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 3082\n|1870= 7022\n|1880= 11303\n|1890= 13509\n|1900= 19507\n|1910= 27640\n|1920= 23509\n|1930= 21391\n|1940= 19874\n|1950= 18187\n|1960= 16369\n|1970= 15043\n|1980= 15654\n|1990= 14638\n|2000= 14385\n|2010= 13371\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=12444\n|estref=\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=U.S. Decennial Census |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ks190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The other route is [[U.S. Route 169]] which passes through western portions of the county and bypasses to the east of the cities of Iola, [[Bassett, Kansas|Bassett]], and [[Humboldt, Kansas|Humboldt]].  It connects to [[Chanute, Kansas|Chanute]] and eventually [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] in the south.  The segment between Iola and Chanute is a [[freeway]] with fully controlled access, although there is only one lane in each direction.  US-169 provides a direct route for traveling between [[Kansas City metropolitan area|Kansas City]] and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]].\n\n===Airports===\n* [[Allen County Airport]] (K88), public\n* Croisant Airport (7KS5), private\n* Ensminger Airport (74KS), private\n* National Airport, public\n* Womack Airport, public\n\n==Communities==\n[[File:Map of Allen Co, Ks, USA.png|thumb|280px|right|2005 [[Kansas Department of Transportation|KDOT]] Map of Allen County ([[:File:Kansas official transportation map legend.png|map legend]])]]\n\n===Cities===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Bassett, Kansas|Bassett]]\n* [[Elsmore, Kansas|Elsmore]]\n* [[Gas, Kansas|Gas]]\n* [[Humboldt, Kansas|Humboldt]]\n* [[Iola, Kansas|Iola]]\n* [[La Harpe, Kansas|La Harpe]]\n* [[Mildred, Kansas|Mildred]]\n* [[Moran, Kansas|Moran]]\n* [[Savonburg, Kansas|Savonburg]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n* [[Bayard, Kansas|Bayard]]\n* [[Carlyle, Kansas|Carlyle]]\n* [[Cofachique, Kansas|Cofachique]] (extinct town)\n* [[Geneva, Kansas|Geneva]]\n* [[Petrolia, Kansas|Petrolia]]\n\n===Townships===\nAllen County is divided into twelve [[Civil township|townships]].

Stylish for Firefox can additionally style the skin of the browser itself, but the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version does not support this because the user interface is built in native Android code. The styles are applied only to the targets specified. Individual user styles can be enabled or disabled without having to restart the browser.\n\nUser styles are added to the CSS rules provided by the site, but can also override the site's styling (often requiring the <code>!important</code> keyword for each replacement rule). The most common uses are [[ad blocking]], applying a new color scheme, and eliminating unwanted page elements.<ref>\"[http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/61745 Make the whole Web look better with Stylish],\" Nathan Willis, Mon 7 May 2007.</ref>\n\nThere are three classes of user styles. Site styles change the appearance of a particular web site. Global styles change the appearance of all web sites. App styles change the appearance of the Firefox user interface, only supported on Firefox. It is similar to the <code>userChrome.css</code> CSS file used by Firefox and Mozilla-based browsers.\n\n==Privacy issues==\n\nSince January 2017, following the sale of Stylish to Israeli company [[SimilarWeb]], the extension has contained tracking functions that sends information on all visited URLs and HTTP requests, and information contained on search engine results pages, to SimilarWeb servers. In July 2018, after these issues were publicized by a software engineer, Stylish was pulled from both the [[Chrome Web Store]] and [[Mozilla Add-ons]], as well as being automatically uninstalled for all existing users.<ref name=\"ars-stylish-banned\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/stylish-extension-with-2m-downloads-banished-for-tracking-every-site-visit/|title=\u201cStylish\u201d extension with 2M downloads banned for tracking every site visit|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=2018-07-06|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|accessdate=2018-07-06|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/use-this-popular-chrome-firefox-add-on-google-mozilla-just-banished-it/|title=Use this popular Chrome, Firefox browser add-on?

A [[Chrome extension]] followed in 2010,<ref>{{cite web |title=Stylish for Google Chrome |last=Barnabe |first=Jason |url=https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/17761/stylish-for-google-chrome |website=Userstyles.org |date=March 1, 2010}}</ref> which was released for [[Blink (web engine)|Blink]]-based [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 15 in 2013<ref>{{cite url |title=Stylish for Chrome and Opera (15+) 1.2b |last=Barnabe |first=Jason |date=July 3, 2013 |url=https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/36378/stylish-for-chrome-and-opera-15-1-2b |website=Userstyles.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Stylish extension - Opera add-ons |publisher=Opera Software ASA |url=https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylish/?display=en&page=3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173412/https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylish/?display=en&page=3#c686335 |archive-date=April 25, 2013 |url-status=dead\n |postscript = . <br/> The oldest comment is dated July 26, 2013.\n}}</ref> and as a Firefox [[Features of Firefox#Electrolysis and WebExtensions|WebExtension]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=New version for Firefox |date=November 2, 2017 |website=userstyles.org |url=https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/60992/new-version-for-firefox |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226101549/https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/60992/new-version-for-firefox |archive-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=Stylish - Custom themes for any website Version History\n |website=Firefox Add-ons\n |publisher=Mozilla |url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/versions/\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512101058/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/versions/\n |archive-date=May 12, 2018\n |url-status=dead\n |postscript  = . <br/> Version 3.0.1 is the first Stylish for Firefox WebExtension release; version 2.1.1 is the last Stylish XUL/XPCOM add-on release.\n}}</ref> Similar extensions for [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]<ref name=\"stylish-safari\">{{cite web |title=Stylish for Safari |last=Sobolev |first=Vladimir |url=http://sobolev.us/stylish/ }}</ref> and for [[Presto (browser engine)|Presto]]-based Opera<ref name=\"stylish-presto\">{{cite web |title=Stylish for Opera |author=gera2ld |publisher=Opera Software ASA |date= |url=https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish-for-opera/ }}</ref> are distributed as 'Stylish' by other developers with Barnabe's approval.<ref>{{web cite |title=Stylish for Safari |last=Barnabe |first=Jason |website=userstyles.org |date=April 9, 2014 |url=https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/comment/87494/#Comment_87494 }}</ref><ref>{{web cite |title=Stylish for Opera! |last=Barnabe |first=Jason |date=January 1, 2013 |website=userstyles.org \n| url=https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/34075/stylish-for-opera }}</ref>\n\n==Technical details==\n\nUser styles are CSS code designed to alter the appearance of one, some, or all sites. Stylish for Firefox can additionally style the skin of the browser itself, but the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version does not support this because the user interface is built in native Android code. The styles are applied only to the targets specified. Individual user styles can be enabled or disabled without having to restart the browser.\n\nUser styles are added to the CSS rules provided by the site, but can also override the site's styling (often requiring the <code>!important</code> keyword for each replacement rule). The most common uses are [[ad blocking]], applying a new color scheme, and eliminating unwanted page elements.<ref>\"[http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/61745 Make the whole Web look better with Stylish],\" Nathan Willis, Mon 7 May 2007.</ref>\n\nThere are three classes of user styles. Site styles change the appearance of a particular web site. Global styles change the appearance of all web sites. App styles change the appearance of the Firefox user interface, only supported on Firefox. It is similar to the <code>userChrome.css</code> CSS file used by Firefox and Mozilla-based browsers.\n\n==Privacy issues==\n\nSince January 2017, following the sale of Stylish to Israeli company [[SimilarWeb]], the extension has contained tracking functions that sends information on all visited URLs and HTTP requests, and information contained on search engine results pages, to SimilarWeb servers. In July 2018, after these issues were publicized by a software engineer, Stylish was pulled from both the [[Chrome Web Store]] and [[Mozilla Add-ons]], as well as being automatically uninstalled for all existing users.<ref name=\"ars-stylish-banned\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/stylish-extension-with-2m-downloads-banished-for-tracking-every-site-visit/|title=\u201cStylish\u201d extension with 2M downloads banned for tracking every site visit|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=2018-07-06|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|accessdate=2018-07-06|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/use-this-popular-chrome-firefox-add-on-google-mozilla-just-banished-it/|title=Use this popular Chrome, Firefox browser add-on?
