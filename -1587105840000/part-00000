The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postconquest transcriptions in the [[Latin script]].\n\n== Olmec writing ==\n{{Main|Cascajal block}}\n\n[[File:Cascajal-text.svg|thumb|right|upright|The 62 glyphs of the [[Cascajal block]]]]\n\nEarly [[Olmec]] ceramics show representations of something that may be codices, suggesting that [[amatl]] bark codices, and by extension well-developed writing, existed in Olmec times.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} It was also long thought that many of the glyphs present on Olmec monumental sculpture, such as those on the so-called \"Ambassador Monument\" (La Venta Monument 13), represented an early Olmec script. This suspicion was reinforced in 2002 by the announcement of the discovery of [[San_Andr\u00e9s_(Mesoamerican_site)#Indications_of_an_Olmec_writing_system|similar glyphs]] at [[San Andres (Mesoamerican site)|San Andres]].<ref>https://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5600/1984/tab-figures-data</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, a report published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] announced the discovery of the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Cascajal block]], a writing-tablet-sized block of [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] with 62 characters unlike any yet seen in Mesoamerica. This block was discovered by locals in the [[Olmec heartland]] and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 [[Common Era|BCE]] based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica.\n\n== Zapotec writing ==\n[[File:C\u00f3dice_Vindobonensis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Line 37 of the C\u00f3dice Vindobonensis or Yuta Tnoho]]\nAnother candidate for earliest writing system in Mesoamerica is the writing system of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] culture. Rising in the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic era]] after the decline of the Olmec civilization, the Zapotecs of present-day Oaxaca built an empire around [[Monte Alban]]. On a few monuments at this archaeological site, archaeologists have found extended text in a glyphic script. Some signs can be recognized as calendric information but the script as such remains undeciphered. Read in columns from top to bottom, its execution is somewhat cruder than that of the later Classic Maya and this has led epigraphers to believe that the script was also less phonetic than the largely syllabic Maya script. These are, however, speculations.\n\nThe earliest known monument with Zapotec writing is a \"Danzante\" stone, officially known as Monument 3, found in [[San Jose Mogote]], [[Oaxaca]]. It has a relief of what appears to be a dead and bloodied captive with two glyphic signs between his legs, probably representing his name. First dated to 500\u2013600 BCE, this was earlier considered the earliest writing in Mesoamerica. However doubts have been expressed as to this dating and the monument may have been reused. The Zapotec script went out of use only in the late Classic period.\n\n== Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script ==\n{{Main|Epi-Olmec script}}\n\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|right|Detail showing glyphs from 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] currently located at the Museum of Anthropology of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.9, or 162 CE. The other columns are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]\n\nA small number of artifacts found in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] show examples of another early Mesoamerican writing system. They can be seen to contain calendric information but are otherwise undeciphered. The longest of these texts are on [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] and the [[Tuxtla Statuette]]. The writing system used is very close to the Maya script, using affixal glyphs and Long Count dates, but is read only in one column at a time as is the Zapotec script. It has been suggested that this Isthmian or [[Epi-Olmec script]] is the direct predecessor of the Maya script, thus giving the Maya script a non-Maya origin. Another artifact with Epi-Olmec script is the Chiapa de Corzo stela which is the oldest monument of the Americas inscribed with its own date: the [[Maya calendar#Long Count|Long Count]] on the stela dates it to 36 BCE.\n\nIn a 1997 paper, John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman put forward a decipherment of Epi-Olmec. The following year, however, their interpretation was disputed by Stephen Houston and [[Michael D. Coe]], who unsuccessfully applied Justeson and Kaufman's decipherment system against epi-Olmec script from the back of a hitherto unknown mask. The matter remains under dispute.\n\n== Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuy\u00fa scripts ==\n\nIn the highland Maya archaeological sites of [[Abaj Takalik]] and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] writing has been found dating to [[Izapa]] culture. It is likely that in this area in late Pre-Classic times an ancient form of a [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoquean language]] was spoken, and the inscriptions found here may be in such a language rather than a Maya one. Some glyphs in this scripts are readable as they are identical to Maya glyphs but the script remains undeciphered. The advanced decay and destruction of these archaeological sites make it improbable that more monuments with these scripts will come to light making possible a decipherment.\n\n== Maya writing ==\n{{Main|Maya script}}\n\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Maya glyphs in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], Mexico]]\n\nMaya writing is attested from the mid-preclassic period in the center of Pet\u00e9n in the Maya lowlands, and lately scholars have suggested that the earliest Maya inscriptions may in fact be the oldest of Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 200\u2013300 BCE. Early examples include the painted inscriptions at the caves of [[Naj Tunich]] and La Cobanerita in [[El Pet\u00e9n]], [[Guatemala]]. The most elaborate inscriptions are considered to be those at classic sites like [[Palenque]], [[Cop\u00e1n]] and [[Tikal]].\n\nThe [[Maya script]] is generally considered to be the most fully developed Mesoamerican writing system. Mainly because of its extraordinary aesthetics and because it has been partially deciphered. In Maya writing, logograms and syllable signs are combined. Around 700 different glyphs have been documented, with some 75% having been deciphered. Around 7000 texts in Maya script have been documented.\n\nMaya writing first developed as only utilizing logograms, but later included the use of phonetic complements in order to differentiate between the semantic meanings of the logograms and for context that allows for syllabic spelling of words.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=L. |last2=Kaufman |first2=T. |date=1985 |title=Maya Linguistics: Where Are We Now? |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=187\u2013198 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.14.100185.001155}}</ref>\n\n== Mixtec writing ==\n{{Main|Mixtec writing}}\n[[File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela_5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stela 5 from Abaj Takalik]]\nThe Mixtec writing emerged during the 13th century, much later than the systems previously mentioned. Mixtec is a [[Semasiography|semasiographic]] system that was used by the pre-Hispanic [[Mixtec]]s. Many of its characteristics were later adopted by the Mexica and Mixteca-Puebla writing systems. The origin of the Mixteca-Puebla is the subject of debate amongst experts. The [[Mixtec writing|Mixtec writing system]] consisted of a set of figurative signs and symbols that served as guides for storytellers as they recounted legends. These storytellers were usually priests and other members of the Mixtec upper class.\n\nMixtec writing has been categorized as being a mixture of pictorial and logographic, rather than a complete logogram system.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kubler |first=George |date=1974 |title=Review of Picture Writing from Ancient Southern Mexico: Mixtec Place Signs and Maps |jstor=674740 |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=670\u2013672 |doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.3.02a00840}}</ref>\n\nMixtec writing has been preserved through various archaeological artifacts that have survived the passage of time and the destruction of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pohl |first=John M.

Other post-classic cultures such as the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]] did not have fully developed writing systems, but instead used [[semasiographic]] writing although they have been said to be slowly developing phonetic principles in [[Aztec writing|their writing]] by the use of the [[rebus]] principle.

Later, Henry sorted through the catalogs and her notes to determine a set list of items on which to bid.

Other common traits of scooters can include: bodywork (so the mechanicals are not exposed like a conventional motorcycle), motors combined with the suspension or wheel (rather than attached to the frame like a conventional motorcycle), leg shields, smaller wheels than a conventional motorcycle, and an alternative to a chain drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scooterfocus.com/what_is_a_scooter.html|title=What is a Scooter, Moped or Motorcycle?|website=www.scooterfocus.com}}</ref> \n\nScooters share traits with [[moped]]s, and some models could even be considered both a moped and a scooter. Adding to the confusion in many areas most scooters are road registered in the same category originally designed for mopeds (and often still called \"moped\" class), leading to scooters being referred to as \"mopeds\" in such areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carolenash.com/insidebikes/news/scooter-moped-motorcycle/|title=What is a Scooter, Moped or Motorcycle?|date=August 20, 2015|website=Carole Nash}}</ref> [[Underbone |Underbones]] also share traits with scooters (eg small and step-through design), but they are generally not strictly considered scooters in the purest sense as they do not have a floor, but they are often casually referred to as scooters (especially ones with leg shields). \n\n==Scooter brands in production==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
