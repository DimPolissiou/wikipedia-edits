It was founded in 1838 when\nnaturalist [[Giuseppe de Cristoforis]]  donated his collections to the city.   Its first director was [[Giorgio Jan]].\n\nThe  Museum is located within a 19th-century building in the [[Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli|Indro Montanelli Garden]], near the historic city gate of [[Porta Venezia]]. The structure was built between 1888 and 1893 in [[Neo-Romanesque]] style with [[Gothic Revival|Gothic]] elements.\n\nThe museum is divided into five different permanent sections:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/webcity/Documenti.nsf/webHomePage?OpenForm&settore=MCOI-6C5J9V_HP |title=COMUNE DI MILANO - Museo Civico di Storia Naturale |publisher=Comune.milano.it |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}</ref> Mineralogy (with a large collection of [[minerals]] from all over the world); Paleontology (with several [[fossil]]s of [[dinosaur]]s and other prehistoric organisms); Natural History of Man (dedicated to the origins and evolution of humans with a particular attention to the relationship of the latter with the environment); Invertebrate Zoology (dedicated to [[mollusks]], [[arthropods]] and [[entomology]]); and Vertebrate Zoology (dedicated to vertebrates, both exotic and European).\n\nThe museum also exhibits the largest Italian collection of full size [[dioramas]] (over 100) that allow visitors to observe some peculiar aspects of various ecosystems.<ref>''Le citt\u00e0 d'arte: Milano'', Guide brevi Skira, ed. 2008, various authors</ref>\n\n==Mineralogy section==\n[[File:01 20121227museostornatMilano-236.JPG|thumb|180px|Fossil of [[Vomeropsis|Vomeropsis triurus]]]]\nThe mineralogy section showcases several minerals from all over the world including the world's largest [[sulfur|sulfur crystal]] (from the [[province of Pesaro-Urbino]]) and an 8,000 carat Brazilian [[topaz]] crystal. Also displayed are examples of [[Borate minerals|londonite]], [[quarz]], [[phosgenite]], [[fluorite]], [[malachite]] and other minerals.\n\n==Paleontology section==\nThis section explains the basics of [[paleozoology]] and [[paleobotany]]. Displays include fossils of several plants and animals. Among the most valuable specimens are the skeletons of two [[Palaeoloxodon falconeri|pygmy elephants]] (''Palaeoloxodon falconeri'') from [[Sicily]] and the only existing fossil of the [[coelurosauria]]n theropod [[Scipionyx|''Scipionix samniticus'']]. The museum also houses several other casts of dinosaur skeletons such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]'', and ''[[Plateosaurus]]''.\n\n==Natural history of man section==\n[[File:Cranio di elefante africano - African elephant - Museo civico di storia naturale (Milan).JPG|thumb|180px|[[African Bush Elephant]] \t\ncranium]]\nThis section is dedicated to the origins of [[human]]s from early [[primate]]s to ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Human evolution is described from the [[phylogenetic]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Ecology|ecological]] points of view with several archaeological objects and realistic plastic models. One of the most valuable pieces is the cast of an ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' skeleton.\n\n==Invertebrate Zoology section==\nThis section is divided in two exhibitions. The first is about [[Mollusca|mollusks]] and [[arthropod]]s: displays include a [[giant clam]], which is the largest living [[Bivalvia|bivalve]], two [[Japanese spider crab]]s (male and female), ''[[Scolopendra gigantea]]'', and [[arachnid]]s like many [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s from all over the world. The second exhibition is dedicated to [[entomology]] and displays many insects.\n\n==Vertebrate Zoology section==\nOn the second floor of the building is the [[vertebrate zoology]] section: this section displays many [[taxidermied]] animals from both Europe and abroad, and many animal skeletons including that of a [[sperm whale]] that measures approximately twelve metres in length.

It allows for an individual's [[criminal record]] to be hidden from a potential employer (who may request a criminal conviction background check) provided their offending history is minor, and they haven't re-offended in the last seven years.\n\n== Purpose ==\n\n[[Phil Goff]] was the Minister of Justice at the time the Act was passed in 2004. In a media release at the time, he said it was common for employers to discriminate against job seekers because of previous offending. The legislation would allow New Zealanders with minor convictions to put past mistakes behind them. Mr Goff noted that \"Many of those affected believe they have suffered discrimination in employment, accommodation, applying for hire purchase, arranging insurance, and so on. All of them feel the stigma of being branded a criminal every time they have to disclose their convictions. In these cases, the punishment is disproportionate to the crime.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/clean+slate+act+help+500000+kiwis |author=Goff, Phil|title=Clean Slate Act to help 500,000 Kiwis (press release)|work=beehive.govt.nz|date=25 November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Justice estimated in 2004 that the Act may allow 500,000 New Zealanders (an eighth of the country's population at the time) to have minor offences committed in their youth to be suppressed. In 2015 it was reported that just over 220,000 people have had their convictions wiped since the Act was introduced.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11575709 Alcohol and drug counselling boss says Clean Slate Act is too punitive], NZ Herald, 18 January 2016</ref>\n\n==Eligibility==\n\nIn order to be eligible under the Act a person must have:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/services/criminal-records/about-the-criminal-records-clean-slate-act-2004|title=About the Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004|publisher=Ministry of Justice}}</ref>\n* no convictions within the last 7 years;\n* never been sentenced to a custodial sentence (e.g. imprisonment, corrective training, [[borstal]]);\n* never been ordered by a Court during a criminal case to be [[institutionalization|detained in a hospital]] due to his/her mental condition, instead of being sentenced;\n* not been convicted of a \"specified offence\" (e.g. sexual offending against children and young people or the mentally impaired)\n* paid in full any fine, reparation or costs ordered by the Court in a criminal case;\n* never been indefinitely disqualified from driving under section 65 of the [[Land Transport Act 1998]] or earlier equivalent provision.\n\nIn certain cases, a person cannot hide their past criminal record under the Act, such as when a person applies to work for the New Zealand Police or a job involving national security. \n\nThe Act does not prevent an employer from asking a job applicant if he or she has a criminal history or asking for consent to the disclosure of their criminal record from the Ministry of Justice or Police. But if the person has a clean slate, no convictions will be revealed.<ref> [https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/clean-slate-act-help-500000-kiwis Clean Slate Act to help 500,000 Kiwis], Phil Goff, Media release 26 November 2004</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n\nEmployers in New Zealand have become increasingly cautious about hiring people who have a criminal history. In 2019, the Ministry of Justice processed 543,000 requests for a criminal history conviction check.<ref>[https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/Ministry-of-Justice-annual-report-2018-19.pdf Ministry of Justice Annual Report, 2018-19], p.5</ref> In 2017, the Police Vetting Service processed an additional 630,000 applications.<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/103562929/police-thwart-wouldbe-fire-volunteer-by-wrong-disclosure Police thwart would-be fire volunteer by wrong disclosure], Stuff, 2 may 2018</ref> \n\n[[Kim Workman]], research fellow at Victoria University of Wellington's Institute of Criminology, says the Act operates on the underlying assumption that everyone who serves time in prison will automatically re-offend. He wants it amended so that vetting becomes less restrictive and more ex-prisoners can find work. Alcohol and drug counsellor Roger Brooking says: \"Many former drink-drivers I deal with have no other convictions. Even if a young man gets his drinking under control as he gets older, having been disqualified indefinitely at some point in his youth now hangs over his head for the rest of his life.
