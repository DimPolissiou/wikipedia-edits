The formerly independent village was incorporated into Limburg in 1971. The town is dominated by the basilica [[St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen|St. Lubentius]], which was the most important early-[[medieval]] church building in the region.\n\n== Geography ==\nDietkirchen is situated directly on the west (left) bank of the [[Lahn]] River. Its prominent feature is the towering [[limestone]] bluff on which [[St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen|St. Lubentius]] is built. The central town of Limburg is located in a widening of the Lahn valley. Dietkirchen is situated at the eastern end of this widening, with the valley becoming narrow again near [[Runkel]].\n\n[[File:Dietkirchen Weinberg.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Vineyards above the village as viewed from St. Lubentius]]\nThe old village is characterized by a large height differential, with housing plots situated on [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] formed by numerous [[retaining walls]]. The village itself is situated at an elevation of 120 to 170 meters. In the northern part of the borough, the landscape rises up to 180 meters, while in the southern part, on the banks of the Lahn below the church\u2019s bluff, it drops to 115 meters.\n\nWith a surface area of {{convert|309.59|ha|acre}}, Dietkirchen is the smallest borough of Limburg. Its surroundings consist almost exclusively of agricultural land, with the exception of the vegetation on the banks of the Lahn.\n\nThe borough is bordered to the north by the Runkel borough of Dehrn, in the east and south by Eschhofen, in the west by the central city of Limburg, and in the northwest by Offheim.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn the area of the church St. Lubentius, archaeologists have discovered traces of a cult site from the [[Copper Age]] (2000 to 4000 BC), as well as the remains of a settlement assigned to the [[Urnfield culture]] (1300 to 800 BC). Excavations in the Basilica suggest that before the Church was constructed the site on the limestone bluff had been a pagan cult and gathering place.\n\nThe Reckenforst, a judicial meeting place which exercised high jurisdiction over the wider environs in at least in the Early Middle Ages, was nearby. It was mentioned as early as 1217.\n\nDietkirchen is first mentioned in documents in 841 as \"in ecclesia dietkircha\". The village, however, is older. A low noble family, \"the Dietkirchener Lords,\" resided there.\n\nThe meaning of the toponym is unclear. The second part, \"''kirchen''\" (German for church), refers, according to the unanimous opinion, to the St. Lubentius church. The problem is in the interpretation of the syllable \"''diet''.\" Some historians speculate that it comes from [[Old High German]], and means \"the people.\" The village\u2019s name then meant \"people's church\" and refers to the prominent position of the Archdeaconate as a central church. Others advocate a pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] meaning of \"''diet''\" referring to the important [[ford (crossing)|ford]] on the Lahn below the church.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schweitzer|first=Peter Paul |year=2006|title=Dietkirchen - Der Name der Kirche und des Dorf an der Lahn (Dietkirchen - The name of the church and the village on the Lahn) |journal=Nassauische Annalen |publisher=Verlag des Vereines f\u00fcr Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichtsforschung|location=Wiesbaden |volume=117|issn=0077-2887|pages=1\u201316|language = German}}</ref>\n\nIn the history of the village, the [[Christianization]] of the Lahn region and the St. Lubentius basilica play a special role. The legend that [[Lubentius]] himself ministered there is demonstrably wrong. The beginnings of Christianity in the Lahn region date approximately to between the 6th and the end of the 7th centuries. In this period was probably also the founding of the village.\n\n===St. Lubentius===\n[[File:Lubentius Altarraum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Chancel]] of St. Lubentius Basilica]]\n{{main|St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen}}\nThe [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of St. Lubentius is situated in the midst of a park-like cemetery. Its architecture is typical of the time, characterized by heavy members and generally cubic bulkiness, from which only the interior manages in places to break away. The aspirations of the architecture and the quality of the interior decoration remind one today of the important role St. Lubentius played in church politics.\n\nThe first mention of the [[collegiate church]] of St. Lubentius dates to 841. It was built between 830 and 838. The [[parish]] counted around 425 souls at the time. According to archaeological finds, it replaced an earlier stone [[parish church]] built in about 720, which itself had replaced a wooden predecessor probably built as early as 580.\n\nIt became an [[archdeacon]]ate of the [[Archdiocese of Trier]], possibly as early as 900 and definitely by 1021. The entire part of the Diocese of Trier on right bank of the [[Rhine]] was managed from Dietkirchen. Six [[deaneries]] were subordinate to it.\n\nConstruction of the basilica may have already begun by 1021. The present structure was consecrated on August 5, 1225. Supposedly, the construction lasted only about ten years. In addition to St. Lubentius, [[Juliana of Nicomedia|St. Juliana]] was also selected as a patron of the church. In the Romanesque church lie the remains of St. Lubentius, around which many legends have formed. Probably his remains were transported from [[Kobern-Gondorf|Kobern]] on the [[Moselle River|Mosel River]] to Dietkirchen before 841.\n\nBy no later than 1326, the deanery of Dietkirchen also possessed a separate land [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] (German ''Landkapitel''), a spiritual community analogous to a collegiate chapter. Its memorial book recorded its last entry in 1709, after the rest of the land chapters in the Archdeaconate had been dissolved in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nSeveral members of the Frei family of Dehrn, a regionally important house of lower nobility, were buried at the church.\n\n===Lahn crossings===\n[[File:Dietkirchen Bruecke.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pedestrian bridge over the Lahn at Dietkirchen]]The Lahn Ferry at Dietkirchen was mentioned already between 1048 and 1098.  The operation of this ferry was given as a feudal right. The ferry service ended in 1959. As a replacement, a 145 meter long and 3.30 meter wide wooden bicycle and pedestrian bridge was built beneath the rock in 1989. Regional bike paths R7 and R8 cross the Lahn via this bridge.\n\nNear the mouth of the Emsbach, a small stream that enters the Lahn between Dietkirchen and Eschhofen, there is a ford across the Lahn that was used intensively in the late Frankish period. The imperial postal service later used this crossing on its Frankfurt-Cologne route. The area is still known as the ''Postmauer'' (post wall) today.\n\n=== Dietkirchen Market ===\nWhen the Dietkirchen [[Market (place)|Market]] began is not known, but it probably dates to the [[High Middle Ages]]. Evidence of a [[fair]] (German ''Jahrmarkt'') on the Feast of St. Lubentius dates to the late 13th century, but it is clearly mentioned only in 1538. The market was an attraction for visitors from the surrounding area.\n\nThe historical market was renewed in 1991 at the initiative of then-mayor Kurt van der Burg and with the co-operation of all the clubs in the town. It now takes place every three years.\n\n=== Prisoner of war camp and military cemetery ===\n[[File:Dietkirchen Kriegsgraeber Iren.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorial to Irish World War I dead buried at Dietkirchen military cemetery]]At the end of 1914, during [[World War I]], a [[prisoner of war]] camp was established on both sides of the road from Limburg to Dietkirchen. Barracks were built to hold up to 12,000 inmates. First, these were mainly English, Irish, and French soldiers, while toward the end of the war there were especially Russians and Poles. Italians were also imprisoned there. The camp reached its occupancy limit in May 1915. During the day, the prisoners worked in local businesses and surrounding farms.\n\n[[File:Dietkirchen Kriegsgraeber Russen.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Memorial to Russian and Soviet soldiers of both world wars buried at Dietkirchen military cemetery]]On December 23, 1914, the first prisoner to die in the camp, [[Ireland|Irishman]] Frederick Reilly (born August 24, 1864, died December 20, 1914), was buried in the nearby graveyard with full military honors. In August 1916, the graveyard, which, together with the medical aid station, was located south of the road between Limburg and Dietkirchen, was expanded into a military cemetery. On the feast of [[Pentecost]], May 25, 1917, a three-meter-high [[Celtic cross]] was erected to commemorate the Irish who had died in the camp. On August 3, a sculpture by French sculptor [[Eduard Colomo]], himself a prisoner in Dietkirchen, was completed.\n\nUntil 1920, the camp served as a transit station for former German soldiers who had been released from Allied captivity. In 1923, all of the Russian dead and a Frenchman were exhumed and reinterred either in their homeland or at larger, central burial sites. From the First World War, a total of about 330 Russians, 130 French, 60 Italians, 47 British, 45 Irish, seven Serbs, two Belgians and a Romanian are still buried at the cemetery.\n\nThe camp cemetery was reused during [[World War II]] for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] prisoners of war who had died in the camp \u201cStammlager XII\" in [[Diez, Germany|Diez]]. By the end of World War II, the number of Russian and Soviet soldiers buried there increased to an estimated 945. For that reason, the cemetery is locally known as the \"Russian cemetery.\"\n\nIn 1954, the remains of three Russian prisoners of war, who were shot by men of the SS in the last days of the war in [[Oberweyer]] and had been buried there under the direction of the local mayor, were reburied in Dietkirchen. In 1959, at the site of the no-longer-maintained French monument, the city of Limburg erected a memorial stone for the Russian dead. Between 1998 and 2005, the entire cemetery was fundamentally renovated.\n\n=== Incorporation into Limburg ===\nIn 1971, within the framework of territorial reform in Hesse, Dietkirchen lost its independence and became the first of the surrounding villages to be incorporated into the City of Limburg. Since 2001, Dietkirchen has been part of the Hessian village renewal program. Supported by funding from this program, several old agriculture buildings, particularly on Brunnenstra\u00dfe and Limburgerstra\u00dfe, were renovated and converted into homes.\n\n== City partnership ==\n{{flagicon|Belgium}} The [[town twinning|twinning]] of Limburg with [[Oudenburg]], [[Belgium]] had its origin in an initiative of the municipality of Dietkirchen shortly before its incorporation into Limburg.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Wolf-Heino Struck : Das Stift St. Lubentius in Dietkirchen (The College of St. Lubentius in Dietkirchen), Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1986 (Part of the series ''Germania Sacra'').\n* Marie-Luise Crone: Dietkirchen, Geschichte eines Dorfes im Schatten des St. Lubentiusstifts (Dietkirchen, History of a Village in the shadow of St. Lubentius Church), Magistrat der Kreisstadt Limburg an der Lahn, 1991, {{ISBN|3-9802789-0-5}}.\n* Wilhelm Sch\u00e4fer: Die Baugeschichte der Stiftskirche St. Lubentius zu Dietkirchen im Lahntal (The architectural history of the Collegiate Church of St. Lubentius of Dietkirchen in the Lahn Valley), self-published by the Historical Commission for Nassau, Wiesbaden 1966.\n* Schulchronik Dietkirchen: 1825 - 1969 (School Chronicle of Dietkirchen: 1825 - 1969), Magistrat der Kreisstadt Limburg an der Lahn, 2002.\n* Lorenz M\u00fcller: St. Lubentius und Dietkirchen an der Lahn, Eine Untersuchung (St. Lubentius and Dietkirchen an der Lahn, An investigation), self-published by the author, 1969.\n* Wilhelm Sch\u00e4fer: Die Stiftskirche St. Lubentius und Juliana zu Dietkirchen im Lahntal (The Collegiate Church of St. Lubentius and Juliana of Dietkirchen in the Lahn Valley), Darmstadt 1964.\n* Wolf-Heino Struck: Das Nekrologium II des St. Lubentius-Stiftes zu Dietkirchen ad Lahn, Mainz, Ges. f.

The formerly independent village was incorporated into Limburg in 1971. The town is dominated by the basilica [[St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen|St. Lubentius]], which was the most important early-[[medieval]] church building in the region.\n\n== Geography ==\nDietkirchen is situated directly on the west (left) bank of the [[Lahn]] River. Its prominent feature is the towering [[limestone]] bluff on which [[St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen|St. Lubentius]] is built. The central town of Limburg is located in a widening of the Lahn valley. Dietkirchen is situated at the eastern end of this widening, with the valley becoming narrow again near [[Runkel]].\n\n[[File:Dietkirchen Weinberg.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Vineyards above the village as viewed from St. Lubentius]]\nThe old village is characterized by a large height differential, with housing plots situated on [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] formed by numerous [[retaining walls]]. The village itself is situated at an elevation of 120 to 170 meters. In the northern part of the borough, the landscape rises up to 180 meters, while in the southern part, on the banks of the Lahn below the church\u2019s bluff, it drops to 115 meters.\n\nWith a surface area of {{convert|309.59|ha|acre}}, Dietkirchen is the smallest borough of Limburg. Its surroundings consist almost exclusively of agricultural land, with the exception of the vegetation on the banks of the Lahn.\n\nThe borough is bordered to the north by the Runkel borough of Dehrn, in the east and south by Eschhofen, in the west by the central city of Limburg, and in the northwest by Offheim.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nIn the area of the church St. Lubentius, archaeologists have discovered traces of a cult site from the [[Copper Age]] (2000 to 4000 BC), as well as the remains of a settlement assigned to the [[Urnfield culture]] (1300 to 800 BC). Excavations in the Basilica suggest that before the Church was constructed the site on the limestone bluff had been a pagan cult and gathering place.\n\nThe Reckenforst, a judicial meeting place which exercised high jurisdiction over the wider environs in at least in the Early Middle Ages, was nearby. It was mentioned as early as 1217.\n\nDietkirchen is first mentioned in documents in 841 as \"in ecclesia dietkircha\". The village, however, is older. A low noble family, \"the Dietkirchener Lords,\" resided there.\n\nThe meaning of the toponym is unclear. The second part, \"''kirchen''\" (German for church), refers, according to the unanimous opinion, to the St. Lubentius church. The problem is in the interpretation of the syllable \"''diet''.\" Some historians speculate that it comes from [[Old High German]], and means \"the people.\" The village\u2019s name then meant \"people's church\" and refers to the prominent position of the Archdeaconate as a central church. Others advocate a pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] meaning of \"''diet''\" referring to the important [[ford (crossing)|ford]] on the Lahn below the church.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schweitzer|first=Peter Paul |year=2006|title=Dietkirchen - Der Name der Kirche und des Dorf an der Lahn (Dietkirchen - The name of the church and the village on the Lahn) |journal=Nassauische Annalen |publisher=Verlag des Vereines f\u00fcr Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichtsforschung|location=Wiesbaden |volume=117|issn=0077-2887|pages=1\u201316|language = German}}</ref>\n\nIn the history of the village, the [[Christianization]] of the Lahn region and the St. Lubentius basilica play a special role. The legend that [[Lubentius]] himself ministered there is demonstrably wrong. The beginnings of Christianity in the Lahn region date approximately to between the 6th and the end of the 7th centuries. In this period was probably also the founding of the village.\n\n===St. Lubentius===\n[[File:Lubentius Altarraum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Chancel]] of St. Lubentius Basilica]]\n{{main|St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen}}\nThe [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of St. Lubentius is situated in the midst of a park-like cemetery. Its architecture is typical of the time, characterized by heavy members and generally cubic bulkiness, from which only the interior manages in places to break away. The aspirations of the architecture and the quality of the interior decoration remind one today of the important role St. Lubentius played in church politics.\n\nThe first mention of the [[collegiate church]] of St. Lubentius dates to 841. It was built between 830 and 838. The [[parish]] counted around 425 souls at the time. According to archaeological finds, it replaced an earlier stone [[parish church]] built in about 720, which itself had replaced a wooden predecessor probably built as early as 580.\n\nIt became an [[archdeacon]]ate of the [[Archdiocese of Trier]], possibly as early as 900 and definitely by 1021. The entire part of the Diocese of Trier on right bank of the [[Rhine]] was managed from Dietkirchen. Six [[deaneries]] were subordinate to it.\n\nConstruction of the basilica may have already begun by 1021. The present structure was consecrated on August 5, 1225. Supposedly, the construction lasted only about ten years. In addition to St. Lubentius, [[Juliana of Nicomedia|St. Juliana]] was also selected as a patron of the church. In the Romanesque church lie the remains of St. Lubentius, around which many legends have formed. Probably his remains were transported from [[Kobern-Gondorf|Kobern]] on the [[Moselle River|Mosel River]] to Dietkirchen before 841.\n\nBy no later than 1326, the deanery of Dietkirchen also possessed a separate land [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] (German ''Landkapitel''), a spiritual community analogous to a collegiate chapter. Its memorial book recorded its last entry in 1709, after the rest of the land chapters in the Archdeaconate had been dissolved in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nSeveral members of the Frei family of Dehrn, a regionally important house of lower nobility, were buried at the church.\n\n===Lahn crossings===\n[[File:Dietkirchen Bruecke.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pedestrian bridge over the Lahn at Dietkirchen]]The Lahn Ferry at Dietkirchen was mentioned already between 1048 and 1098.  The operation of this ferry was given as a feudal right. The ferry service ended in 1959. As a replacement, a 145 meter long and 3.30 meter wide wooden bicycle and pedestrian bridge was built beneath the rock in 1989. Regional bike paths R7 and R8 cross the Lahn via this bridge.\n\nNear the mouth of the Emsbach, a small stream that enters the Lahn between Dietkirchen and Eschhofen, there is a ford across the Lahn that was used intensively in the late Frankish period. The imperial postal service later used this crossing on its Frankfurt-Cologne route. The area is still known as the ''Postmauer'' (post wall) today.\n\n=== Dietkirchen Market ===\nWhen the Dietkirchen [[Market (place)|Market]] began is not known, but it probably dates to the [[High Middle Ages]]. Evidence of a [[fair]] (German ''Jahrmarkt'') on the Feast of St. Lubentius dates to the late 13th century, but it is clearly mentioned only in 1538. The market was an attraction for visitors from the surrounding area.\n\nThe historical market was renewed in 1991 at the initiative of then-mayor Kurt van der Burg and with the co-operation of all the clubs in the town. It now takes place every three years.\n\n=== Prisoner of war camp and military cemetery ===\n[[File:Dietkirchen Kriegsgraeber Iren.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorial to Irish World War I dead buried at Dietkirchen military cemetery]]At the end of 1914, during [[World War I]], a [[prisoner of war]] camp was established on both sides of the road from Limburg to Dietkirchen. Barracks were built to hold up to 12,000 inmates. First, these were mainly English, Irish, and French soldiers, while toward the end of the war there were especially Russians and Poles. Italians were also imprisoned there. The camp reached its occupancy limit in May 1915. During the day, the prisoners worked in local businesses and surrounding farms.\n\n[[File:Dietkirchen Kriegsgraeber Russen.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Memorial to Russian and Soviet soldiers of both world wars buried at Dietkirchen military cemetery]]On December 23, 1914, the first prisoner to die in the camp, [[Ireland|Irishman]] Frederick Reilly (born August 24, 1864, died December 20, 1914), was buried in the nearby graveyard with full military honors.

From the First World War, a total of about 330 Russians, 130 French, 60 Italians, 47 British, 45 Irish, seven Serbs, two Belgians and a Romanian are still buried at the cemetery.\n\nThe camp cemetery was reused during [[World War II]] for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] prisoners of war who had died in the camp \u201cStammlager XII\" in [[Diez, Germany|Diez]]. By the end of World War II, the number of Russian and Soviet soldiers buried there increased to an estimated 945. For that reason, the cemetery is locally known as the \"Russian cemetery.\"\n\nIn 1954, the remains of three Russian prisoners of war, who were shot by men of the SS in the last days of the war in [[Oberweyer]] and had been buried there under the direction of the local mayor, were reburied in Dietkirchen.

In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]].

Peter has followed Jesus and joined the mob awaiting Jesus\u2019 fate; they suspect he is a sympathizer, so Peter repeatedly denies he knows Jesus. Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019 Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion. For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019 And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the \"cup\" he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The \"cup\" is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (i.e.: when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\").<ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion \u2013 from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] \u2013 during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as \"[[acts of reparation]]\" for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These \"[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|acts of reparation to Jesus Christ]]\" do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{See also|Life of Christ in art}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nEach episode of the Passion, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects. The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].  Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]]. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''. The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section. One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels. [[Holy Week in Spain]] retains more traditional public processions than other countries, with the most famous, in [[Holy Week in Seville|Seville]] featuring floats with carved tableaux showing scenes from the story.\n\n====In Latin America====\nDuring the Passion week many towns in [[Mexico]] have a representation of the passion.\n\n====In Spain====\nDuring the Passion week many cities and towns in [[Spain]] have a representation of the Passion. \n\nMany Passion poems and prose text circulated in the fifteenth-century [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], among which there were the first modern translations of earlier Latin Passion texts and ''[[Vita Christi|Vitae Christi]]'', and also a popular ''Monotessaron'' or ''Pasi\u00f3n de l'eterno principe Jesucristo'' attributed to a pseudo-Gerson. It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being {{convert|40|in|mm}} wide.

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\". In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]].

Peter has followed Jesus and joined the mob awaiting Jesus\u2019 fate; they suspect he is a sympathizer, so Peter repeatedly denies he knows Jesus. Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019 Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion. For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019 And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the \"cup\" he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The \"cup\" is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (i.e.: when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\").<ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion \u2013 from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] \u2013 during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as \"[[acts of reparation]]\" for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These \"[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|acts of reparation to Jesus Christ]]\" do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Each episode, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects. The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].  Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]]. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''. The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section. One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels. [[Holy Week in Spain]] retains more traditional public processions than other countries, with the most famous, in [[Holy Week in Seville|Seville]] featuring floats with carved tableaux showing scenes from the story.\n\n====In Latin America====\nDuring the Passion week many towns in [[Mexico]] have a representation of the passion.\n\n====In Spain====\nDuring the Passion week many cities and towns in [[Spain]] have a representation of the Passion. \n\nMany Passion poems and prose text circulated in the fifteenth-century [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], among which there were the first modern translations of earlier Latin Passion texts and ''[[Vita Christi|Vitae Christi]]'', and also a popular ''Monotessaron'' or ''Pasi\u00f3n de l'eterno principe Jesucristo'' attributed to a pseudo-Gerson. It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates. However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being {{convert|40|in|mm}} wide. Traditional Bethlehem cloth is striped like pajama material.<ref>Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, exhibition notes</ref> It would thus appear that Jesus' \"[[Seamless robe of Jesus|seamless robe]]\" was made of cloth from either Bethlehem or Damascus.\n*A tradition linked to [[icon]]s of Jesus holds that [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] was a pious woman of Jerusalem who then gave [[Veil of Veronica|her kerchief]] to him to wipe his forehead.
