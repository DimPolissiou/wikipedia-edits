Pliny recorded the Roman tradition that [[Zoroaster]] had lived on cheese.<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], iii .85.</ref>\n\nBy [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], cheese-making was a mature art and common food group. [[Columella]]'s ''De Re Rustica'' (circa 65 CE) details a cheese-making process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] (77 CE) devotes two chapters (XI, 96-97) to the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. He stated that the best cheeses came from ''pagi'' near [[N\u00eemes]], and were identifiable as [[Loz\u00e8re]] and [[G\u00e9vaudan]] and had to be eaten fresh.\n\n== Post-Roman Europe ==\nMost cheeses were initially recorded in the late [[Middle Ages]].

As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers encountered unfamiliar cheeses.

Animal skins and inflated internal organs already provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs. Curdling milk in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds, which could easily have led to the conscious addition of [[rennet]].\n\nHard salted cheese is likely to have accompanied dairying from the outset. It is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate. Dairying existed around 4,000 BC in the [[grasslands of the Sahara]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simoons |first1=Frederick J. |date=July 1971 |title=The antiquity of dairying in Asia and Africa |journal=Geographical Review |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages= 431\u2013439|publisher=American Geographical Society |doi= 10.2307/213437|url= |jstor=213437 }}<!--|accessdate=9 December 2012--></ref> Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation.

Pliny recorded the Roman tradition that [[Zoroaster]] had lived on cheese.<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], iii .85.</ref>\n\nBy [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], cheese-making was a mature art and common food group. [[Columella]]'s ''De Re Rustica'' (circa 65 CE) details a cheese-making process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] (77 CE) devotes two chapters (XI, 96-97) to the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

Tippie. Tippie purchased the old Yazoo lawnmower sales and service building and renovated the building using the plans of chief engineer Mike Hales, who also designed the studios of KURV after the fire. Tippie then purchased radio station KRIO in McAllen and also KNCN, C101, in Corpus Christi.\n\n==Format==\nInitially, KVLY used to be a traditional Soft Adult Contemporary radio station, playing well-known hits dating back to the 1960s, even including a nightly \"love songs\" program. However, in recent years, KVLY began playing more contemporary hit radio (TOP40).\n\nThen in 2008, KVLY cancelled \"Love Songs\" (which by then aired on Sunday-Thursday nights) in favor of more upbeat music and the new \"Top 8 at 8:00\".\n\nKVLY-FM was classified as a Hot Adult Contemporary radio station with a target audience of Adults 18-49.\n\nOn August 31, 2009 KVLY-FM moved the Billy Bush show to 10pm in favor of a new local love songs program titled \"Heartbeats\", airing from 7-10pm (Monday-Friday nights). The Billy Bush show returned to the 7pm-11pm hours in July 2010.\n\nIn August 2010 the station started playing more top hits, becoming more of a Mainstream Top 40 than a Modern AC. This is done in order to compete with rivals [[KBFM]] and [[XHAVO-FM]].  [[Mediabase]] & [[Nielsen BDS]] have since moved KVLY to the [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] panel by February [[2011 in radio|2011]].\n\nIn April 2011 KVLY ushered in a new program branded as \"The Nightly Hook-Up\" which consisted of the only live music mixing week nights and during the weekends. This was done in order to compete with rival [[KBFM]] and their pre-recorded mixshow in the evenings. The original programming for \"The Nightly Hook-Up\" began from the 10pm - Midnight slot weeknights and 6pm - Midnight on Saturday nights. The show was eventually added to the 5pm hour weekdays in order to counter other rival's shows at this time.\n\nOn September 19, 2011 saw an increase in listeners and \"The Nightly Hook-Up\" was moved to the prime time slot weeknights during the premiere of \"Nani's Neighborhood\" from 8pm - 10pm, while keeping all other original times of \"The Nightly Hook-Up\" as established, thus sparking a \"mix war\" with rival [[KBFM]]. Currently \"The Nightly Hook-Up\" is the only \"live\" mixshow in the McAllen-Brownsville-Harlingen market that allows listeners to instantly call in and request a song to be \"mixed\" in.\n\nIn August 2011, Entravision Communications added Radio Production Director, AJ Leal to head up the Valley's only live mid-day program in the McAllen-Brownsville-Harlingen Radio market, instituting a new show, \"New At Noon\" in Spring 2012.  The show's mission is to introduce never-before-heard songs (soon to be released for Radio play) first. In 2012, Program Director Alex Duran, gave the go-ahead to utilize AJ Leal's production capabilities to energize the imaging effect of 107.9 Mix FM and introduced a new \"Mainstream Top 40\" sound.\n\nIn February 2015, AJ Leal was quietly removed from all duties at 107.9 Mix FM due to legal issues and was replaced with other on air personalities filling in the noon spot.\n\nUnlike many Top 40 radio stations (which have their playlists consisting of today's current music, often excluding reggaeton and bachata music from their playlists) the station includes some reggaeton and bachata songs (which are often played on some Spanish radio stations), as well some non-top 40 music material, such as [[Red (Taylor Swift song)|Red]] by [[Taylor Swift]] (which is a country song), and some songs that are no longer played on Top 40 radio stations, on its playlist.\n\nIn December 2017 staff was notified of budget cuts and thus led to the release of several on air talents from KVLY and sister stations within the company. KVLY recently carried The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show, replacing the local morning show of Alex and Meridee, before changing back to its previous AC format.\n\nOn April 13, 2020 KVLY changed their format from [[Contemporary hit radio]] back to their previous format [[Adult Contemporary]], branded as \"107.9 RGV FM\".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/185989/kvly-teasing-monday-revamp/ Entravision Flips KVLY To AC And Shifts KFRQ To Classic Rock] Radioinsight - April 13, 2020</ref> The change comes two weeks after sister station [[KKPS]] changed their format from [[Regional Mexican]] to [[Contemporary hit radio|Bilingual CHR]].
