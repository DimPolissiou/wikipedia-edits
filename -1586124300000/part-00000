It is the most popular PBA team<ref>http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/16/yehey/sports/20080816spo10.html</ref> and has twelve PBA titles. The team is owned by [[Ginebra San Miguel|Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.]] (formerly, La Tonde\u00f1a Distillers, Inc.), a subsidiary of the [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC). The team is one of three PBA ball clubs currently owned by the SMC group of companies, along with the [[Magnolia Hotshots]] and the [[San Miguel Beermen]].\n\nLa Tonde\u00f1a, Inc. (renamed, La Tonde\u00f1a Distillers, Inc., after SMC acquired majority control in 1987) joined the PBA in 1979 as an expansion team.  After some rough times during their first few seasons, their fortunes changed when veterans [[Robert Jaworski]] and [[Francis Arnaiz]] arrived in 1984, following the disbandment of the famed [[Toyota Tamaraws]]. With new players like Jaworski being veterans of the game from ages 30\u201335, Jaworski would also be given the role as head coach of the young Ginebra team. As player-coach, Jaworski steered the franchise to four PBA titles between 1986 and 1997. After the retirement of Coach Jaworski at the age of 52, [[Jong Uichico]], [[Siot Tanquingcen]] and [[Tim Cone]] would be coaching the players led by the legendary \"Fast and The Furious\", MVPs [[Jayjay Helterbrand]] and [[Mark Caguioa]]. The most memorable players in Ginebra history would carry Ginebra to six championships.\n\n==Beginnings==\n\n===1979-1983: Gilbey's Gin/St. George Whiskies/Gilbey's Gin Gimlets===\n\nJoining the league in [[1979 PBA season|1979]], the team was known as '''Gilbey's Gin''' of then-owner and team founder Carlos Palanca Jr.'s La Tonde\u00f1a, Inc. franchise. Its first head coach was Pilo Pumaren and was bannered by MICAA standout Willie Tanduyan and imports [[Larry McNeil]] and [[Dean Tolson]]. Gilbey's managed to place fourth in the 1979 Invitational tournament.\n\nIn the [[1980 PBA season|1980 season]], Nemie Villegas took over as head coach.  Willie Generalao won the [[Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] honors during the [[1980 PBA season|1980]] season as Gilbey's placed fourth in the All-Filipino tournament.\n\nThe franchise played under the name '''St. George Whiskies''' during the [[1981 PBA season|1981]] Reinforced Filipino conference.\n\nIn [[1982 PBA season|1982]], playing again as '''Gilbey's Gin''' under new coach [[Arturo Valenzona]], the Gins made its first Finals appearance during the Open Conference. But they were swept by [[Toyota Super Corollas|Toyota]] of coach Ed Ocampo, [[Robert Jaworski]], and [[Ramon Fernandez]].\n\nGilbey's made another Finals appearance in the [[1983 PBA season|1983]] All-Filipino but were also swept by the [[Crispa Redmanizers]] in the first of three titles won by the Redmanizers.\n\n==The Jaworski era (1984-1998)==\n\n===Gilbey's Gin Tonics (1984)===\n\nBefore the [[1984 PBA season|1984 season]], Toyota announced its departure from the league after winning nine titles in nine seasons. As part of an agreement with new team [[Manila Beer Brewmasters|Beer Hausen]], the rights of the Toyota players were acquired by Beer Hausen. The team, owned by [[Lucio Tan]], was entering its first year in the PBA.\n\nJaworski, [[Francis Arnaiz]], [[Arnie Tuadles]] and [[Chito Loyzaga]] refused to join Beer Hausen. The internal feud between Jaworski and Fernandez, which had been simmering for several years, became public. With this development, Gilbey's accepted Jaworski and Arnaiz; Tuadles and Loyzaga joined Great Taste; while the rest of the Toyota players, led by Fernandez, joined Beer Hausen. Jaworski and Arnaiz turned the moribund franchise into a competitive team almost overnight when in the first conference of the 1984 season, the All-Filipino Conference, they led the team to the finals against [[Crispa Redmanizers|Crispa]].\n\n===Ginebra San Miguel (1985-1988)===\n\nBy [[1985 PBA season|1985]], Gilbey's was renamed as '''Ginebra San Miguel'''. However, the team failed to enter the finals in each of the three conferences, showing only a strong finish in the [[1985 PBA Reinforced Conference|Reinforced Conference]].\n\n====The birth of \"Never-Say-Die\"====\n\nOn October 22, 1985, in a game against [[Northern Cement basketball team|Northern Cement (NCC)]], Jaworski was hit by an elbow from Jeff Moore late in the second quarter. He had to be brought to nearby Medical City's emergency room to get stitches on his lips. During the third quarter, NCC was leading when Jaworski returned to the bench.\n\n:''The biggest manifestation was when, Jaworski came back from the nearby Medical City with seven stitches in his lip to lead the Gins to a come-from-behind victory against NCC. Jaworski incurred this from a wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second quarter. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon the sight of the Big J and didn't know what hit them, eventually losing to the Gins.''<ref>[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/jaworski-files-the-birth-of-never-say-die Jaworski Files: The Birth of \u2018Never Say Die\u2019], Jay P. Mercado, InterAKTV, July 2, 2012</ref>\n\nMichael Hackett also saw his name in the PBA record books by scoring 103 points in Ginebra's 197\u2013168 victory against Great Taste on November 21, 1985. This was later broken by [[Pop Cola Panthers|Swift's]] [[Tony Harris (basketball, born 1967)|Tony Harris]] in a 1992 game in [[Iloilo City]] ironically against Ginebra.\n\nFormer Crispa import [[Billy Ray Bates]] was brought in for the [[1986 PBA season|1986]] Open Conference. Each PBA team was allowed to get two imports for the said conference. Bates' other partner was Michael Hackett, who was the [[1985 PBA season|1985]] Open Conference [[Philippine Basketball Association Best Player of the Conference Award|Best Import]]. It is believed that the pair was the greatest import tandem in PBA history.\n\nThe two lead Ginebra in the Finals of the tournament against [[Manila Beer Brewmasters|Manila Beer]] (formerly Beer Hausen), with [[Abet Guidaben]] and imports Michael Young and Harold Keeling. Bates and Hackett powered Ginebra to a 4\u20131 win in the series to win the '''[[1986 PBA Open Conference]]''' and give the team its first-ever championship.\n\nUnfortunately, Arnaiz suddenly left for the [[United States]] due to injury, but was still part of the line-up, before Ginebra won its first championship, ending his 11-year career and tandem with Jaworski.  He retired shortly afterwards the 1986 season.\n\n===A\u00f1ejo Rum 65 (1988-1990)===\n\nIn [[1988 PBA season|1988]], Ginebra changed their name to '''A\u00f1ejo Rhum 65'''.\n\nThe 65ers won the '''[[1988 PBA All-Filipino Conference]]''', their first All-Filipino championship and second overall title. They entered the finals via a classic playoff game vs. San Miguel. [[Joey Loyzaga]] made a perfect pass to Romulo Mamaril and made the game winning basket. A\u00f1ejo took on new team [[Star Hotshots|Purefoods]] in the Finals. A\u00f1ejo won the series 3\u20131 over the young Purefoods team led by [[Jerry Codi\u00f1era]], [[Alvin Patrimonio]], and [[Jojo Lastimosa]] (who had a confrontation with Jaworski). During this time, Fernandez was benched by Purefoods for alleged game-fixing. In the final game, three 65ers scored 25 points or more&nbsp;\u2013 [[Joey Loyzaga]], [[Dondon Ampalayo]], and [[Sonny Jaworski]]&nbsp;\u2013 as the 65ers did not allow the then rookie-laden Purefoods team to gain confidence. The game was close all throughout until the final 3 minutes of the game when Loyzaga and Jaworski uncorked 3-pointers that iced the win. This team is known as the best ''All-Filipino'' underdog team ever to grabbed the All-Filipino Cup.  [http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=9&view=findpost&p=18]\n\nA\u00f1ejo also clinched the '''[[1988 PBA/IBA World Challenge Cup]]''' with Bobby Parks as their import by beating international teams and beating [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Air Force]] in the lone final game.\n\nIn the season-ending Reinforced Conference wherein teams were allowed two imports each, A\u00f1ejo again hired the great Billy Ray Bates and paired him with [[Kevin Gamble]]. After only four games, the PBA's \"greatest import ever\" was sent home for good. The 65er would finish the season with the exciting and high-scoring duo of Joe Ward and Tommy Davis as imports.\n\nOn the next season, A\u00f1ejo lost in five games to [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]] winning [[San Miguel Beermen]] in the [[1989 PBA Reinforced Conference|Reinforced Conference]].  In that conference, the 65ers paraded another super import in Carlos Briggs, who easily won the Best Import Award.\n\nIn [[1990 PBA season|1990]], A\u00f1ejo entered the finals of the First Conference against [[Benjie Paras]] and the [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Shell Rimula X]] team. In Game Six, with Shell already leading the series 3\u20132, A\u00f1ejo protested a foul on Rey Cuenco with a few minutes left in the second quarter. This led to the infamous walk out of A\u00f1ejo. The team also complained about the unfavorable officiating as the team had more fouls than Shell. In the end, the game was forfeited and awarded the title to the Oilers.\n\nThe result of this event gave the team a fine of more than 500,000 [[Philippine peso|PHP]] which was then the highest fine in league history.\n\n===Ginebra San Miguel (1991-1996)===\n\nIn [[1991 PBA season|1991]], A\u00f1ejo reverted to playing as '''Ginebra San Miguel'''. They met [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Shell]] again in the [[1991 PBA First Conference Finals|finals]] of the '''[[1991 PBA First Conference]]'''. The Oilers goes up 3\u20131 in the series,needing only a win to clinch the series,but [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Shell]] blew a 3-1 lead as Ginebra managed a furious comeback to force a seventh game. In the final seconds of Game 7, an off-balanced shot by Rudy Distrito with a second remaining sealed Ginebra's third PBA title and completed the greatest comeback in PBA history.\n\nGinebra placed third in the [[1992 PBA season|1992]] Reinforced Conference. But at that time, the team was starting to fade.\n\nIn the [[1993 PBA season|1993]] pre-season, the Gins were given the second overall pick in the 1993 PBA draft behind new team [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia Realty]] which replaced Presto. They drafted former FEU power forward Victor Pablo but immediately traded him to [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|7-Up]] for veterans Manny Victorino and Alejo Alolor. The said trade was lambasted by most fans, and it cost Ginebra their performance for the year where they compiled a 9\u201326 record in all three conferences. This horrible performance gave them the top pick in the next draft.\n\nIn [[1994 PBA season|1994]], in an effort to change their fortunes, the team was renamed as ''Tonde\u00f1a Rhum 65 ''. The team selected Noli Locsin with their first pick, and was hoped to make team better. But Tonde\u00f1a's struggles continued, winning just 12 of the 32 games that year.\n\nIn [[1995 PBA season|1995]], the team reverted again to Ginebra. They selected 7\u20320\u2033 center [[E.J. Feihl]] and also drafted Jaworski's son, Robert Jr. The drafting of Feihl surprised people. They were expecting Ginebra to either draft [[Kenneth Duremdes]] or [[Jeffrey Cariaso]] at that time. Jaworski later quoted, \"''It's not everyday that you see a 7-footer applying for the draft''.\" Unfortunately, misfortunes still struck the team as Ginebra won only 5 of the 30 games played that year, capped by a 0\u201310 win-loss record during the Governors' Cup.  The worst season triggered rumors that the Gins was disbanding.  But the rumor was quickly killed off after the team posted a printed advertisement in major newspapers that they were staying in the PBA. Ginebra got the top pick again in the next draft.  This was the last time a PBA team with the worst record was awarded the top pick in the draft.  In the succeeding drafts, the worst PBA team had to compete with the second worst team via lottery to determine the top pick in the draft.\n\nIn [[1996 PBA season|1996]], Ginebra used the top overall pick to draft controversial center [[Marlou Aquino]] from [[Adamson University]]. Aquino was a big star in the [[Philippine Basketball League|PBL]] for Nikon and Stag Pale Pilsen but was involved in a controversial scandal in terms of his academic status at Adamson, although this was later neglected when he jumped pro. Aquino showed the promise Ginebra fans expected during the All-Filipino Conference. It also showed the discovery of former [[University of Santo Tomas]] guard [[Bal David]] as one of the team's popular players along with [[Vince Hizon]], Jayvee Gayoso, and Pido Jarencio.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, the team paraded [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] veteran Henry James as Ginebra wound up in an elimination game against Formula Shell. But Kenny Redfield's buzzer-beating three enabled Shell to enter the finals. Ginebra finally entered the Finals of the Governors' Cup but lost to the [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]] winning [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Milkmen]] in five games.\n\nAquino's impact on Ginebra gave the team a 30-game improvement from a year ago and was named as the [[Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]].\n\n===Gordon's Gin Boars (1997-1998)===\n\nIn [[1997 PBA season|1997]], Ginebra was renamed, this time as the '''Gordon's Gin Boars'''. Gordon's was now a contender for the league's 23rd season.\n\nOne of the most memorable shots in team history was Bal David's final second heave from half-court to defeat San Miguel Beer by two points.\n\nGordon's entered the Finals of the All-Filipino against [[Star Hotshots|Purefoods Corned Beef]]. Purefoods managed to take a 3\u20131 series lead. In Game Five, they were about to score a winning basket after a Gordon's turnover. But Vince Hizon blocked Dindo Pumaren's layup, as the Boars lived another day. Unfortunately, in Game Six, the strong performance of [[Alvin Patrimonio]] and company denied Gordon's a title losing the series 4\u20132. The loss marked Jaworski's (player-coach) last game with the La Tonde\u00f1a franchise and did not enter himself in a game since.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, NBA veteran [[Chris King (basketball)|Chris King]] became a replacement in time for the semis of the tournament. Gordon's met sister-team [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] in an elimination semifinal match. It was a true classic game that went to double overtime. The Boars were down by five in the dying seconds of regulation then came back to tie the game and win it double overtime period. The Boars won, 106\u2013100, in what is considered their longest playoff game to clinch the second finals berth. In the [[1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals|finals]], Gordon's eventually defeated [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]] in six games for the '''[[1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup]]''' trophy, their first title in six years. This was their 4th over-all title and the last under Jaworski. [[Marlou Aquino|Aquino]] was named Finals MVP. During this time, Jaworski thanked Gordon's fans for their support.\n\nExpectations were high for the Governors' Cup, but they were eliminated by [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia]] in the quarterfinals.\n\n===Jaworski resigns===\n\nIn [[1998 PBA season|1998]], Jaworski ran for a [[Senate of the Philippines|senatorial seat]] for the elections which he won by a lot of votes. This led to a conflict between Jaworski's role in the Senate and his role as coach of Ginebra (named during the Commissioner's Cup). Assistant Rino Salazar was named as interim coach at one point. Ginebra still struggled despite the addition of Bong Alvarez to the team.\n\nThat year, [[Danding Cojuangco]] regained ownership of [[San Miguel Corporation]]. One of the moves the team made was adding [[Allan Caidic]] from San Miguel Beer. This caused a rift between Jaworski and the new management because he was not informed of the move. In a press conference held at the Senate, Jaworski resigned as player-coach of Ginebra.\n\nJaworski was considered the oldest basketball player on any roster at 52 years of age during this time before he retired.\n\n==Barangay Ginebra Kings and the \"Fast and the Furious\" era (1999-2017)==\n\nIn [[1999 PBA season|1999]], the team was then officially called '''Barangay Ginebra Kings'''.\n\nIn the All-Filipino, Barangay Ginebra only managed to finish 8th in the eliminations, and needed to win twice against the first-seeded [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Mobiline Phone Pals]] and [[Asi Taulava]]  in a David vs. Goliath elimination game. The Kings managed to force a knockout game, winning the first game. In the decider, Ginebra came back from a 20-point deficit and David's off-balance game-winner resulted in one of the biggest upsets in league history to advance to the next round. Taulava was even seen crying in disappointment after the game when he failed to stop the smaller but quicker David. In the semis, they were eliminated by eventual champion [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Formula Shell]] that was marred by a scuffle in Game 2 of the series.\n\nIn the 2000 off-season, Aquino was traded to Sta. Lucia Realty in exchange for [[Jun Limpot]].  The trade was considered as one of the biggest transactions done in the PBA.  Another standout of Ginebra, Locsin, was later traded to [[Pop Cola Panthers|Pop Cola]] during the Commissioner's Cup for [[Vergel Meneses]], but it still didn't help the Kings throughout the season. Caidic replaced Salazar as head coach.\n\nBarangay Ginebra was eliminated early in the quarterfinals by [[Tanduay Rhum Masters|Tanduay]] in the 2000 All-Filipino Cup, as well as the Commissioner's Cup. With Brian Green as import for the Governors' Cup, the Kings tried to repeat the same result of the 1999 All-Filipino against [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Mobiline]]. But this time though, the Phone Pals were able to beat Ginebra in the elimination game.\n\nIn [[2001 PBA season|2001]], Ginebra drafted [[Mark Caguioa]], a virtual unknown in the Philippines basketball scene. Despite that, Caguioa showed brilliance during the All-Filipino, earning his current nickname ''The Spark''. The Kings finished fifth in the eliminations and faced Purefoods, who had a twice-to-beat advantage, in the quarterfinals. In a repeat of events the past two years, the Kings were able to defeat the TJ Hotdogs twice, after an off-balanced game-winner by Ronald Magtulis, to enter the semifinals. The Kings faced Shell in the semifinals, and Ginebra upset the top-seeded Turbo Chargers in five games to meet sister team [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] in the finals. The Kings trailed 0\u20132 but won the next two games to tie the series at 2\u20132. In the end though, the Beermen won the series in six games.\n\nGinebra's success in the All-Filipino were not duplicated in the Commissioner's and Governors' Cup as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals.\n\nAfter the season, the Kings acquired [[Eric Menk]] from Tanduay to solidify their frontline for the [[2002 PBA season|2002]] season. Unfortunately, Menk was loaned to the Philippine team and the Kings struggled throughout the Governors' and Commissioner's Cups, again failing to enter the semis. In the All-Filipino, Menk made his Ginebra debut but the team did not enter the quarterfinals.\n\n[[Rommel Adducul]] finally made his PBA debut after his years with the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]]. Ginebra selected the former [[San Sebastian College - Recoletos]] Stag as the No. 2 pick in the [[2003 PBA season|2003]] draft. His addition though did not help Ginebra's fortune to change in the 29th season. In the All-Filipino Cup, they were eliminated by eventual champion [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text]] in the quarterfinals. They also failed to qualify for the Invitational tournament, after being eliminated by eventual champion [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]] in the qualifying rounds. In the season ending Reinforced Conference, they were knocked out by then-sister team and eventual champion Coca-Cola in the quarterfinals.\n\n===\"The Fast and The Furious\"===\nIn the 2004\u20132005 season, Caguioa, along with his backcourt partner [[Jayjay Helterbrand]], formed a strong tandem, which [[Associated Broadcasting Company|ABC Sports]] dubbed \"The Fast and The Furious\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Their play enabled Ginebra to win back-to-back championships.\n\n===2004\u20132005: Back-to-back titles and the \"Big Three\": Menk, Caguioa and Helterbrand===\n\n{|class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 bgcolor=#EB1B22|<big><center><span style=\"color:white;\">Barangay Ginebra Kings</span></center></big>\n|-\n|align=center colspan=2|<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Barangay Ginebra Kings logo.svg|145px]] -->\n|-\n|Colors\n|{{color box|#EB1B22}} {{color box|#000000}} {{color box|white}}\n|-\n!colspan=2|Uniforms\n|-\n|{{Basketball kit|pattern_b=_brgyginebra_l |pattern_s=_brgyginebra_l |title=Light uniform}}\n|{{Basketball kit|pattern_b=_brgyginebra_d |pattern_s=_brgyginebra_d |title=Dark uniform}}\n|}\n\nIn 2004, the league shifted to a two conference set-up with a special transitional tournament known as ''2004 PBA Fiesta Conference'' was held to bridge the transition between the [[2003 PBA season|2003]] and [[2004\u201305 PBA season|2004\u201305]] PBA seasons.\n\nAs the league made significant changes so did the team which made the Kings more competitive. Caidic was moved to the position of team manager and former San Miguel assistant coach [[Siot Tanquingcen]] became head coach. The team also traded Limpot and Rob Johnson to Purefoods for Andy Seigle and Rodney Santos via [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia]], which received a future 1st round pick.\n\nDuring the conference, Tanquingcen used a three guard combination line-up of Santos, Helterbrand and Caguioa which enabled the team to have a running game. It was during this time that the backcourt tandem of Helterbrand and Caguioa became known as ''The Fast and The Furious'' in reference to their running game and to the movie of the same name.\n\nOn July 7, 2004, Ginebra ended a 7-year title drought when they defeated [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Red Bull Barako]] in a best of 5 finals, 3\u20131, capturing the transition '''[[2004 PBA Fiesta Conference]]'''.\n\nDuring that time, [[Torraye Braggs]] was their import. It was considered a miracle as the team was not expected to make it far after being seeded just seventh after the classification rounds. In the elimination wildcard phase, they came back from a 21-point deficit to beat [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia]]. In the quarterfinal round, they had a 2\u20131 record, enough to make it to the semifinals. In the best of three semifinals, they eventually survived [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text]] in Game 3 on their way to the finals.\n\nOn February 11, 2005, Ginebra proved that the last championship was not a fluke by winning the next conference, the '''[[2004\u201305 PBA Philippine Cup]]''', a conference without imports. They dethroned defending champion [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text]], 4\u20132, in a controversial best of seven series. Game One was forfeited in favor of Ginebra when Phone Pals center Taulava, who was ineligible to play, entered the game. His citizenship case was still on the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation. The Kings filed a protest prior to the start of Game One. Ginebra carried the momentum and went on to win the championship. This was the team's first back-to-back championships in franchise history.\n\n===2005\u201306: Ginebra-Red Bull playoff duel===\n\nThe Kings' victory over Red Bull in the [[2004\u201305 PBA season|2004]] Fiesta Conference broke the flawless finals record of the Barakos. And it proved to be costly too, as Red Bull would go on to defeat Ginebra in the next three tournaments that would follow after the Kings' back-to-back championships, denying Ginebra numerous chances to rewrite history.\n\nIn the [[2005 PBA Fiesta Conference]], Ginebra had a chance to rewrite history by winning the last possible three conference championship [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]]. Unfortunately, obstacles such as import problems, injury to Helterbrand and the suspension of future [[Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] Menk due to citizenship issues, made the team struggle throughout the conference. They placed 9th out of 10 teams in the conference after being swept by [[Barako Energy Coffee Masters|Red Bull Barako]] in the best of 3 wildcard phase of the playoffs. Red Bull took 4th place after being defeated by eventual champion, and Ginebra's sister team, [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]].\n\nIn the [[2006 PBA Fiesta Conference Playoffs|2005\u20132006 Fiesta Conference]], Ginebra was seeded to the semifinals after winning the second seed playoff against [[Barako Energy Coffee Masters|Red Bull]]. Original import Sean Lampley was replaced in time for the playoffs, by former [[Auburn University]] standout [[Chris Porter (basketball)|Chris Porter]], in order to strengthen Ginebra's quest to regain the Fiesta Conference title. But his addition was not enough to help the Kings reach the Finals.\n\nThey faced [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Red Bull]] again in the semifinals, and eventually lost in the series, 4\u20133. The Kings came back and tied the series, after being down 1\u20133. It was an emotional series, who were expecting for a repeat of the historic comeback made by the team during the [[1991 PBA season|1991]] First Conference.\n\nAfter the series, Tanquingcen apologized to the team's fans. It was also revealed that Caguioa was playing hurt and had a hamstring injury throughout the series. Ginebra battled [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] in the third place game but lost. In that game, a lackluster Ginebra team played, which was believed to be still emotionally down from their game 7 defeat. [[Barako Energy Coffee Masters|Red Bull]] eventually won the championship against [[Derby Ace Llamados|Purefoods Chunkee]] in six games.\n\nIn the [[2006 PBA Philippine Cup Playoffs|2005\u20132006 Philippine Cup]], Ginebra finished with a 7\u20139 record in the classification. Being defending champions, they were considered as favorites to win the tournament. Unfortunately, injuries haunted the team as players began to fall one by one. Standouts Menk and Adducul and rotation players Santos and Seigle all suffered injuries during the conference. The Kings made a gallant stand in the wildcard phase as reserves Mark Macapagal, Allan Salangsang, Manny Ramos and Ervin Sotto stepped up their game. Ginebra took the sixth and final spot in the quarterfinals after defeating Air21 on June 4 with a 118\u2013114 overtime victory as Caguioa recorded a career-high 45 points.\n\nHowever, the Kings still fell short as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Red Bull, 3\u20132. After Ginebra led 2\u20131 in the series, the Barakos clinched the series by defeating the Kings by more than 25 points in the last two games. Red Bull went on to survive the [[San Miguel Beermen|Beermen]] in seven semis games, before being denied a [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]] themselves by the [[Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants|Giants]].\n\n===2006\u201307 Season: Sister Act (Ginebra vs. SMB)===\n\nIn the off season, the Kings were involved in the controversial three-way-team trade with [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]. The first part of the trade saw the Express sending Ryan Bernardo and its 2007 and 2008 first-round draft picks to the Tigers for [[Rafi Reavis]], [[Billy Mamaril]] and the rights to [[Rudy Hatfield]]. The second part sent Reavis, Mamaril and Hatfield's rights from the Express to the Kings for [[Kalani Ferreria]], Aries Dimaunahan, Manny Ramos, and [[Ervin Sotto]] plus Ginebra's two second round draft picks that year and a future first-round pick. The third part was voided by former commissioner [[Noli Eala]], which would have allowed the Express to regain its own 2007 and 2008 picks plus the Tigers' 2008 second round draft pick from Coke, in exchange for Ferreria and Ramos plus the second-round pick this year and the future first-round pick. [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] and [[Coca-Cola Tigers|Coca-Cola]] submitted a revised version of that part of the trade and was approved by Eala.\n\nUnder the revised version, the Express will trade Ramos and Ferreria plus two second-round picks acquired from [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] and Ginebra to the Tigers. The Tigers retained [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]'s 2007 and 2008 first-round picks but traded away their 2008 and 2009 first-round picks.\n\nThe trade was viewed by many within the league as a one-sided trade. It also speculated the rumors of Coca-Cola's possible disbandment from the league, which was denied in a statement released by the president of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc.(CCBPI) and PBA board of governors for [[Coca-Cola]].\n\nAlso, the coaching staff underwent a revamp with Jong Uichico, from sister team [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel Beer]], taking over coaching duties from Tanquingcen. Tanquingcen became assistant coach, along with Art Dela Cruz and [[Juno Sauler]]. Dela Cruz is also from [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]], having served as assistant coach, while Sauler is a holdover from Tanquingcen's coaching staff. Uichico, Tanquincen, and Dela Cruz powered the Beermen in their late-90's championship run and also helped win their 17th title.\n\nAs part of their preparations for the [[2006-07 PBA season]], the team competed in the 6th Shell Rimula Brunei Cup but failed to make it to the semis after losing close games. They started the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] pre-season tournament with a 90\u201375 drubbing of [[Derby Ace Llamados|Purefoods]], [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1162&Itemid=59] but failed to advance to the pre-season finals due to an inferior 2\u20132 record.\n\nHatfield made a league comeback and signed with Ginebra. [[Johnny Abarrientos]] followed suit two weeks before the start of the season.\n\n[[Image:Ginebra@Cuneta.jpg|thumb|Ginebra prior to their game against San Miguel at the [[Cuneta Astrodome]].]]\n\nIn the season opener, the Kings defeated the expansion team, [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters|Welcoat Dragons]], 102\u201369, on October 1. Two victories over sister team Purefoods and Air21 gave Ginebra a good 3\u20130 start before being defeated by Red Bull on October 15.\n\nAdducul was later sent to San Miguel as part of a three-team deal which involved Red Bull, a non-SMC club. [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1229&Itemid=82] Ironically, the following game saw the two sister teams face off at the [[Cuneta Astrodome]], in a game which the Kings won in overtime, 101\u201397, after the Beermen led by as much as 20 points during regulation.\n\nAt the middle of the classification round, changes still happened to the team. The team acquired [[Ronald Tubid]] from the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]. [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1251&Itemid=82] The team managers of the SMC teams were also shuffled. Ginebra's team manager, Caidic was replaced by [[Samboy Lim]] and he was sent to Coca-Cola.\n\nThe Kings advanced straight to the semifinals after becoming the no. 1 team at the end of the classification phase. [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1347&Itemid=82] In the semifinals series against [[Talk N' Text Phone Pals|Talk N' Text]], they were able to win the crucial Game 5 after the series was tied 2\u20132, leading to the series clinching Game 6 win.\n\nIn the finals, Ginebra met San Miguel and fell behind 0\u20132 in the series similar to their 2001 showdown. But unlike in 2001, this time the outcome was different. The Kings would win the next four games, with games 3 and 4 being blowouts, to win the '''[[2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup]]''', becoming only the fifth PBA team to win the title after losing the first two games. It was a sweet revenge for the Kings as Helterbrand, who sank two crucial free throws in Game 6, was named Finals MVP. Caguioa also won the Best Player of the Conference award.\n\nAfter winning the Philippine Cup, starters Caguioa, Helterbrand, and Menk were all loaned to play for the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine national team]] competing in the FIBA-Asia Championship. They also lost Hatfield early in the first round due to personal problems, but their import Rod Nealy provided the scoring for the Kings. Despite a depleted lineup, they still managed to finish 12\u20136 as 3rd seed and earned an outright quarterfinals berth, mainly due to the strong play of Egay Echavez, Mark Macapagal and Gec Chia who shined in the absence of the starters. In the quarterfinals, they faced San Miguel, but ended the series differently. This time the Kings took Game 1 with a 113\u201387 victory but San Miguel took Game 2 and won an overtime thriller 117\u2013114 in Game 3, thwarting the Kings' chance to win a second pair of back-to-back titles.\n\n===2007\u201308 Season: 8th PBA title===\n\nIn the off-season, the Kings made few adjustments to their roster by trading Macapagal to Coca-Cola for guard [[Chris Pacana]] and Chia to Talk 'N Text for veteran Victor Pablo, who finally donned the Ginebra jersey 15 years after he was drafted. They also boosted their backcourt by drafting [[Macky Escalona]] from Ateneo and acquiring [[Paul Artadi]] from Air21 after being traded by Purefoods. They also added depth by getting [[Willy Wilson]]. Still, they lacked interior presence due to the loss of Hatfield and injuries to [[Rafi Reavis]] and [[Billy Mamaril]]. Despite having Helterbrand back in the lineup, they have yet returned to their competitive form because Caguioa got injured. They won the opening game against Red Bull but finished the eliminations 8\u201310. They ended up in the wildcard phase where they met Air21 and lose 119\u2013110, ending its title defense.\n\nAfter failing to defend their Philippine Cup crown, they signed [[Alex Crisano]] to supplement their front court and [[Rahshon Turner]] as their import for the '''[[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference]]'''. Despite a different look, the Kings had a slow start losing their first five games with both Turner and [[Ernest Brown (basketball)|Ernest Brown]]. To stop the losing streak, they replaced Brown with another recruit from the [[NBA Development League]], Chris Alexander whose inside scoring and rebounding helped the Kings win 10 of their next 13 games in the eliminations. The Kings ended on a high note ending the eliminations 10\u20138 with an outright quarterfinals berth. They faced Sta. Lucia in the quarterfinals and completed a 2-game sweep en route to another showdown against Red Bull. In the semis, which everyone predicted to be a 7-game showdown saw the Kings sweep the Barakos that included a 101\u201397 overtime victory in Game 4. So convincingly was the sweep that they shamed Red Bull all throughout the series. After the last game of the series, the Barakos went all the way to their locker room without congratulating Barangay Ginebra. This gave Ginebra its first series sweep in franchise history, and its 17th finals appearance. This also gave Uichico his 12th finals appearance (second with Ginebra) and the third sweep in league history since the 1992 Third Conference when [[Pop Cola Panthers|Swift]] swept [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|7-Up]] in the finals. The Game 4 victory extended their winning streak dating back from the eliminations to 12 (the longest in franchise history).\n\nIn the finals, they met the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] who sought to win its first franchise title. At the opener, the Kings extended their winning streak to 13 with a 105\u201396 victory. But in Game 2, Helterbrand injured his hamstring giving the momentum to the Express for a 124\u201390 rout, the worst loss of Uichico in his entire coaching career. As their injuries continued to pile up, they lost Game 3 and Helterbrand for the rest of the series. However, the Kings managed to tie the series with a 90\u201377 win in Game 4. Tubid also returned during Game 4 from a dislocated left ankle and lift Ginebra, but lost a close 76\u201373 in Game 5. In Game 6, the Kings proved that they were more worthy of the title by extending the series to a Game 7 with an 80\u201375 victory, thanks to Alexander's 37 points (20 in the 3rd quarter) to lift the Kings despite an injury plagued lineup. In Game 7, with the injury suffered by [[Junthy Valenzuela]] (tendinitis) and Alexander having cramps in the third quarter, the locals led by Tubid and Menk had a terrific performance to maintain the lead and seal the 97\u201384 victory, and won the series 4\u20133 to grab their 8th championship. With the victory, they surpassed Purefoods in titles won. Tubid and Menk was named as co-Finals MVP. Uichico also won his 8th PBA title as a coach and his second with Ginebra. A record crowd of 22,902 witness Kings\u2019 coronation, the biggest in Araneta Coliseum since the legendary Crispa-Toyota days.\n\n===2008\u201309: San Miguel-Ginebra II===\n\nDuring the off season, Ginebra decided to go on the free-agent market to finalize their roster instead of signing undrafted rookies. Due to their aging and injured frontcourt, Ginebra decided to fill their void at the forward position by signing the 6'6\" former [[De La Salle Green Archers|DLSU Archer]] [[Junjun Cabatu]] to a two-year contract. They defeated defending Philippine Cup champion Sta. Lucia and the team that they defeated in the previous season's [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference]] Finals opponent, [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]. After winning the first two games, Ginebra then went on a 5-game losing streak before moving on the winners bracket with a victory over Coca-Cola. With a victory over [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters|Rain or Shine]] on Christmas Day, they finished the eliminations with a 10\u20138 card, and an outright berth to the quarterfinals. Then they faced a familiar foe, their sister squad San Miguel. And in Game 1, they lost a one-point thriller. Ginebra then exploded in game 2 even after losing an 18-point lead in the end game, they tied the series to one game a piece. In Game 3, the Kings were stream rolling with a 21-point lead only to lose the game and the series as the Beermen went on to face Talk 'N Text in the semifinals.\n\nIn preparation for the [[2009 PBA Fiesta Conference]] and to fill up their injury plagued lineup, they acquired [[Chico Lanete]] (who was acquired by Air21 from Purefoods), [[Doug Kramer]], and [[J.C. Intal]] from [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] in exchange for their 2012 and 2013 draft picks. The Kings, though, lost big man [[Alex Crisano]] after deciding to let go of their center to [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000\u20132011)|Barako Bull Energy Boosters]] in exchange for a 2010 second round pick.\n\nGinebra's come backing import (2007 Fiesta Cup) Rod Nealy scored 42 points, 23 rebounds, 9 assists in his first game in the conference. After which, they fell to 2\u20135 before the Holy Week break and they sent Nealy home. While looking for the right import, they almost got one through former [[Los Angeles Clippers]] forward [[Ryan Humphrey]] but he exceeded the height limit of 6'6 (he was listed 6'8). After the break, they came back strong with a win over Rain or Shine 94\u201389 despite an All Filipino lineup. To beef up their lineup, they acquired [[Cyrus Baguio]] and [[Homer Se]] from the [[Burger King Whoppers]] in a 3-way trade including Purefoods. After weeks of trying to find an import, they finally signed former [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] swingman [[David Noel]] who was listed as 6'5\" to further boost their depth as they try go deeper in the eliminations. Noel made an impressive debut with a triple double (22 pts, 17 rebs, 10 assts) in a 100\u201394 win over Burger King. Noel also displayed his athleticism by showing his high-flying skills in the 2009 PBA Slam Dunk Contest besting co-imports Gabe Freeman and Anthony Johnson to win the Imports category and [[Gabe Norwood]] to win it overall joining [[Paul Artadi]] who won the Obstacle Challenge earlier as the Kings won two of the three events. His dunks included a [[Michael Jordan]] rock the cradle dunk, a tossed windmill, and a backflip then 360 dunk that gave him a perfect 100 from the judges including US Ambassador [[Kristie Kenney]], and due to the fans request, he did a familiar [[Julius Erving]] foul line takeoff to cap the contest. In the main event of the evening which is the All-star Game between the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Powerade Team Pilipinas]] and the Import laced PBA All-stars, Noel again won the All-star game MVP as the All-stars defeated the Nationals 97\u201389.\n\nAs of this moment, the Kings are 8\u20131 with Noel as their import and they clinched a semifinal berth in the Conference along with the [[San Miguel Beermen]] as they pounded the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] 114\u201371.\n\nThe Kings were without high-scoring [[Mark Caguioa]] who was still recuperating from an injury in the United States. Caguioa, one of the prolific scorers in the league, did not play in the previous conference and his absence hurt the team's campaign. [[Junthy Valenzuela]] is also on the injured list.\n\n===2009\u201310===\n\n[[Image:MillerDavid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Willie Miller was traded to Ginebra in exchange of [[Cyrus Baguio]].]]\nIn preparation for the 35th season, Ginebra was included in a three-way trade with [[Barako Bull Energy|Burger King]] and [[B-Meg Derby Ace Llamados|Purefoods]]. They sent [[Paul Artadi]], [[Rafi Reavis]], and 8th draft pick [[Chris Timberlake]] to Purefoods for [[Enrico Villanueva]], [[Rich Alvarez]], [[Paolo Bugia]], and [[Celino Cruz]]. They also traded their eighteenth draft pick [[Orlando Daroya]] to Burger King for [[Pocholo Villanueva]], but Villanueva never made it to the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/168941/sports/trades-continue-villanueva-alvarez-to-kings-artadi-reavis-to-giants/|title=Trades continue: Villanueva, Alvarez to Kings; Artadi, Reavis to Giants|website=GMA News Online}}</ref> Meanwhile, they released guard [[Macky Escalona]], and forward [[J. R. Aquino]] to free-agency and waived center [[Homer Se]]. They also released guard [[Chris Pacana]], who was later signed by the [[Sta. Lucia Realtors]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and placed forward [[Junjun Cabatu]] to the practice player list. On other reports, Ginebra coach [[Jong Uichico]] confirmed that they signed [[Eric Menk]] to a one-year contract extension for the Kings. Ginebra then released guard [[Chico Lanete]] and was later signed by the [[Barako Bull Energy|Burger King Whoppers]]. Prior to this release, they signed [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]] 18th overall pick [[Kevin White (basketball)|Kevin White]] to a one-year deal.\n\nIn the Fiesta Conference, [[Rudy Hatfield]] came back to the country and signed a one-year contract with Ginebra. During the mid-conference, Ginebra acquired [[Yancy de Ocampo]] and a 2010 second-round draft pick from the [[Barako Bull Energy|Burger King Whoppers]] in exchange for [[Rich Alvarez]] and [[Doug Kramer]] and acquired the former Metropolitan Basketball Association MVP, [[John Ferriols]], who officially became an unrestricted free agent after being on the reserved list by the [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Aces]]. Due to lack of impressive point guards in their line-up, they traded high-flying [[Cyrus Baguio]] to the Alaska Aces and got the two-time MVP [[Willie Miller (basketball)|Willie Miller]]. Ginebra also traded [[Billy Mamaril]] to Air21 Express for [[Mike Cortez]] in the latter part of the conference.\n\nThe Kings' first import was Awvee Storey but he was then replaced by [[Mildon Ambres]] because of his inconsistencies. Ambres' performance was also not far from Storey's output; the team again made an import change. Denham Brown, a Seattle SuperSonics draftee, and a standout from the NBDL squad Iowa Energy, also struggled in five games when he played for the team during the last round of the eliminations.\n\nGinebra looked for winning combinations with the new players in their lineup. But, they still failed to secure a playoff berth for the semifinals. Being tied with the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters|Elasto Painters]], they played for one-game playoff for the last quarterfinals berth. The result was, the Kings defeated Rain or Shine, 115\u201388, in the lopsided win. Barangay Ginebra then renewed its historic battle with fourth-seeded Alaska Aces in the quarterfinals. This was a rematch between the two teams that tangled in the semifinals of the 2009 Philippine Cup. Alaska took a 2\u20130 lead. Diamon Simpson powered his way to a 20\u201320 game in the first game and Barangay Ginebra as the Aces topped the Kings, 76\u201372, in the opener of this quarterfinals. In game 2 Alaska showed poise at crunch time. The Aces came up with big plays down the stretch while the Kings could not, enabling the Aces to escape with an 84\u201382 win. Simpson capped a 30-point game with his 17th rebound that sealed the game just before the final buzzer. [[Eric Menk]] and import Chris Daniels provided scoring but their backcourt were again invisible, with [[Mark Caguioa]], [[Willie Miller]], [[Mike Cortez]], and [[Jayjay Helterbrand]] struggling in the game. In game 3 Ginebra came with a breakthrough win that fanned the hopes of the team. Not one but several Kings heeded the call and resulted in a 91\u201387 win over the Alaska Aces that kept the Kings' hope for the quarterfinals series. [[J.C. Intal]], who came off the bench exploded for 20 points, delivering what Mark Caguioa and Wille Mller could not while providing both inspiration and boost to the team's cause of eluding Alaska's broom. The Kings forced a rubber match when they got balanced scoring from their roster with a 94\u201390 win over Alaska in Game 4. J.C. Intal and [[Ronald Tubid]] hit consecutive three-pointers in the final three minutes while [[Sunday Salvacion]] came through with the game-sealing free throws with 2.6 seconds left in Game 4. Ginebra failed to win the quarterfinal series with a heartbreaking 91\u201393 loss with Aces. In game 5, [[LA Tenorio|Tenorio]] drilled a difficult triple at the buzzer which seemed enough to propel the Aces to a victory and erected a six-point lead, 90\u201384, with just 2:15 left in the match. Willie Miller scored on a layup off a broken play as Ginebra cut the Alaska lead to four 90\u201386 with 1:27 to go in the game. Miller then followed up a missed layup by his teammate to push Ginebra even closer, 90\u201388, with 31 seconds left. Eric Menk then intercepted a long pass by Simpson, grabbing the ball at midcourt then zipped the ball over to an open [[Jayjay Helterbrand]] who drilled a three-pointer as the Kings pulled ahead of Alaska, 90\u201391, with 28 seconds left. But Ginebra, unable to pull a tough defensive play, when Diamon Simpson scored from underneath to push Alaska ahead for good, 92\u201391, with just 5 seconds left to play. [[Cyrus Baguio]] then double-teamed an attacking Eric Menk and stole the ball from Menk that finalized the score on a split from the line, 93\u201391.\n\n===2010\u201311===\n\nTwo-time Most Valuable Player [[Willie Miller (basketball)|Willie Miller]] signed a two-year contract with the Kings. [[Billy Mamaril]] then returned to Ginebra after a stint with Air21 in exchange for a future draft pick.\n\nThree-time champion coach [[Siot Tanquingcen]], rejoined the coaching staff of the Kings.\n\nTo start building its future, with 11 players who were age 30 and over, Ginebra picked three rookies. They drafted 2009 NCAA season MVP [[John Wilson (basketball)|John Wilson]] from [[Jose Rizal University]] and 2009 NCAA Finals MVP [[Jimbo Aquino]] from [[San Sebastian College]] in the first round and [[University of the East|University of the East's]] [[Robert Labagala]] in the second round of the [[2010 PBA draft]]. They also released [[Paolo Bugia]], [[John Ferriols]], Kevin White and [[Junjun Cabatu]] and traded [[Sunday Salvacion]] to [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000\u201311)|Barako Bull]] for a future first round draft pick. They signed its three rookies after a week, giving Ginebra a mixture of youth and experienced backcourt. Wilson and Aquino were given similar two-year contracts worth P5.7 million, while Labagala got a one-year deal worth P800,000. On July 18, 2011, Miller was traded to Air21 in exchange for Ni\u00f1o Canaleta and 2012 future draft pick.\n\n===2011\u20132012 season===\n\n[[File:Robert Jaworski retired jersey banner.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Robert Jaworski]]'s retired jersey banner at the rafters of the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] during the retirement ceremonies.]]\nAfter a lackluster previous season, assistant coach Tanquingcen was named co-head coach of Ginebra, who coached alongside Uichico as head coach. After the news that Hatfield left the Kings due to personal matters, the team selected [[Reil Cervantes]] and [[James Martinez (basketball)|James Martinez]] in the [[2011 PBA draft]], but only kept Cervantes due to the guard heavy roster. Helterbrand signed only a one&nbsp;\u2013 conference contract extension, due to his desire to find out if he \"still had it\" and if he does not, he announced that he would retire after the conference.\n\nGinebra drew flak that season for starting the younger, inexperienced guards such as Wilson and Labagala instead of holdovers Caguioa and Helterbrand, a move intended by Tanquingcen to speed up the development of the younger guns of Ginebra.  Because of that, the Kings managed to barely escape two rival teams successively, as well as experience a two-game losing streak right after.\n\nOn November 16, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] commissioner [[Chito Salud]] approved a trade that sent [[Allein Maliksi]] and former Rookie of the Year [[Rico Maierhofer]] to Ginebra, while [[Jimbo Aquino]] and 2013 1st round pick of Ginebra will be given to [[Barako Bull Energy]], and 2002 1st overall pick [[Yancy de Ocampo]] and the 2012 2nd round pick of Ginebra will go to [[B-Meg Llamados]].\n\nGinebra finished fifth in the [[2011-12 PBA Philippine Cup|2011-12 Philippine Cup]] eliminations with a 9\u20135 record. They entered the quarterfinals but they were defeated by Rain or Shine in a best-of-three series.\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Uichico resigned from the San Miguel Corporation to become one of the assistant coaches of the [[Smart Gilas]] national team. On The same month, Ginebra acquired, [[Kerby Raymundo]] (from B-Meg) for [[JC Intal]], and [[Dylan Ababou]] (from Barako Bull) for guard/forward [[Ronald Tubid]] and forward Cervantes. They also reacquired veteran [[Rudy Hatfield]] and brought back old import, Alexander in the [[2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup|2012 Commissioner's Cup]] but after three games, the team replaced him with NBA veteran [[Jackson Vroman]] the team won the playoff for 2nd place in semifinals berth. Caguioa suffered a scary eye injury on that game. Ginebra failed to advance in finals, bowing to B-Meg in semifinal series (4\u20131).\n\nIn the season-ending [[2012 PBA Governors' Cup|Governors' Cup]], Caguioa returned to play and wore a protective glasses during the game. The team hired import Cedric Bozeman, and led the team to semifinals round with 5\u20134 standing in the eliminations.\n\nThe conference was highlighted with the retirement of Jaworski's #7 jersey on July 8, before the semifinal game between Ginebra and Petron Blaze. However, the team failed again to advance in finals in a heartbreaking loss to the Llamados during the one-game playoff for the 2nd finals berth.\n\nCaguioa was named Best Player of the Conference for the [[2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup|2012 Commissioner's]] and [[2012 PBA Governors' Cup|Governors' Cup]].

They overcame a twice to beat disadvantage and defeated the Alaska Aces in the quarter finals to move on to the semis against sister team Star Hotshots. Despite being down 0-2 in the series, they were able to come back and win in 7 games, avenging their semifinals loss 3 years ago to make it to the Philippine Cup finals after 10 years against their other sister team and defending champions, the San Miguel Beermen. Ginebra was overmatched and lost the series in 5 games.\n\nFor the [[2017 PBA Commissioner's Cup]], they brought back Justin Brownlee and ended up #1 in the standing after the eliminations. However, they got knocked out by TNT Katropa in the semis.\n\nAnd for the '''[[2017 PBA Governors' Cup]]''', they smashed the hopes of San Miguel Beermen for a rare grandslam as they blew them out in the quarterfinals. Then they won a hard-fought series against TNT Katropa in the semis to enter the finals and a chance to defend their championship. Waiting for Ginebra in the finals was the same team they defeated in the previous season, the Meralco Bolts.\n\nBarangay Ginebra went up 2-0 in the series, however Meralco was able to come back and tie the series. Ginebra won game 5 at the Philippine Arena to move 1 win away to defending their championship. But Meralco came out strong in game 6 to win the game in front of over 53 thousand fans in attendance. In game 7, the attendance was broken yet again at the Philippine Arena as over 54,000 fans trooped to watch Barangay Ginebra successfully defend their championship, winning 101-96 for their 1st title repeat in franchise history.\n\nA few days after their championship conquest, long time Ginebra fan favorite and legend Jayjay Helterbrand announced his retirement, thus ending \"The Fast and The Furious\" era of Barangay Ginebra.\n\n=== 2017-2018 season: Ginebra Ako and 11th championship ===\n\nFresh off their 2017 Governors' Cup championship, Ginebra opened their [[2017-18 PBA Philippine Cup|2017-18 Philippine Cup]] tournament by beating their rival Magnolia Hotshots (Formerly Star Hotshots) during Christmas Day for the 3rd straight year.

They lost their first 2 games with Brownlee that brought their record down to 1-5 which put them on the brink of elimination. However they went on a furious 8 game winning streak that went all the way to the semifinals against Rain or Shine which they beat in 4 games to reach the Commissioner's Cup Finals for the first time since 2013.\n\nThey faced the defending champions, San Miguel Beermen. They split the series' first 4 games with blowout wins. Then on Game 5 with the series tied 2-2, Scottie Thompson scored clutch baskets to lift Ginebra to victory and put Ginebra one win away from the championship. On Game 6 at The Mall Of Asia Arena, it was a close game in the first half with the Beermen leading by 3. On the 3rd quarter, Ginebra blew the game wide open and never looked back as they went on to win the '''[[2018 PBA Commissioner's Cup]]''' for the first time since 1997. \nScottie Thompson was named  the Finals MVP. Justin Brownlee also won the Best Import Award before the start of Game 4.\n\nThe team's [[2018 PBA Governors' Cup|2018 Governors' Cup]] campaign drew expectations for them to win the tournament as they topped the elimination round with a record of 9-2.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=PBA: Cone says no. 1 seed is just \"pogi points\" but is he right? |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/pba/news/2018/10/31/pba-cone-says-1-seed-just-pogi-points-49107 |accessdate=February 2, 2019 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |agency=ABS-CBN News |date=October 31, 2018 |ref=1}}</ref> However, their hopes of winning a three-peat in the tournament ended by losing in the semi-finals to their sister team, [[Magnolia Hotshots]], who were eventually crowned champions by defeating the [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Aces]] in the said tournament.\n\n===2019-2020 Season || 12th Championship===\nFresh from their semifinals defeat in the Governors' Cup, Ginebra won their first game of the [[2019 PBA Philippine Cup|2018-19 PBA Philippine Cup]], 90-79 against the TNT Katropa.

But they got eliminated early in the quarterfinals against Magnolia Hotshots.\n\nMidway through the Commisioner's Cup, Ginebra was involved in the biggest trade of the season. They traded Sol Mercado, Kevin Ferrer and Jervy Cruz to Northport for star player Stanley Pringle. Ginebra also signed unrestricted free agent Jared Dillinger.  They finished 4th in the standings with a record of 7-4. In the quarterfinals they got their revenge on their sister team Magnolia Hotshots by sweeping them in 2 games. However they lost to TNT Katropa in 4 games in the semifinals, failing to defend their championship.\n\nIn the Governor's Cup conference, Ginebra finished 4th in the standings with a record of 7-4 just like the previous 2 conference. In the quarterfinals they had a twice to beat advantage where they faced grandslam seeking San Miguel Beermen who won both the Philippine Cup and Commissioners Cup, in a close game they defeated the Beermen and again crushed their grandslam hopes for the second time in 3 seasons. \nIn the semifinals they were heavily favored to win against #8 seed Northport and they finished them off in 4 games, winning the series 3-1. Ginebra makes the Governor's Cup finals for the 3rd time in 4 years. \n\nIn the finals they met Meralco Bolts again for the 3rd time. The series was highly expected to be a long series as Meralco is now a stronger team. \nThey split games 1 and 2, and in game 3 Meralco bigman Raymond Almazan got injured and never returned to the game, Ginebra took advantage and won the game. Meralco was never the same after losing Almazan and Ginebra quickly capitalized on the situation and won games 4 and 5 to win the series and their 3rd Governor's Cup championship in 4 years. Japeth Aguilar was named Finals MVP.\n\n==Controversies==\n* Jaworski and Fernandez, two former Toyota teammates, engaged in a feud in [[1984 PBA season|1984]]. Apparently, Toyota's players were sold to new team Beer Hausen. Jaworski, in defiance, refused to play for Beer Hausen and joined Ginebra. The franchise sell out was the final straw in the 2-year silent feud of Jaworski and Fernandez within Toyota. It finally exploded into a war between the two. However, in the [[1989 PBA season|1989]] All-Star Game, Jaworski and Fernandez were teammates for the Veterans. In the final seconds, with the game tied, Jaworski's pass to Fernandez led to the Veterans escaping a 132\u2013130 win against the Rookies-Sophomores-Juniors team in the inaugural All-Star Game. Afterwards, Jaworski and Fernadez shook hands to the delight of the capacity crowd at the Philsports Arena, which signalled the reconciliation between the two legends.\n* On May 15, 1990, Shell Rimula X defeated A\u00f1ejo Rum 65, 4\u20132 to win the 1990 PBA 1st Conference title. However, it sparked a controversy in the sixth and final game of the series when the whole A\u00f1ejo team walked out with still 2:52 left in the second quarter in favor of the Oilers, 62-47. Back-to-back technical fouls were slapped by referee Rudy Hines on Rey Cuenco led to the walkout. Jaworski and team manager Ber Navarro refused to return to the court, which resulted in the forfeiture of the game, and the championship to Shell. Two days later, the league fined A\u00f1ejo a whopping 550,000 [[Philippine peso|pesos]], the biggest in league history. It was the second time that a forfeiture happened in a PBA Finals series since [[Crispa Redmanizers|Crispa]] in Game four of the 1975 series against rival [[Toyota Basketball Team|Toyota]].\n* Jaworski resigned as player-coach of the team after the [[1998 PBA season|1998]] season due to misunderstandings with the management of [[San Miguel Corporation]]. It is claimed that the former Philippines senator was frustrated over the team's acquisition of [[Allan Caidic]] as a player-assistant coach from San Miguel without first getting input from Jaworski.\n* On May 17, 1999, a bench-clearing brawl ensued during Game 2 of the All-Filipino Cup semifinals series against [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Formula Shell]]. A total of PhP 235,000 was slapped on 16 players and one official from both teams. Shell's Jay Mendoza was fined PhP 40,000, while Ginebra players Noli Locsin, Elmer Lago, Cris Bolado and Boy Valera were fined PhP 20,000 each.\n* In the 2005 PBA Philippine Cup Finals, Barangay Ginebra was awarded the winner of the first game of the series, after Finals opponent [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text Phone Pals]] fielded the suspended [[Asi Taulava]]. With documents of his Filipino blood still questionable, the Phone Pals used the 6\u20139 center in their victory. The Kings filed a protest prior to the start of the game. Two days later, then-PBA Commissioner [[Noli Eala]] announced the forfeiture of Talk 'N Text's Game One win.\n\n==Legacy==\n* [[Gary Granada]], a well-known composer and singer in the Philippines, composed numerous songs about the Kings; ''\"Ginebrang Ginebra\", \"[[Kapag Nananalo ang Ginebra]]\"'' (When Ginebra Wins) sung by [[Bayang Barrios]], ''Pag Natatalo ang Ginebra'' (When Ginebra Loses), sung by himself.<ref>[http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/bayang-barrios-gary-granada-pag-nananalo-ang-ginebra-reprise Gary Granada, Bayang Barrios reprise classic Ginebra anthem to celebrate end to dry spell], spin.ph, October 20, 2016</ref> A different rendition of the song was made when Gordon's Gin won the [[1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals]] entitled \"'Nang Maging Champion ang Ginebra\".

It is the most popular PBA team<ref>http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/aug/16/yehey/sports/20080816spo10.html</ref> and has twelve PBA titles. The team is owned by [[Ginebra San Miguel|Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.]] (formerly, La Tonde\u00f1a Distillers, Inc.), a subsidiary of the [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC). The team is one of three PBA ball clubs currently owned by the SMC group of companies, along with the [[Magnolia Hotshots]] and the [[San Miguel Beermen]].\n\nLa Tonde\u00f1a, Inc. (renamed, La Tonde\u00f1a Distillers, Inc., after SMC acquired majority control in 1987) joined the PBA in 1979 as an expansion team.  After some rough times during their first few seasons, their fortunes changed when veterans [[Robert Jaworski]] and [[Francis Arnaiz]] arrived in 1984, following the disbandment of the famed [[Toyota Tamaraws]]. With new players like Jaworski being veterans of the game from ages 30\u201335, Jaworski would also be given the role as head coach of the young Ginebra team. As player-coach, Jaworski steered the franchise to four PBA titles between 1986 and 1997. After the retirement of Coach Jaworski at the age of 52, [[Jong Uichico]], [[Siot Tanquingcen]] and [[Tim Cone]] would be coaching the players led by the legendary \"Fast and The Furious\", MVPs [[Jayjay Helterbrand]] and [[Mark Caguioa]]. The most memorable players in Ginebra history would carry Ginebra to six championships.\n\n==Beginnings==\n\n===1979-1983: Gilbey's Gin/St. George Whiskies/Gilbey's Gin Gimlets===\n\nJoining the league in [[1979 PBA season|1979]], the team was known as '''Gilbey's Gin''' of then-owner and team founder Carlos Palanca Jr.'s La Tonde\u00f1a, Inc. franchise. Its first head coach was Pilo Pumaren and was bannered by MICAA standout Willie Tanduyan and imports [[Larry McNeil]] and [[Dean Tolson]]. Gilbey's managed to place fourth in the 1979 Invitational tournament.\n\nIn the [[1980 PBA season|1980 season]], Nemie Villegas took over as head coach.  Willie Generalao won the [[Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] honors during the [[1980 PBA season|1980]] season as Gilbey's placed fourth in the All-Filipino tournament.\n\nThe franchise played under the name '''St. George Whiskies''' during the [[1981 PBA season|1981]] Reinforced Filipino conference.\n\nIn [[1982 PBA season|1982]], playing again as '''Gilbey's Gin''' under new coach [[Arturo Valenzona]], the Gins made its first Finals appearance during the Open Conference. But they were swept by [[Toyota Super Corollas|Toyota]] of coach Ed Ocampo, [[Robert Jaworski]], and [[Ramon Fernandez]].\n\nGilbey's made another Finals appearance in the [[1983 PBA season|1983]] All-Filipino but were also swept by the [[Crispa Redmanizers]] in the first of three titles won by the Redmanizers.\n\n==The Jaworski era (1984-1998)==\n\n===Gilbey's Gin Tonics (1984)===\n\nBefore the [[1984 PBA season|1984 season]], Toyota announced its departure from the league after winning nine titles in nine seasons. As part of an agreement with new team [[Manila Beer Brewmasters|Beer Hausen]], the rights of the Toyota players were acquired by Beer Hausen. The team, owned by [[Lucio Tan]], was entering its first year in the PBA.\n\nJaworski, [[Francis Arnaiz]], [[Arnie Tuadles]] and [[Chito Loyzaga]] refused to join Beer Hausen. The internal feud between Jaworski and Fernandez, which had been simmering for several years, became public. With this development, Gilbey's accepted Jaworski and Arnaiz; Tuadles and Loyzaga joined Great Taste; while the rest of the Toyota players, led by Fernandez, joined Beer Hausen. Jaworski and Arnaiz turned the moribund franchise into a competitive team almost overnight when in the first conference of the 1984 season, the All-Filipino Conference, they led the team to the finals against [[Crispa Redmanizers|Crispa]].\n\n===Ginebra San Miguel (1985-1988)===\n\nBy [[1985 PBA season|1985]], Gilbey's was renamed as '''Ginebra San Miguel'''. However, the team failed to enter the finals in each of the three conferences, showing only a strong finish in the [[1985 PBA Reinforced Conference|Reinforced Conference]].\n\n====The birth of \"Never-Say-Die\"====\n\nOn October 22, 1985, in a game against [[Northern Cement basketball team|Northern Cement (NCC)]], Jaworski was hit by an elbow from Jeff Moore late in the second quarter. He had to be brought to nearby Medical City's emergency room to get stitches on his lips. During the third quarter, NCC was leading when Jaworski returned to the bench.\n\n:''The biggest manifestation was when, Jaworski came back from the nearby Medical City with seven stitches in his lip to lead the Gins to a come-from-behind victory against NCC. Jaworski incurred this from a wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second quarter. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon the sight of the Big J and didn't know what hit them, eventually losing to the Gins.''<ref>[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/jaworski-files-the-birth-of-never-say-die Jaworski Files: The Birth of \u2018Never Say Die\u2019], Jay P. Mercado, InterAKTV, July 2, 2012</ref>\n\nMichael Hackett also saw his name in the PBA record books by scoring 103 points in Ginebra's 197\u2013168 victory against Great Taste on November 21, 1985. This was later broken by [[Pop Cola Panthers|Swift's]] [[Tony Harris (basketball, born 1967)|Tony Harris]] in a 1992 game in [[Iloilo City]] ironically against Ginebra.\n\nFormer Crispa import [[Billy Ray Bates]] was brought in for the [[1986 PBA season|1986]] Open Conference. Each PBA team was allowed to get two imports for the said conference. Bates' other partner was Michael Hackett, who was the [[1985 PBA season|1985]] Open Conference [[Philippine Basketball Association Best Player of the Conference Award|Best Import]]. It is believed that the pair was the greatest import tandem in PBA history.\n\nThe two lead Ginebra in the Finals of the tournament against [[Manila Beer Brewmasters|Manila Beer]] (formerly Beer Hausen), with [[Abet Guidaben]] and imports Michael Young and Harold Keeling. Bates and Hackett powered Ginebra to a 4\u20131 win in the series to win the '''[[1986 PBA Open Conference]]''' and give the team its first-ever championship.\n\nUnfortunately, Arnaiz suddenly left for the [[United States]] due to injury, but was still part of the line-up, before Ginebra won its first championship, ending his 11-year career and tandem with Jaworski.  He retired shortly afterwards the 1986 season.\n\n===A\u00f1ejo Rum 65 (1988-1990)===\n\nIn [[1988 PBA season|1988]], Ginebra changed their name to '''A\u00f1ejo Rhum 65'''.\n\nThe 65ers won the '''[[1988 PBA All-Filipino Conference]]''', their first All-Filipino championship and second overall title. They entered the finals via a classic playoff game vs. San Miguel. [[Joey Loyzaga]] made a perfect pass to Romulo Mamaril and made the game winning basket. A\u00f1ejo took on new team [[Star Hotshots|Purefoods]] in the Finals. A\u00f1ejo won the series 3\u20131 over the young Purefoods team led by [[Jerry Codi\u00f1era]], [[Alvin Patrimonio]], and [[Jojo Lastimosa]] (who had a confrontation with Jaworski). During this time, Fernandez was benched by Purefoods for alleged game-fixing. In the final game, three 65ers scored 25 points or more&nbsp;\u2013 [[Joey Loyzaga]], [[Dondon Ampalayo]], and [[Sonny Jaworski]]&nbsp;\u2013 as the 65ers did not allow the then rookie-laden Purefoods team to gain confidence. The game was close all throughout until the final 3 minutes of the game when Loyzaga and Jaworski uncorked 3-pointers that iced the win. This team is known as the best ''All-Filipino'' underdog team ever to grabbed the All-Filipino Cup.  [http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=9&view=findpost&p=18]\n\nA\u00f1ejo also clinched the '''[[1988 PBA/IBA World Challenge Cup]]''' with Bobby Parks as their import by beating international teams and beating [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Air Force]] in the lone final game.\n\nIn the season-ending Reinforced Conference wherein teams were allowed two imports each, A\u00f1ejo again hired the great Billy Ray Bates and paired him with [[Kevin Gamble]]. After only four games, the PBA's \"greatest import ever\" was sent home for good. The 65er would finish the season with the exciting and high-scoring duo of Joe Ward and Tommy Davis as imports.\n\nOn the next season, A\u00f1ejo lost in five games to [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]] winning [[San Miguel Beermen]] in the [[1989 PBA Reinforced Conference|Reinforced Conference]].  In that conference, the 65ers paraded another super import in Carlos Briggs, who easily won the Best Import Award.\n\nIn [[1990 PBA season|1990]], A\u00f1ejo entered the finals of the First Conference against [[Benjie Paras]] and the [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Shell Rimula X]] team. In Game Six, with Shell already leading the series 3\u20132, A\u00f1ejo protested a foul on Rey Cuenco with a few minutes left in the second quarter. This led to the infamous walk out of A\u00f1ejo. The team also complained about the unfavorable officiating as the team had more fouls than Shell. In the end, the game was forfeited and awarded the title to the Oilers.\n\nThe result of this event gave the team a fine of more than 500,000 [[Philippine peso|PHP]] which was then the highest fine in league history.\n\n===Ginebra San Miguel (1991-1996)===\n\nIn [[1991 PBA season|1991]], A\u00f1ejo reverted to playing as '''Ginebra San Miguel'''. They met [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Shell]] again in the [[1991 PBA First Conference Finals|finals]] of the '''[[1991 PBA First Conference]]'''. The Oilers goes up 3\u20131 in the series,needing only a win to clinch the series,but [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Shell]] blew a 3-1 lead as Ginebra managed a furious comeback to force a seventh game. In the final seconds of Game 7, an off-balanced shot by Rudy Distrito with a second remaining sealed Ginebra's third PBA title and completed the greatest comeback in PBA history.\n\nGinebra placed third in the [[1992 PBA season|1992]] Reinforced Conference. But at that time, the team was starting to fade.\n\nIn the [[1993 PBA season|1993]] pre-season, the Gins were given the second overall pick in the 1993 PBA draft behind new team [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia Realty]] which replaced Presto. They drafted former FEU power forward Victor Pablo but immediately traded him to [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|7-Up]] for veterans Manny Victorino and Alejo Alolor. The said trade was lambasted by most fans, and it cost Ginebra their performance for the year where they compiled a 9\u201326 record in all three conferences. This horrible performance gave them the top pick in the next draft.\n\nIn [[1994 PBA season|1994]], in an effort to change their fortunes, the team was renamed as ''Tonde\u00f1a Rhum 65 ''. The team selected Noli Locsin with their first pick, and was hoped to make team better. But Tonde\u00f1a's struggles continued, winning just 12 of the 32 games that year.\n\nIn [[1995 PBA season|1995]], the team reverted again to Ginebra. They selected 7\u20320\u2033 center [[E.J. Feihl]] and also drafted Jaworski's son, Robert Jr. The drafting of Feihl surprised people. They were expecting Ginebra to either draft [[Kenneth Duremdes]] or [[Jeffrey Cariaso]] at that time. Jaworski later quoted, \"''It's not everyday that you see a 7-footer applying for the draft''.\" Unfortunately, misfortunes still struck the team as Ginebra won only 5 of the 30 games played that year, capped by a 0\u201310 win-loss record during the Governors' Cup.  The worst season triggered rumors that the Gins was disbanding.  But the rumor was quickly killed off after the team posted a printed advertisement in major newspapers that they were staying in the PBA. Ginebra got the top pick again in the next draft.  This was the last time a PBA team with the worst record was awarded the top pick in the draft.  In the succeeding drafts, the worst PBA team had to compete with the second worst team via lottery to determine the top pick in the draft.\n\nIn [[1996 PBA season|1996]], Ginebra used the top overall pick to draft controversial center [[Marlou Aquino]] from [[Adamson University]]. Aquino was a big star in the [[Philippine Basketball League|PBL]] for Nikon and Stag Pale Pilsen but was involved in a controversial scandal in terms of his academic status at Adamson, although this was later neglected when he jumped pro. Aquino showed the promise Ginebra fans expected during the All-Filipino Conference. It also showed the discovery of former [[University of Santo Tomas]] guard [[Bal David]] as one of the team's popular players along with [[Vince Hizon]], Jayvee Gayoso, and Pido Jarencio.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, the team paraded [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] veteran Henry James as Ginebra wound up in an elimination game against Formula Shell. But Kenny Redfield's buzzer-beating three enabled Shell to enter the finals. Ginebra finally entered the Finals of the Governors' Cup but lost to the [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]] winning [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Milkmen]] in five games.\n\nAquino's impact on Ginebra gave the team a 30-game improvement from a year ago and was named as the [[Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]].\n\n===Gordon's Gin Boars (1997-1998)===\n\nIn [[1997 PBA season|1997]], Ginebra was renamed, this time as the '''Gordon's Gin Boars'''. Gordon's was now a contender for the league's 23rd season.\n\nOne of the most memorable shots in team history was Bal David's final second heave from half-court to defeat San Miguel Beer by two points.\n\nGordon's entered the Finals of the All-Filipino against [[Star Hotshots|Purefoods Corned Beef]]. Purefoods managed to take a 3\u20131 series lead. In Game Five, they were about to score a winning basket after a Gordon's turnover. But Vince Hizon blocked Dindo Pumaren's layup, as the Boars lived another day. Unfortunately, in Game Six, the strong performance of [[Alvin Patrimonio]] and company denied Gordon's a title losing the series 4\u20132. The loss marked Jaworski's (player-coach) last game with the La Tonde\u00f1a franchise and did not enter himself in a game since.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, NBA veteran [[Chris King (basketball)|Chris King]] became a replacement in time for the semis of the tournament. Gordon's met sister-team [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] in an elimination semifinal match. It was a true classic game that went to double overtime. The Boars were down by five in the dying seconds of regulation then came back to tie the game and win it double overtime period. The Boars won, 106\u2013100, in what is considered their longest playoff game to clinch the second finals berth. In the [[1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals|finals]], Gordon's eventually defeated [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]] in six games for the '''[[1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup]]''' trophy, their first title in six years. This was their 4th over-all title and the last under Jaworski. [[Marlou Aquino|Aquino]] was named Finals MVP. During this time, Jaworski thanked Gordon's fans for their support.\n\nExpectations were high for the Governors' Cup, but they were eliminated by [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia]] in the quarterfinals.\n\n===Jaworski resigns===\n\nIn [[1998 PBA season|1998]], Jaworski ran for a [[Senate of the Philippines|senatorial seat]] for the elections which he won by a lot of votes. This led to a conflict between Jaworski's role in the Senate and his role as coach of Ginebra (named during the Commissioner's Cup). Assistant Rino Salazar was named as interim coach at one point. Ginebra still struggled despite the addition of Bong Alvarez to the team.\n\nThat year, [[Danding Cojuangco]] regained ownership of [[San Miguel Corporation]]. One of the moves the team made was adding [[Allan Caidic]] from San Miguel Beer. This caused a rift between Jaworski and the new management because he was not informed of the move. In a press conference held at the Senate, Jaworski resigned as player-coach of Ginebra.\n\nJaworski was considered the oldest basketball player on any roster at 52 years of age during this time before he retired.\n\n==Barangay Ginebra Kings and the \"Fast and the Furious\" era (1999-2017)==\n\nIn [[1999 PBA season|1999]], the team was then officially called '''Barangay Ginebra Kings'''.\n\nIn the All-Filipino, Barangay Ginebra only managed to finish 8th in the eliminations, and needed to win twice against the first-seeded [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Mobiline Phone Pals]] and [[Asi Taulava]]  in a David vs. Goliath elimination game. The Kings managed to force a knockout game, winning the first game. In the decider, Ginebra came back from a 20-point deficit and David's off-balance game-winner resulted in one of the biggest upsets in league history to advance to the next round. Taulava was even seen crying in disappointment after the game when he failed to stop the smaller but quicker David. In the semis, they were eliminated by eventual champion [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Formula Shell]] that was marred by a scuffle in Game 2 of the series.\n\nIn the 2000 off-season, Aquino was traded to Sta. Lucia Realty in exchange for [[Jun Limpot]].  The trade was considered as one of the biggest transactions done in the PBA.  Another standout of Ginebra, Locsin, was later traded to [[Pop Cola Panthers|Pop Cola]] during the Commissioner's Cup for [[Vergel Meneses]], but it still didn't help the Kings throughout the season. Caidic replaced Salazar as head coach.\n\nBarangay Ginebra was eliminated early in the quarterfinals by [[Tanduay Rhum Masters|Tanduay]] in the 2000 All-Filipino Cup, as well as the Commissioner's Cup. With Brian Green as import for the Governors' Cup, the Kings tried to repeat the same result of the 1999 All-Filipino against [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Mobiline]]. But this time though, the Phone Pals were able to beat Ginebra in the elimination game.\n\nIn [[2001 PBA season|2001]], Ginebra drafted [[Mark Caguioa]], a virtual unknown in the Philippines basketball scene. Despite that, Caguioa showed brilliance during the All-Filipino, earning his current nickname ''The Spark''. The Kings finished fifth in the eliminations and faced Purefoods, who had a twice-to-beat advantage, in the quarterfinals. In a repeat of events the past two years, the Kings were able to defeat the TJ Hotdogs twice, after an off-balanced game-winner by Ronald Magtulis, to enter the semifinals. The Kings faced Shell in the semifinals, and Ginebra upset the top-seeded Turbo Chargers in five games to meet sister team [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] in the finals. The Kings trailed 0\u20132 but won the next two games to tie the series at 2\u20132. In the end though, the Beermen won the series in six games.\n\nGinebra's success in the All-Filipino were not duplicated in the Commissioner's and Governors' Cup as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals.\n\nAfter the season, the Kings acquired [[Eric Menk]] from Tanduay to solidify their frontline for the [[2002 PBA season|2002]] season. Unfortunately, Menk was loaned to the Philippine team and the Kings struggled throughout the Governors' and Commissioner's Cups, again failing to enter the semis. In the All-Filipino, Menk made his Ginebra debut but the team did not enter the quarterfinals.\n\n[[Rommel Adducul]] finally made his PBA debut after his years with the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]]. Ginebra selected the former [[San Sebastian College - Recoletos]] Stag as the No. 2 pick in the [[2003 PBA season|2003]] draft. His addition though did not help Ginebra's fortune to change in the 29th season. In the All-Filipino Cup, they were eliminated by eventual champion [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text]] in the quarterfinals. They also failed to qualify for the Invitational tournament, after being eliminated by eventual champion [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska]] in the qualifying rounds. In the season ending Reinforced Conference, they were knocked out by then-sister team and eventual champion Coca-Cola in the quarterfinals.\n\n===\"The Fast and The Furious\"===\nIn the 2004\u20132005 season, Caguioa, along with his backcourt partner [[Jayjay Helterbrand]], formed a strong tandem, which [[Associated Broadcasting Company|ABC Sports]] dubbed \"The Fast and The Furious\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Their play enabled Ginebra to win back-to-back championships.\n\n===2004\u20132005: Back-to-back titles and the \"Big Three\": Menk, Caguioa and Helterbrand===\n\n{|class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 bgcolor=#EB1B22|<big><center><span style=\"color:white;\">Barangay Ginebra Kings</span></center></big>\n|-\n|align=center colspan=2|<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Barangay Ginebra Kings logo.svg|145px]] -->\n|-\n|Colors\n|{{color box|#EB1B22}} {{color box|#000000}} {{color box|white}}\n|-\n!colspan=2|Uniforms\n|-\n|{{Basketball kit|pattern_b=_brgyginebra_l |pattern_s=_brgyginebra_l |title=Light uniform}}\n|{{Basketball kit|pattern_b=_brgyginebra_d |pattern_s=_brgyginebra_d |title=Dark uniform}}\n|}\n\nIn 2004, the league shifted to a two conference set-up with a special transitional tournament known as ''2004 PBA Fiesta Conference'' was held to bridge the transition between the [[2003 PBA season|2003]] and [[2004\u201305 PBA season|2004\u201305]] PBA seasons.\n\nAs the league made significant changes so did the team which made the Kings more competitive. Caidic was moved to the position of team manager and former San Miguel assistant coach [[Siot Tanquingcen]] became head coach. The team also traded Limpot and Rob Johnson to Purefoods for Andy Seigle and Rodney Santos via [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia]], which received a future 1st round pick.\n\nDuring the conference, Tanquingcen used a three guard combination line-up of Santos, Helterbrand and Caguioa which enabled the team to have a running game. It was during this time that the backcourt tandem of Helterbrand and Caguioa became known as ''The Fast and The Furious'' in reference to their running game and to the movie of the same name.\n\nOn July 7, 2004, Ginebra ended a 7-year title drought when they defeated [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Red Bull Barako]] in a best of 5 finals, 3\u20131, capturing the transition '''[[2004 PBA Fiesta Conference]]'''.\n\nDuring that time, [[Torraye Braggs]] was their import. It was considered a miracle as the team was not expected to make it far after being seeded just seventh after the classification rounds. In the elimination wildcard phase, they came back from a 21-point deficit to beat [[Sta. Lucia Realtors|Sta. Lucia]]. In the quarterfinal round, they had a 2\u20131 record, enough to make it to the semifinals. In the best of three semifinals, they eventually survived [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text]] in Game 3 on their way to the finals.\n\nOn February 11, 2005, Ginebra proved that the last championship was not a fluke by winning the next conference, the '''[[2004\u201305 PBA Philippine Cup]]''', a conference without imports. They dethroned defending champion [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text]], 4\u20132, in a controversial best of seven series. Game One was forfeited in favor of Ginebra when Phone Pals center Taulava, who was ineligible to play, entered the game. His citizenship case was still on the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation. The Kings filed a protest prior to the start of Game One. Ginebra carried the momentum and went on to win the championship. This was the team's first back-to-back championships in franchise history.\n\n===2005\u201306: Ginebra-Red Bull playoff duel===\n\nThe Kings' victory over Red Bull in the [[2004\u201305 PBA season|2004]] Fiesta Conference broke the flawless finals record of the Barakos. And it proved to be costly too, as Red Bull would go on to defeat Ginebra in the next three tournaments that would follow after the Kings' back-to-back championships, denying Ginebra numerous chances to rewrite history.\n\nIn the [[2005 PBA Fiesta Conference]], Ginebra had a chance to rewrite history by winning the last possible three conference championship [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]]. Unfortunately, obstacles such as import problems, injury to Helterbrand and the suspension of future [[Philippine Basketball Association Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] Menk due to citizenship issues, made the team struggle throughout the conference. They placed 9th out of 10 teams in the conference after being swept by [[Barako Energy Coffee Masters|Red Bull Barako]] in the best of 3 wildcard phase of the playoffs. Red Bull took 4th place after being defeated by eventual champion, and Ginebra's sister team, [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]].\n\nIn the [[2006 PBA Fiesta Conference Playoffs|2005\u20132006 Fiesta Conference]], Ginebra was seeded to the semifinals after winning the second seed playoff against [[Barako Energy Coffee Masters|Red Bull]]. Original import Sean Lampley was replaced in time for the playoffs, by former [[Auburn University]] standout [[Chris Porter (basketball)|Chris Porter]], in order to strengthen Ginebra's quest to regain the Fiesta Conference title. But his addition was not enough to help the Kings reach the Finals.\n\nThey faced [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Red Bull]] again in the semifinals, and eventually lost in the series, 4\u20133. The Kings came back and tied the series, after being down 1\u20133. It was an emotional series, who were expecting for a repeat of the historic comeback made by the team during the [[1991 PBA season|1991]] First Conference.\n\nAfter the series, Tanquingcen apologized to the team's fans. It was also revealed that Caguioa was playing hurt and had a hamstring injury throughout the series. Ginebra battled [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] in the third place game but lost. In that game, a lackluster Ginebra team played, which was believed to be still emotionally down from their game 7 defeat. [[Barako Energy Coffee Masters|Red Bull]] eventually won the championship against [[Derby Ace Llamados|Purefoods Chunkee]] in six games.\n\nIn the [[2006 PBA Philippine Cup Playoffs|2005\u20132006 Philippine Cup]], Ginebra finished with a 7\u20139 record in the classification. Being defending champions, they were considered as favorites to win the tournament. Unfortunately, injuries haunted the team as players began to fall one by one. Standouts Menk and Adducul and rotation players Santos and Seigle all suffered injuries during the conference. The Kings made a gallant stand in the wildcard phase as reserves Mark Macapagal, Allan Salangsang, Manny Ramos and Ervin Sotto stepped up their game. Ginebra took the sixth and final spot in the quarterfinals after defeating Air21 on June 4 with a 118\u2013114 overtime victory as Caguioa recorded a career-high 45 points.\n\nHowever, the Kings still fell short as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Red Bull, 3\u20132. After Ginebra led 2\u20131 in the series, the Barakos clinched the series by defeating the Kings by more than 25 points in the last two games. Red Bull went on to survive the [[San Miguel Beermen|Beermen]] in seven semis games, before being denied a [[Grand Slam (PBA)|grand slam]] themselves by the [[Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants|Giants]].\n\n===2006\u201307 Season: Sister Act (Ginebra vs. SMB)===\n\nIn the off season, the Kings were involved in the controversial three-way-team trade with [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]. The first part of the trade saw the Express sending Ryan Bernardo and its 2007 and 2008 first-round draft picks to the Tigers for [[Rafi Reavis]], [[Billy Mamaril]] and the rights to [[Rudy Hatfield]]. The second part sent Reavis, Mamaril and Hatfield's rights from the Express to the Kings for [[Kalani Ferreria]], Aries Dimaunahan, Manny Ramos, and [[Ervin Sotto]] plus Ginebra's two second round draft picks that year and a future first-round pick. The third part was voided by former commissioner [[Noli Eala]], which would have allowed the Express to regain its own 2007 and 2008 picks plus the Tigers' 2008 second round draft pick from Coke, in exchange for Ferreria and Ramos plus the second-round pick this year and the future first-round pick. [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] and [[Coca-Cola Tigers|Coca-Cola]] submitted a revised version of that part of the trade and was approved by Eala.\n\nUnder the revised version, the Express will trade Ramos and Ferreria plus two second-round picks acquired from [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]] and Ginebra to the Tigers. The Tigers retained [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]'s 2007 and 2008 first-round picks but traded away their 2008 and 2009 first-round picks.\n\nThe trade was viewed by many within the league as a one-sided trade. It also speculated the rumors of Coca-Cola's possible disbandment from the league, which was denied in a statement released by the president of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc.(CCBPI) and PBA board of governors for [[Coca-Cola]].\n\nAlso, the coaching staff underwent a revamp with Jong Uichico, from sister team [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel Beer]], taking over coaching duties from Tanquingcen. Tanquingcen became assistant coach, along with Art Dela Cruz and [[Juno Sauler]]. Dela Cruz is also from [[San Miguel Beermen|San Miguel]], having served as assistant coach, while Sauler is a holdover from Tanquingcen's coaching staff. Uichico, Tanquincen, and Dela Cruz powered the Beermen in their late-90's championship run and also helped win their 17th title.\n\nAs part of their preparations for the [[2006-07 PBA season]], the team competed in the 6th Shell Rimula Brunei Cup but failed to make it to the semis after losing close games. They started the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] pre-season tournament with a 90\u201375 drubbing of [[Derby Ace Llamados|Purefoods]], [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1162&Itemid=59] but failed to advance to the pre-season finals due to an inferior 2\u20132 record.\n\nHatfield made a league comeback and signed with Ginebra. [[Johnny Abarrientos]] followed suit two weeks before the start of the season.\n\n[[Image:Ginebra@Cuneta.jpg|thumb|Ginebra prior to their game against San Miguel at the [[Cuneta Astrodome]].]]\n\nIn the season opener, the Kings defeated the expansion team, [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters|Welcoat Dragons]], 102\u201369, on October 1. Two victories over sister team Purefoods and Air21 gave Ginebra a good 3\u20130 start before being defeated by Red Bull on October 15.\n\nAdducul was later sent to San Miguel as part of a three-team deal which involved Red Bull, a non-SMC club. [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1229&Itemid=82] Ironically, the following game saw the two sister teams face off at the [[Cuneta Astrodome]], in a game which the Kings won in overtime, 101\u201397, after the Beermen led by as much as 20 points during regulation.\n\nAt the middle of the classification round, changes still happened to the team. The team acquired [[Ronald Tubid]] from the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]. [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1251&Itemid=82] The team managers of the SMC teams were also shuffled. Ginebra's team manager, Caidic was replaced by [[Samboy Lim]] and he was sent to Coca-Cola.\n\nThe Kings advanced straight to the semifinals after becoming the no. 1 team at the end of the classification phase. [http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1347&Itemid=82] In the semifinals series against [[Talk N' Text Phone Pals|Talk N' Text]], they were able to win the crucial Game 5 after the series was tied 2\u20132, leading to the series clinching Game 6 win.\n\nIn the finals, Ginebra met San Miguel and fell behind 0\u20132 in the series similar to their 2001 showdown. But unlike in 2001, this time the outcome was different. The Kings would win the next four games, with games 3 and 4 being blowouts, to win the '''[[2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup]]''', becoming only the fifth PBA team to win the title after losing the first two games. It was a sweet revenge for the Kings as Helterbrand, who sank two crucial free throws in Game 6, was named Finals MVP. Caguioa also won the Best Player of the Conference award.\n\nAfter winning the Philippine Cup, starters Caguioa, Helterbrand, and Menk were all loaned to play for the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine national team]] competing in the FIBA-Asia Championship. They also lost Hatfield early in the first round due to personal problems, but their import Rod Nealy provided the scoring for the Kings. Despite a depleted lineup, they still managed to finish 12\u20136 as 3rd seed and earned an outright quarterfinals berth, mainly due to the strong play of Egay Echavez, Mark Macapagal and Gec Chia who shined in the absence of the starters. In the quarterfinals, they faced San Miguel, but ended the series differently. This time the Kings took Game 1 with a 113\u201387 victory but San Miguel took Game 2 and won an overtime thriller 117\u2013114 in Game 3, thwarting the Kings' chance to win a second pair of back-to-back titles.\n\n===2007\u201308 Season: 8th PBA title===\n\nIn the off-season, the Kings made few adjustments to their roster by trading Macapagal to Coca-Cola for guard [[Chris Pacana]] and Chia to Talk 'N Text for veteran Victor Pablo, who finally donned the Ginebra jersey 15 years after he was drafted. They also boosted their backcourt by drafting [[Macky Escalona]] from Ateneo and acquiring [[Paul Artadi]] from Air21 after being traded by Purefoods. They also added depth by getting [[Willy Wilson]]. Still, they lacked interior presence due to the loss of Hatfield and injuries to [[Rafi Reavis]] and [[Billy Mamaril]]. Despite having Helterbrand back in the lineup, they have yet returned to their competitive form because Caguioa got injured. They won the opening game against Red Bull but finished the eliminations 8\u201310. They ended up in the wildcard phase where they met Air21 and lose 119\u2013110, ending its title defense.\n\nAfter failing to defend their Philippine Cup crown, they signed [[Alex Crisano]] to supplement their front court and [[Rahshon Turner]] as their import for the '''[[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference]]'''. Despite a different look, the Kings had a slow start losing their first five games with both Turner and [[Ernest Brown (basketball)|Ernest Brown]]. To stop the losing streak, they replaced Brown with another recruit from the [[NBA Development League]], Chris Alexander whose inside scoring and rebounding helped the Kings win 10 of their next 13 games in the eliminations. The Kings ended on a high note ending the eliminations 10\u20138 with an outright quarterfinals berth. They faced Sta. Lucia in the quarterfinals and completed a 2-game sweep en route to another showdown against Red Bull. In the semis, which everyone predicted to be a 7-game showdown saw the Kings sweep the Barakos that included a 101\u201397 overtime victory in Game 4. So convincingly was the sweep that they shamed Red Bull all throughout the series. After the last game of the series, the Barakos went all the way to their locker room without congratulating Barangay Ginebra. This gave Ginebra its first series sweep in franchise history, and its 17th finals appearance. This also gave Uichico his 12th finals appearance (second with Ginebra) and the third sweep in league history since the 1992 Third Conference when [[Pop Cola Panthers|Swift]] swept [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|7-Up]] in the finals. The Game 4 victory extended their winning streak dating back from the eliminations to 12 (the longest in franchise history).\n\nIn the finals, they met the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] who sought to win its first franchise title. At the opener, the Kings extended their winning streak to 13 with a 105\u201396 victory. But in Game 2, Helterbrand injured his hamstring giving the momentum to the Express for a 124\u201390 rout, the worst loss of Uichico in his entire coaching career. As their injuries continued to pile up, they lost Game 3 and Helterbrand for the rest of the series. However, the Kings managed to tie the series with a 90\u201377 win in Game 4. Tubid also returned during Game 4 from a dislocated left ankle and lift Ginebra, but lost a close 76\u201373 in Game 5. In Game 6, the Kings proved that they were more worthy of the title by extending the series to a Game 7 with an 80\u201375 victory, thanks to Alexander's 37 points (20 in the 3rd quarter) to lift the Kings despite an injury plagued lineup. In Game 7, with the injury suffered by [[Junthy Valenzuela]] (tendinitis) and Alexander having cramps in the third quarter, the locals led by Tubid and Menk had a terrific performance to maintain the lead and seal the 97\u201384 victory, and won the series 4\u20133 to grab their 8th championship. With the victory, they surpassed Purefoods in titles won. Tubid and Menk was named as co-Finals MVP. Uichico also won his 8th PBA title as a coach and his second with Ginebra. A record crowd of 22,902 witness Kings\u2019 coronation, the biggest in Araneta Coliseum since the legendary Crispa-Toyota days.\n\n===2008\u201309: San Miguel-Ginebra II===\n\nDuring the off season, Ginebra decided to go on the free-agent market to finalize their roster instead of signing undrafted rookies. Due to their aging and injured frontcourt, Ginebra decided to fill their void at the forward position by signing the 6'6\" former [[De La Salle Green Archers|DLSU Archer]] [[Junjun Cabatu]] to a two-year contract. They defeated defending Philippine Cup champion Sta. Lucia and the team that they defeated in the previous season's [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference]] Finals opponent, [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]]. After winning the first two games, Ginebra then went on a 5-game losing streak before moving on the winners bracket with a victory over Coca-Cola. With a victory over [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters|Rain or Shine]] on Christmas Day, they finished the eliminations with a 10\u20138 card, and an outright berth to the quarterfinals. Then they faced a familiar foe, their sister squad San Miguel. And in Game 1, they lost a one-point thriller. Ginebra then exploded in game 2 even after losing an 18-point lead in the end game, they tied the series to one game a piece. In Game 3, the Kings were stream rolling with a 21-point lead only to lose the game and the series as the Beermen went on to face Talk 'N Text in the semifinals.\n\nIn preparation for the [[2009 PBA Fiesta Conference]] and to fill up their injury plagued lineup, they acquired [[Chico Lanete]] (who was acquired by Air21 from Purefoods), [[Doug Kramer]], and [[J.C. Intal]] from [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]] in exchange for their 2012 and 2013 draft picks. The Kings, though, lost big man [[Alex Crisano]] after deciding to let go of their center to [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000\u20132011)|Barako Bull Energy Boosters]] in exchange for a 2010 second round pick.\n\nGinebra's come backing import (2007 Fiesta Cup) Rod Nealy scored 42 points, 23 rebounds, 9 assists in his first game in the conference. After which, they fell to 2\u20135 before the Holy Week break and they sent Nealy home. While looking for the right import, they almost got one through former [[Los Angeles Clippers]] forward [[Ryan Humphrey]] but he exceeded the height limit of 6'6 (he was listed 6'8). After the break, they came back strong with a win over Rain or Shine 94\u201389 despite an All Filipino lineup. To beef up their lineup, they acquired [[Cyrus Baguio]] and [[Homer Se]] from the [[Burger King Whoppers]] in a 3-way trade including Purefoods. After weeks of trying to find an import, they finally signed former [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] swingman [[David Noel]] who was listed as 6'5\" to further boost their depth as they try go deeper in the eliminations. Noel made an impressive debut with a triple double (22 pts, 17 rebs, 10 assts) in a 100\u201394 win over Burger King. Noel also displayed his athleticism by showing his high-flying skills in the 2009 PBA Slam Dunk Contest besting co-imports Gabe Freeman and Anthony Johnson to win the Imports category and [[Gabe Norwood]] to win it overall joining [[Paul Artadi]] who won the Obstacle Challenge earlier as the Kings won two of the three events. His dunks included a [[Michael Jordan]] rock the cradle dunk, a tossed windmill, and a backflip then 360 dunk that gave him a perfect 100 from the judges including US Ambassador [[Kristie Kenney]], and due to the fans request, he did a familiar [[Julius Erving]] foul line takeoff to cap the contest. In the main event of the evening which is the All-star Game between the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Powerade Team Pilipinas]] and the Import laced PBA All-stars, Noel again won the All-star game MVP as the All-stars defeated the Nationals 97\u201389.\n\nAs of this moment, the Kings are 8\u20131 with Noel as their import and they clinched a semifinal berth in the Conference along with the [[San Miguel Beermen]] as they pounded the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] 114\u201371.\n\nThe Kings were without high-scoring [[Mark Caguioa]] who was still recuperating from an injury in the United States. Caguioa, one of the prolific scorers in the league, did not play in the previous conference and his absence hurt the team's campaign. [[Junthy Valenzuela]] is also on the injured list.\n\n===2009\u201310===\n\n[[Image:MillerDavid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Willie Miller was traded to Ginebra in exchange of [[Cyrus Baguio]].]]\nIn preparation for the 35th season, Ginebra was included in a three-way trade with [[Barako Bull Energy|Burger King]] and [[B-Meg Derby Ace Llamados|Purefoods]].

On other reports, Ginebra coach [[Jong Uichico]] confirmed that they signed [[Eric Menk]] to a one-year contract extension for the Kings. Ginebra then released guard [[Chico Lanete]] and was later signed by the [[Barako Bull Energy|Burger King Whoppers]]. Prior to this release, they signed [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters]] 18th overall pick [[Kevin White (basketball)|Kevin White]] to a one-year deal.\n\nIn the Fiesta Conference, [[Rudy Hatfield]] came back to the country and signed a one-year contract with Ginebra. During the mid-conference, Ginebra acquired [[Yancy de Ocampo]] and a 2010 second-round draft pick from the [[Barako Bull Energy|Burger King Whoppers]] in exchange for [[Rich Alvarez]] and [[Doug Kramer]] and acquired the former Metropolitan Basketball Association MVP, [[John Ferriols]], who officially became an unrestricted free agent after being on the reserved list by the [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Aces]]. Due to lack of impressive point guards in their line-up, they traded high-flying [[Cyrus Baguio]] to the Alaska Aces and got the two-time MVP [[Willie Miller (basketball)|Willie Miller]]. Ginebra also traded [[Billy Mamaril]] to Air21 Express for [[Mike Cortez]] in the latter part of the conference.\n\nThe Kings' first import was Awvee Storey but he was then replaced by [[Mildon Ambres]] because of his inconsistencies. Ambres' performance was also not far from Storey's output; the team again made an import change. Denham Brown, a Seattle SuperSonics draftee, and a standout from the NBDL squad Iowa Energy, also struggled in five games when he played for the team during the last round of the eliminations.\n\nGinebra looked for winning combinations with the new players in their lineup. But, they still failed to secure a playoff berth for the semifinals. Being tied with the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters|Elasto Painters]], they played for one-game playoff for the last quarterfinals berth. The result was, the Kings defeated Rain or Shine, 115\u201388, in the lopsided win. Barangay Ginebra then renewed its historic battle with fourth-seeded Alaska Aces in the quarterfinals. This was a rematch between the two teams that tangled in the semifinals of the 2009 Philippine Cup. Alaska took a 2\u20130 lead. Diamon Simpson powered his way to a 20\u201320 game in the first game and Barangay Ginebra as the Aces topped the Kings, 76\u201372, in the opener of this quarterfinals. In game 2 Alaska showed poise at crunch time. The Aces came up with big plays down the stretch while the Kings could not, enabling the Aces to escape with an 84\u201382 win. Simpson capped a 30-point game with his 17th rebound that sealed the game just before the final buzzer. [[Eric Menk]] and import Chris Daniels provided scoring but their backcourt were again invisible, with [[Mark Caguioa]], [[Willie Miller]], [[Mike Cortez]], and [[Jayjay Helterbrand]] struggling in the game. In game 3 Ginebra came with a breakthrough win that fanned the hopes of the team. Not one but several Kings heeded the call and resulted in a 91\u201387 win over the Alaska Aces that kept the Kings' hope for the quarterfinals series. [[J.C. Intal]], who came off the bench exploded for 20 points, delivering what Mark Caguioa and Wille Mller could not while providing both inspiration and boost to the team's cause of eluding Alaska's broom. The Kings forced a rubber match when they got balanced scoring from their roster with a 94\u201390 win over Alaska in Game 4. J.C. Intal and [[Ronald Tubid]] hit consecutive three-pointers in the final three minutes while [[Sunday Salvacion]] came through with the game-sealing free throws with 2.6 seconds left in Game 4. Ginebra failed to win the quarterfinal series with a heartbreaking 91\u201393 loss with Aces. In game 5, [[LA Tenorio|Tenorio]] drilled a difficult triple at the buzzer which seemed enough to propel the Aces to a victory and erected a six-point lead, 90\u201384, with just 2:15 left in the match. Willie Miller scored on a layup off a broken play as Ginebra cut the Alaska lead to four 90\u201386 with 1:27 to go in the game. Miller then followed up a missed layup by his teammate to push Ginebra even closer, 90\u201388, with 31 seconds left. Eric Menk then intercepted a long pass by Simpson, grabbing the ball at midcourt then zipped the ball over to an open [[Jayjay Helterbrand]] who drilled a three-pointer as the Kings pulled ahead of Alaska, 90\u201391, with 28 seconds left. But Ginebra, unable to pull a tough defensive play, when Diamon Simpson scored from underneath to push Alaska ahead for good, 92\u201391, with just 5 seconds left to play. [[Cyrus Baguio]] then double-teamed an attacking Eric Menk and stole the ball from Menk that finalized the score on a split from the line, 93\u201391.\n\n===2010\u201311===\n\nTwo-time Most Valuable Player [[Willie Miller (basketball)|Willie Miller]] signed a two-year contract with the Kings. [[Billy Mamaril]] then returned to Ginebra after a stint with Air21 in exchange for a future draft pick.\n\nThree-time champion coach [[Siot Tanquingcen]], rejoined the coaching staff of the Kings.\n\nTo start building its future, with 11 players who were age 30 and over, Ginebra picked three rookies. They drafted 2009 NCAA season MVP [[John Wilson (basketball)|John Wilson]] from [[Jose Rizal University]] and 2009 NCAA Finals MVP [[Jimbo Aquino]] from [[San Sebastian College]] in the first round and [[University of the East|University of the East's]] [[Robert Labagala]] in the second round of the [[2010 PBA draft]]. They also released [[Paolo Bugia]], [[John Ferriols]], Kevin White and [[Junjun Cabatu]] and traded [[Sunday Salvacion]] to [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000\u201311)|Barako Bull]] for a future first round draft pick. They signed its three rookies after a week, giving Ginebra a mixture of youth and experienced backcourt. Wilson and Aquino were given similar two-year contracts worth P5.7 million, while Labagala got a one-year deal worth P800,000. On July 18, 2011, Miller was traded to Air21 in exchange for Ni\u00f1o Canaleta and 2012 future draft pick.\n\n===2011\u20132012 season===\n\n[[File:Robert Jaworski retired jersey banner.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Robert Jaworski]]'s retired jersey banner at the rafters of the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] during the retirement ceremonies.]]\nAfter a lackluster previous season, assistant coach Tanquingcen was named co-head coach of Ginebra, who coached alongside Uichico as head coach. After the news that Hatfield left the Kings due to personal matters, the team selected [[Reil Cervantes]] and [[James Martinez (basketball)|James Martinez]] in the [[2011 PBA draft]], but only kept Cervantes due to the guard heavy roster. Helterbrand signed only a one&nbsp;\u2013 conference contract extension, due to his desire to find out if he \"still had it\" and if he does not, he announced that he would retire after the conference.\n\nGinebra drew flak that season for starting the younger, inexperienced guards such as Wilson and Labagala instead of holdovers Caguioa and Helterbrand, a move intended by Tanquingcen to speed up the development of the younger guns of Ginebra.  Because of that, the Kings managed to barely escape two rival teams successively, as well as experience a two-game losing streak right after.\n\nOn November 16, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] commissioner [[Chito Salud]] approved a trade that sent [[Allein Maliksi]] and former Rookie of the Year [[Rico Maierhofer]] to Ginebra, while [[Jimbo Aquino]] and 2013 1st round pick of Ginebra will be given to [[Barako Bull Energy]], and 2002 1st overall pick [[Yancy de Ocampo]] and the 2012 2nd round pick of Ginebra will go to [[B-Meg Llamados]].\n\nGinebra finished fifth in the [[2011-12 PBA Philippine Cup|2011-12 Philippine Cup]] eliminations with a 9\u20135 record. They entered the quarterfinals but they were defeated by Rain or Shine in a best-of-three series.\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Uichico resigned from the San Miguel Corporation to become one of the assistant coaches of the [[Smart Gilas]] national team. On The same month, Ginebra acquired, [[Kerby Raymundo]] (from B-Meg) for [[JC Intal]], and [[Dylan Ababou]] (from Barako Bull) for guard/forward [[Ronald Tubid]] and forward Cervantes. They also reacquired veteran [[Rudy Hatfield]] and brought back old import, Alexander in the [[2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup|2012 Commissioner's Cup]] but after three games, the team replaced him with NBA veteran [[Jackson Vroman]] the team won the playoff for 2nd place in semifinals berth. Caguioa suffered a scary eye injury on that game. Ginebra failed to advance in finals, bowing to B-Meg in semifinal series (4\u20131).\n\nIn the season-ending [[2012 PBA Governors' Cup|Governors' Cup]], Caguioa returned to play and wore a protective glasses during the game. The team hired import Cedric Bozeman, and led the team to semifinals round with 5\u20134 standing in the eliminations.\n\nThe conference was highlighted with the retirement of Jaworski's #7 jersey on July 8, before the semifinal game between Ginebra and Petron Blaze. However, the team failed again to advance in finals in a heartbreaking loss to the Llamados during the one-game playoff for the 2nd finals berth.\n\nCaguioa was named Best Player of the Conference for the [[2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup|2012 Commissioner's]] and [[2012 PBA Governors' Cup|Governors' Cup]].

Apparently, Toyota's players were sold to new team Beer Hausen. Jaworski, in defiance, refused to play for Beer Hausen and joined Ginebra. The franchise sell out was the final straw in the 2-year silent feud of Jaworski and Fernandez within Toyota. It finally exploded into a war between the two. However, in the [[1989 PBA season|1989]] All-Star Game, Jaworski and Fernandez were teammates for the Veterans. In the final seconds, with the game tied, Jaworski's pass to Fernandez led to the Veterans escaping a 132\u2013130 win against the Rookies-Sophomores-Juniors team in the inaugural All-Star Game. Afterwards, Jaworski and Fernadez shook hands to the delight of the capacity crowd at the Philsports Arena, which signalled the reconciliation between the two legends.\n* On May 15, 1990, Shell Rimula X defeated A\u00f1ejo Rum 65, 4\u20132 to win the 1990 PBA 1st Conference title. However, it sparked a controversy in the sixth and final game of the series when the whole A\u00f1ejo team walked out with still 2:52 left in the second quarter in favor of the Oilers, 62-47. Back-to-back technical fouls were slapped by referee Rudy Hines on Rey Cuenco led to the walkout. Jaworski and team manager Ber Navarro refused to return to the court, which resulted in the forfeiture of the game, and the championship to Shell. Two days later, the league fined A\u00f1ejo a whopping 550,000 [[Philippine peso|pesos]], the biggest in league history. It was the second time that a forfeiture happened in a PBA Finals series since [[Crispa Redmanizers|Crispa]] in Game four of the 1975 series against rival [[Toyota Basketball Team|Toyota]].\n* Jaworski resigned as player-coach of the team after the [[1998 PBA season|1998]] season due to misunderstandings with the management of [[San Miguel Corporation]]. It is claimed that the former Philippines senator was frustrated over the team's acquisition of [[Allan Caidic]] as a player-assistant coach from San Miguel without first getting input from Jaworski.\n* On May 17, 1999, a bench-clearing brawl ensued during Game 2 of the All-Filipino Cup semifinals series against [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Formula Shell]]. A total of PhP 235,000 was slapped on 16 players and one official from both teams. Shell's Jay Mendoza was fined PhP 40,000, while Ginebra players Noli Locsin, Elmer Lago, Cris Bolado and Boy Valera were fined PhP 20,000 each.\n* In the 2005 PBA Philippine Cup Finals, Barangay Ginebra was awarded the winner of the first game of the series, after Finals opponent [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Talk 'N Text Phone Pals]] fielded the suspended [[Asi Taulava]]. With documents of his Filipino blood still questionable, the Phone Pals used the 6\u20139 center in their victory. The Kings filed a protest prior to the start of the game. Two days later, then-PBA Commissioner [[Noli Eala]] announced the forfeiture of Talk 'N Text's Game One win.\n\n==Legacy==\n* [[Gary Granada]], a well-known composer and singer in the Philippines, composed numerous songs about the Kings; ''\"Ginebrang Ginebra\", \"[[Kapag Nananalo ang Ginebra]]\"'' (When Ginebra Wins) sung by [[Bayang Barrios]], ''Pag Natatalo ang Ginebra'' (When Ginebra Loses), sung by himself.<ref>[http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/bayang-barrios-gary-granada-pag-nananalo-ang-ginebra-reprise Gary Granada, Bayang Barrios reprise classic Ginebra anthem to celebrate end to dry spell], spin.ph, October 20, 2016</ref> A different rendition of the song was made when Gordon's Gin won the [[1997 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals]] entitled \"'Nang Maging Champion ang Ginebra\". The song was revived by Maria Gracia Gonzales, a Barangay Ginebra fan and updated its lyrics, drawing inspiration from the team's victory in Game 2 of the [[2016 PBA Governors' Cup Finals|2016 Governors' Cup Finals]]. A video was posted by Gonzales in her Facebook account and garnered more than 800,000 views, 19,000 likes and 33,000 shares.<ref>[http://www.spin.ph/basketball/pba/news/ginebra-song-gary-granada-maria-gracia-gonzales-updated-lyrics-viral-video Ginebra's Game Two win inspires fan to come up with updated version of Gary Granada song], Ruben Terrado, spin.ph, October 11, 2016.</ref> She also performed the song during halftime of Game 5 of the championship series.\n\n==Current roster==\n{{Main|Barangay Ginebra San Miguel all-time roster}}\n{{Barangay Ginebra San Miguel roster}}\n\n==Season-by-season records==\n{{Main|List of Barangay Ginebra San Miguel seasons}}\n:''Records from the [[2019 PBA season]]:''\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]]. \n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|Scheduled]] Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life. Today anyone whose forefathers belonged to ST/SC community gets the benefits of reservation irrespective of his socioeconomic status. Originally reservation was only given to SCs and STs but was later extended to OBCs in 1987 after the implementation of the [[Mandal Commission]] report.\n\nIt is observed that even after 70 years of reservation the backward classes haven't been benefitted the way they should have been and reservation keeps getting extended after every 10 years. One of the major reasons for this is no income cap on ST/SC reservations unlike OBC and EWS reservations where there is an income cap so that once a person is benefitted by reservation and is capable of earning a livelihood, he is no longer entitled to reservation.\nAs there is no concept of creamy layer in ST/SC reservations, even the son, grandson and great grand son of any other class A officer gets the benefits of reservation who himself got reservation. So the benefits get siphoned off by the effluent ST/SC's and are not able to percolate to the lower strata. Even the supreme court has directed the central government to introduce creamy layer concept in ST/SC reservation, but this is not possible because of vote bank politics. So reservation is necessary in a country like India but rules for availing it should be changed for the overall development of people of backward classes.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are several groups who get reservations in India.\n\n* The first are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] These communities were variously seen as at the bottom or \"underneath\" the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in South Asia, below even the ''Sudra'' varna. These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi|Adivasis]], and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class|Other Backward Classes]]. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possiblity for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 14(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats.

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]]. \n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|Scheduled]] Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life. Today anyone whose forefathers belonged to ST/SC community gets the benefits of reservation irrespective of his socioeconomic status. Originally reservation was only given to SCs and STs but was later extended to OBCs in 1987 after the implementation of the [[Mandal Commission]] report.\n\nIt is observed that even after 70 years of reservation the backward classes haven't been benefitted the way they should have been and reservation keeps getting extended after every 10 years. One of the major reasons for this is no income cap on ST/SC reservations unlike OBC and EWS reservations where there is an income cap so that once a person is benefitted by reservation and is capable of earning a livelihood, he is no longer entitled to reservation.\nAs there is no concept of creamy layer in ST/SC reservations, even the son, grandson and great grand son of any other class A officer gets the benefits of reservation who himself got reservation. So the benefits get siphoned off by the effluent ST/SC's and are not able to percolate to the lower strata. Even the supreme court has directed the central government to introduce creamy layer concept in ST/SC reservation, but this is not possible because of vote bank politics. So reservation is necessary in a country like India but rules for availing it should be changed for the overall development of people of backward classes.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are several groups who get reservations in India.\n\n* The first are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]], better known as [[Dalit|Dalits]]. These communities were variously seen as at the bottom or \"underneath\" the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in South Asia, below even the ''Sudra'' varna. These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi|Adivasis]], and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class|Other Backward Classes]]. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possiblity for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 14(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.

In the late 19th century, peerages began to be awarded to industrialists with increasing frequency. Well-substantiated allegations that titles were sold during [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[Lloyd George ministry|premiership]] led to the passing of the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]]. In the second half of the 20th century the granting of hereditary [[peerages]], other than to members of the [[Royal Family]], virtually ceased, giving way to [[life peer]]ages, which have been granted since the passing of the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]]. They are given to a wide range of individuals on the recommendation of the leaders of the major British political parties, including opposition parties.\n\nIn May 1998, the then Chairman of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee, former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Cabinet Minister [[Francis Pym|Lord Pym]], told a House of Commons Select Committee that the committee considered a political donation a point in a nominee's favour as it indicated involvement in public life, and that the nominee had \"put their money where his mouth is\". The [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]] was established in 2000 to check the suitability of those nominated for an honour.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, a list of 28 people nominated for [[Life peerage|working peerages]] was prepared. The list contained 11 [[British Labour party|Labour]] nominees, eight [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], five [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], three members of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and one member of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. The list was referred to the Appointments Commission in the usual way. Publication of the list was delayed and stories began to appear in the press stating that the Commission had concerns about some of those nominated on grounds of their large donations to political parties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1862176,00.html |title=Sleaze row as election donors get peerages|work=The Times|date=8 November 2005 | location=London | first=Greg | last=Hurst | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Some of the Labour peers appointed became known as [[Tony's Cronies]].

Dromey feared he would be blamed for the debts by an inquiry organised by [[10 Downing Street]] (''Tribune'', 24 March 2006, p.&nbsp;5). Dromey's announcement created much media interest to which Blair had to respond to at his monthly press conference the next day.

First, to what degree was there a tacit or implied relationship between the large scale donors and their subsequent recognition via the [[British honours system|honours system]]? Second, the rules on party funding (applicable to all political parties in the UK) require that anyone donating \u00a35,000 or more must be named \u2013 but loans of any amount do not have to be declared provided they are made on commercial terms. This loophole raises accusations of undue secrecy and potentially calls into question the probity of those involved in procurement and handling of such large and anonymous sums, particularly when the elected party treasurer was unaware of the existence of the loans.\n\nLord Levy, a close friend of Tony Blair (who was the Prime Minister's personal envoy to the Middle East, as well as tennis partner), had raised funds for Labour and was identified in the press as a key figure in arranging the loans and on 17 March 2006 it was announced that the [[Public Administration Select Committee]] of the House of Commons had invited him to give evidence on political financing.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4816692.stm | title = Lord Levy: Labour's fundraiser | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 17 March 2006 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> Committee chairman [[Anthony Wayland Wright|Tony Wright]] said:\n\n:\"With continuing speculation about whether the system of scrutiny is sufficiently robust and as part of our wider inquiry into current standards of probity in public life, we will be hearing from those charged with scrutinising nominations to ensure that there are robust safeguards against honours for sale.\"\n\nAnother issue was repayment: the Labour Party owed about \u00a314&nbsp;m before the election. The interest on the loans amounted to \u00a3900,000 a year and some of the loans had to be repaid within months, either through further borrowing or gifts. In these circumstances, one unanswered question concerned why Lord Levy asked for loans rather than gifts.\n\nIt was disclosed on 25 March 2006 that the only persons privy to details of the loans were Tony Blair, Lord Levy and [[Matt Carter (politician)|Matt Carter]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article353512.ece |title=Developer's tower block approved after \u00a3200,000 donation to Labour |newspaper=The Independent |date=25 March 2006 |location=London |first1=Colin |last1=Brown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204093935/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/developers-tower-block-approved-after-163200000-donation-to-labour-471358.html |archivedate=4 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2006 it was revealed that [[Scotland Yard]] had requested that parliament halt the [[Public Administration Select Committee]] hearing with four of the peerage nominees, Sir David Garrard, Sir Gulam Noon, and Chai Patel, Barry Townsley as it could prejudice the criminal investigation.

On 20 April 2005 Noon had agreed to lend Labour \u00a3250,000 on commercial terms, which he did on 28 April. Noon had originally offered to make a donation of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a375,000 but Levy wanted \u00a31&nbsp;m. They then negotiated a loan. A letter sent to Sir Gulam at this time by Labour said that his \u00a3250,000 loan was not \"reportable\" under relevant legislation. On 3 October 2006, Sir Gulam was informed by a Labour official that the prime minister was nominating him for a peerage. On 4 October 2006, Sir Gulam received the nomination forms for joining the House of Lords. These asked him to list his contributions to Labour. Sir Gulam gave the papers to his accountant, who put down the \u00a3250,000 on the form along with just over \u00a3220,000 of straight donations he had made since 2000. On 5 October 2006 Lord Levy told Sir Gulam that he need not have included the \u00a3250,000 on the papers sent to the Lords Appointments Commission, because it was not a donation. Sir Gulam retrieved the papers and submitted a revised document that made no mention of the \u00a3250,000. In March 2006, the Lords Appointments Commission found out about the loan. Its chairman, Lord Stevenson, then wrote to the prime minister asking that Sir Gulam's nomination for a peerage be withdrawn.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5167140.stm| title =Levy's advice to donor revealed | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 10 July 2006  | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Labour Party loans ===\nOn 20 March 2006 the Labour Party issued the full list of 12 lenders, together with the sums involved:<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4826680.stm | title =Labour reveals secret loans list | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 20 March 2006  | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n::[[Rod Aldridge]] \u2013 \u00a31&nbsp;million \u2013 former Executive Chairman of [[Capita]]\n::[[Richard Caring]] \u2013 \u00a32&nbsp;million \u2013 owner of [[The Ivy]], London\n::Gordon Crawford \u2013 \u00a3500,000 \u2013 Chairman of London Bridge Software\n::[[Sir Christopher Evans]] \u2013 \u00a31&nbsp;million \u2013 Founder of Merlin Biosciences\n::[[David Garrard (property developer)|Sir David Garrard]] \u2013 \u00a32.3&nbsp;million\n::[[Nigel Morris]] \u2013 \u00a31&nbsp;million \u2013 co-Founder of [[Capital One]] and Director of [[The Economist Group]]\n::[[Gulam Noon|Sir Gulam Noon]] \u2013 \u00a3250,000 \u2013 Chairman of Noon Products Ltd\n::[[Chai Patel]] \u2013 \u00a31.5&nbsp;million\n::[[Andrew Rosenfeld]] \u2013 \u00a31&nbsp;million \u2013 Chairman of [[Minerva plc]]\n::[[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville]] \u2013 \u00a32&nbsp;million \u2013 Government Minister\n::[[Barry Townsley]] \u2013 \u00a31&nbsp;million \u2013 Chairman of Insinger Townsley\n::Derek Tullett \u2013 \u00a3400,000 \u2013\n\n::Total: \u00a313,950,000\n\nOne of the lenders, [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury of Turville]] was, until November 2006, a [[government minister]].

He said the Lib Dems received loans from three people in the period before the 2005 General Election and had declared their names and the sums lent. He urged transparency on funding, and suggested a \u00a350,000 cap on donations by individuals and a reduction in maximum permitted party election spending from \u00a320&nbsp;m to \u00a315&nbsp;m:<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4824340.stm | title = Sir Menzies urges loans openness | publisher = BBC | date = 20 March 2006  | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n:\"There should be no secret loans of any kind, and if the lord chancellor is proposing that in legislation currently before Parliament, that's something we will most certainly support.\"\n\n==Previous instances==\nThe expression \"cash for peerages\" has a long history. Titles have constantly been granted to court favourites and allies. [[James I of England|James I]] was more overt; he created the title of [[baronet]] and sold them for \u00a31,500 each to raise money for his war in Ireland.\n\nIn the 1920s [[David Lloyd George]] was involved in a barely concealed \"cash for patronage\" scandal managed by [[Maundy Gregory]], which resulted in the 1925 Act which barred this (purchase of peerages had not previously been illegal).\n\nIn 1976 [[Harold Wilson]]'s resignation honours list was similarly embroiled in what became known as the [[1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|\"Lavender List\"]] (supposedly hand-written on lavender paper by [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]]). This, though widely deemed to include some unsuitable and unsalubrious nominees, rewarded Wilson's friends and carried no suggestion of overt reward for money \u2013 given or loaned. [[Joseph Kagan, Baron Kagan|Lord Kagan]], ennobled in the Lavender List, was convicted of fraud in 1980 \u2013 for some years he had been funding Harold Wilson's Leader's office. [[Sir Eric Miller]], knighted in the Lavender List, committed suicide in 1977 while under investigation for fraud; he too had helped fund Harold Wilson's Leader's office.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]] had some justifiable claim to a peerage as a Canadian and later British publisher. As even his company history observes, \"Roy had noted that all proprietors of newspapers seemed to become members of the House of Lords. He had also noted this was emphatically 'a good thing'\" and he showed himself ready to do whatever was required to achieve this goal, believing at first that it could be a simple open purchase but moving on to explicit lobbying of prime ministers.

In the late 19th century, peerages began to be awarded to industrialists with increasing frequency. Well-substantiated allegations that titles were sold during [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[Lloyd George ministry|premiership]] led to the passing of the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]]. In the second half of the 20th century the granting of hereditary [[peerages]], other than to members of the [[Royal Family]], virtually ceased, giving way to [[life peer]]ages, which have been granted since the passing of the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]]. They are given to a wide range of individuals on the recommendation of the leaders of the major British political parties, including opposition parties.\n\nIn May 1998, the then Chairman of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee, former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Cabinet Minister [[Francis Pym|Lord Pym]], told a House of Commons Select Committee that the committee considered a political donation a point in a nominee's favour as it indicated involvement in public life, and that the nominee had \"put their money where his mouth is\". The [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]] was established in 2000 to check the suitability of those nominated for an honour.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, a list of 28 people nominated for [[Life peerage|working peerages]] was prepared. The list contained 11 [[British Labour party|Labour]] nominees, eight [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], five [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], three members of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and one member of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. The list was referred to the Appointments Commission in the usual way. Publication of the list was delayed and stories began to appear in the press stating that the Commission had concerns about some of those nominated on grounds of their large donations to political parties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1862176,00.html |title=Sleaze row as election donors get peerages|work=The Times|date=8 November 2005 | location=London | first=Greg | last=Hurst | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Some of the Labour peers appointed became known as [[Tony's Cronies]].

Dromey feared he would be blamed for the debts by an inquiry organised by [[10 Downing Street]] (''Tribune'', 24 March 2006, p.&nbsp;5).

First, to what degree was there a tacit or implied relationship between the large scale donors and their subsequent recognition via the [[British honours system|honours system]]? Second, the rules on party funding (applicable to all political parties in the UK) require that anyone donating \u00a35,000 or more must be named \u2013 but loans of any amount do not have to be declared provided they are made on commercial terms. This loophole raises accusations of undue secrecy and potentially calls into question the probity of those involved in procurement and handling of such large and anonymous sums, particularly when the elected party treasurer was unaware of the existence of the loans.\n\nLord Levy, a close friend of Tony Blair (who was the Prime Minister's personal envoy to the Middle East, as well as tennis partner), had raised funds for Labour and was identified in the press as a key figure in arranging the loans and on 17 March 2006 it was announced that the [[Public Administration Select Committee]] of the House of Commons had invited him to give evidence on political financing.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4816692.stm | title = Lord Levy: Labour's fundraiser | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 17 March 2006 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> Committee chairman [[Anthony Wayland Wright|Tony Wright]] said:\n\n:\"With continuing speculation about whether the system of scrutiny is sufficiently robust and as part of our wider inquiry into current standards of probity in public life, we will be hearing from those charged with scrutinising nominations to ensure that there are robust safeguards against honours for sale.\"\n\nAnother issue was repayment: the Labour Party owed about \u00a314&nbsp;m before the election. The interest on the loans amounted to \u00a3900,000 a year and some of the loans had to be repaid within months, either through further borrowing or gifts. In these circumstances, one unanswered question concerned why Lord Levy asked for loans rather than gifts.\n\nIt was disclosed on 25 March 2006 that the only persons privy to details of the loans were Tony Blair, Lord Levy and [[Matt Carter (politician)|Matt Carter]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article353512.ece |title=Developer's tower block approved after \u00a3200,000 donation to Labour |newspaper=The Independent |date=25 March 2006 |location=London |first1=Colin |last1=Brown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204093935/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/developers-tower-block-approved-after-163200000-donation-to-labour-471358.html |archivedate=4 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2006 it was revealed that [[Scotland Yard]] had requested that parliament halt the [[Public Administration Select Committee]] hearing with four of the peerage nominees, Sir David Garrard, Sir Gulam Noon, and Chai Patel, Barry Townsley as it could prejudice the criminal investigation.

On 20 April 2005 Noon had agreed to lend Labour \u00a3250,000 on commercial terms, which he did on 28 April. Noon had originally offered to make a donation of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a375,000 but Levy wanted \u00a31&nbsp;m. They then negotiated a loan. A letter sent to Sir Gulam at this time by Labour said that his \u00a3250,000 loan was not \"reportable\" under relevant legislation. On 3 October 2006, Sir Gulam was informed by a Labour official that the prime minister was nominating him for a peerage. On 4 October 2006, Sir Gulam received the nomination forms for joining the House of Lords. These asked him to list his contributions to Labour. Sir Gulam gave the papers to his accountant, who put down the \u00a3250,000 on the form along with just over \u00a3220,000 of straight donations he had made since 2000. On 5 October 2006 Lord Levy told Sir Gulam that he need not have included the \u00a3250,000 on the papers sent to the Lords Appointments Commission, because it was not a donation. Sir Gulam retrieved the papers and submitted a revised document that made no mention of the \u00a3250,000. In March 2006, the Lords Appointments Commission found out about the loan.

He refused to give a guarantee that Labour had not given peerages for loans, saying \"I am bound to say not all the information possibly is out yet and we are still looking at it.\"\n\nPrescott said he favoured a change to state funding but also said he would not rule out the suggestion that private loans should be capped:<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4821702.stm | title = Prescott in the dark about loans | publisher = BBC | date = 19 March 2006 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> \"There's a kind of unhealthy approach to political financing in this country.

He told BBC One's ''[[The Politics Show]]'' he did not \"know anything\" about the firm or secret loans to the party.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4846090.stm | title = Prescott denies Labour loans link | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 26 March 2006  | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe said he had received the planning requirements for a skyscraper in London and the [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]] shopping centre in [[Croydon]] but felt the decision could be made locally. \"I passed it over to Croydon and City of London Corporation. They made the decision, not me. It's quite untrue to say there was a deal or I made the decision.\"\n\nOf Garrard and Rosenfeld he said, \"I don't think I have ever met them. I don't know who the companies are and I certainly don't know if they were giving money to the Labour Party. I am not a great one for circulating among businessmen. I just do my damn job and therefore I resent it when these implications are made. I have not made any money from politics for God's sake. But I am here doing what I can best in public service. My reputation is important to me. My politics is important to me.\"\n\n\"I make my mistakes from time to time and we have to be answerable to you guys but not when it's a lie,\" he added.\n\n====Lord Falconer of Thoroton====\nAmendments to the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006|Electoral Administration Act]] to make it a legal requirement that loans to political parties are made public in a similar way to donations were to be urgently considered by [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer of Thoroton]], then [[Lord Chancellor]] according to reports in March 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4823680.stm | title = Secret party loans to be banned | publisher = BBC | date = 20 March 2006  | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Conservative Party===\n\n====David Cameron====\n\"We've got to stop this perception that parties can somehow be bought by big donations either from very rich people, or trade unions, or businesses.\"\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] admitted that it has engaged in similar borrowing (but did not reveal any links to nominations for peerages). Such loans have been reported in party accounts though the annual accounts are not yet published for the period covering the 2005 general election.\n\nDavid Cameron's proposals are:\n:Ban on all loans unless from financial institutions on fully commercial terms\n:\u00a350,000 cap on donations\n:Tax relief on donations up to \u00a33,000\n:State funding of \u00a31.20 per vote won at general elections for parties with MPs, plus annual payment equal to 60p per vote\n:New commission to handle honours\n:General election party funds limited to \u00a315&nbsp;m\n\nThese proposals would also reduce the number of MPs from 650 to fewer than 600.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4827142.stm | title = Tories will not name key backers | publisher = BBC | date=20 March 2006 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Francis Maude====\nConservative Party chairman [[Francis Maude]] said he \"regretted\" accepting loans from abroad but insisted it had not broken the law. He said it had to pay back \u00a35m to lenders who wanted to remain anonymous including a number of foreign nationals.\n\n\"These loans represent a very small part of our financial backing \u2013 I wish we had not done so but we have and we have now set the record clear we have repaid those loans and the matter is perfectly clear,\" Mr Maude told [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. \"It would clearly have been better if we had not as things turn out but that's the way it is.\" He insisted the Tories had done nothing wrong and that Labour had been \"much less transparent about this whole process than we have.\"\n\nHe said he was \"very proud\" of the people who lent money to the Tories and insisted they had not supported the party out of \"self-interest\" because, he argued, it had not stood much of a chance of gaining power in recent years.\n\n===Liberal Democrats===\n\n====Sir Menzies Campbell====\nFormer [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Menzies Campbell|Sir Menzies Campbell]] said that his party had not nominated anyone for a peerage who had loaned it large sums. He said the Lib Dems received loans from three people in the period before the 2005 General Election and had declared their names and the sums lent. He urged transparency on funding, and suggested a \u00a350,000 cap on donations by individuals and a reduction in maximum permitted party election spending from \u00a320&nbsp;m to \u00a315&nbsp;m:<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4824340.stm | title = Sir Menzies urges loans openness | publisher = BBC | date = 20 March 2006  | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n:\"There should be no secret loans of any kind, and if the lord chancellor is proposing that in legislation currently before Parliament, that's something we will most certainly support.\"\n\n==Previous instances==\nThe expression \"cash for peerages\" has a long history. Titles have constantly been granted to court favourites and allies. [[James I of England|James I]] was more overt; he created the title of [[baronet]] and sold them for \u00a31,500 each to raise money for his war in Ireland.\n\nIn the 1920s [[David Lloyd George]] was involved in a barely concealed \"cash for patronage\" scandal managed by [[Maundy Gregory]], which resulted in the 1925 Act which barred this (purchase of peerages had not previously been illegal).\n\nIn 1976 [[Harold Wilson]]'s resignation honours list was similarly embroiled in what became known as the [[1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|\"Lavender List\"]] (supposedly hand-written on lavender paper by [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]]). This, though widely deemed to include some unsuitable and unsalubrious nominees, rewarded Wilson's friends and carried no suggestion of overt reward for money \u2013 given or loaned. [[Joseph Kagan, Baron Kagan|Lord Kagan]], ennobled in the Lavender List, was convicted of fraud in 1980 \u2013 for some years he had been funding Harold Wilson's Leader's office. [[Sir Eric Miller]], knighted in the Lavender List, committed suicide in 1977 while under investigation for fraud; he too had helped fund Harold Wilson's Leader's office.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]] had some justifiable claim to a peerage as a Canadian and later British publisher. As even his company history observes, \"Roy had noted that all proprietors of newspapers seemed to become members of the House of Lords. He had also noted this was emphatically 'a good thing'\" and he showed himself ready to do whatever was required to achieve this goal, believing at first that it could be a simple open purchase but moving on to explicit lobbying of prime ministers. He contributed money to charitable bodies which were deemed to improve his chances. Eventually, having bought ''[[The Scotsman]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and later ''The Times'', he became sufficiently important to [[Harold Wilson]] that he was given a hereditary peerage as [[Baron Thomson of Fleet]].\n\nAs recently as 2004 the issue of large donations to a political party being linked to the award of a peerage arose when [[Paul Drayson, Baron Drayson|Paul Drayson]] donated \u00a3555,000 to the Labour Party. His company, [[Powderject]] (now part of [[Novartis]]), had also received a valuable government contract to make vaccines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=315315&in_page_id=1770 |title=Has Labour sleaze reached a new low?|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=24 August 2004 | location=London}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=October 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lords Reform|Reform of the House of Lords]]\n*[[Cash-for-questions affair]]\n*[[Cash for Influence (disambiguation)|Cash for Influence]]\n*[[Political funding in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[David Abrahams (Labour party donor)]]\n*[[Tony's Cronies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2580264,00.html 'Loans for Honours' Affair: Media demand explanation about Tony Blair's second police interview \u2013 Greg Hurst], ''The Times'', 2 February 2007.\n* [https://cashhomebuyersdallas.com Cash For Houses]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4828094.stm Guide to peers and House of Lords]\n* [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/07/20/uk-britain-honours-chronology-idUKL2025030320070720?

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that can't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan, together with a friend.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

In a career lasting from 1981 to 2004, he is best known for his time playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He won 75 caps for the [[England national football team]], and is the country's second-most capped goalkeeper, after [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGkprs/GkprsMstApps.html |title=England's Goalkeepers in Most Appearance Order |work=England Football Online}}</ref> In 1997, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to football.\n\nThe peak of Seaman's career was during his period as Arsenal and England goalkeeper in the 1990s and early 2000s. During his time at Arsenal he won three league championships (1991, 1998, 2002), four [[FA Cup]]s (1993, 1998, 2002, 2003), the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] in 1994. During this time he also played for England in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. As well as Arsenal, he also played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as making appearances in the [[Football League]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHis save from [[Paul Peschisolido]] of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup]] was described as one of the best ever. Notable lows came with two costly errors, both from long-range efforts\u2014conceding a [[last-minute goal]] in the [[1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] to [[Nayim]] and conceding to a [[Ronaldinho]] free-kick in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace |first=Sam |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2371241/Seaman-calls-time-on-career.html |title=Seaman calls time on career |publisher=Telegraph |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2009-05-20 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/photo_galleries/3394471.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; Photo Galleries &#124; David Seaman's career in photos |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-01-13 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-career-meets-unsatisfying-conclusion-573082.html |title=Seaman's career meets unsatisfying conclusion&nbsp;\u2013 Premier League, Football |publisher=The Independent |date= 2004-01-14|accessdate=2009-05-20 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-7.-david-seaman |title=Gunners' Greatest Players&nbsp;\u2013 7.

He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nSeaman was born in [[Rotherham]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]<!-- not South Yorkshire, which didn't exist until 11 years after Seaman's birth -->. He attended [[Kimberworth Comprehensive School]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article130783.ece ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> He began his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the club he supported as a boy. However (much to his disappointment), he was not wanted by then-manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer born 1948)|Eddie Gray]], who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Division 4 club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a34,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.\n\nJust over two years later, in October 1984, [[Football League Championship|Second Division]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] paid \u00a3100,000 for Seaman's services. They ended up winning [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] at the end of that season, but were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to Division Two, however.\n\nIn August 1986, Seaman moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for \u00a3225,000. Playing in a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he earned his first England cap, which came under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Arsenal double-winner (of 1971) [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], who was to work with him for more than a decade.\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nIn 1990, long before the current [[transfer window]] system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper [[John Lukic]] heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] came back for Seaman, with \u00a31.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper)<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Tim |date=13 May 2003 |title=Seaman's standing unfairly undermined by rare mistakes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-standing-unfairly-undermined-by-rare-mistakes-590470.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.\n\nSeaman's time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club's history. The [[1990\u201391 Arsenal F.C. season|1990\u201391 season]] saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the [[List of English football champions|league title]].\n\nArsenal won both the [[1992\u201393 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. Arsenal began their victorious League Cup campaign against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and after two legs the game went to a penalty shootout. Seaman saved three of the four Millwall penalties from [[Malcolm Allen (footballer)|Malcolm Allen]], [[Jon Goodman]] and [[Colin Cooper]] to help his side progress.<ref>{{cite news |last=Haylett |first=Trevor |date=8 October 1992 |title=Football / Coca-Cola Cup: Seaman shines in shoot-out to deny Millwall: Winterburn hurt by coin thrower |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-coca-cola-cup-seaman-shines-in-shoot-out-to-deny-millwall-winterburn-hurt-by-coin-thrower-1556223.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, George Graham was sacked, and Arsenal came close to becoming the first club to retain the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], with Seaman earning a reputation as a [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]]-saving specialist after saving from [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] and [[Attilio Lombardo]] in Arsenal's semi-final [[Penalty shootout|shoot-out]] against [[U.C.

Wenger rated Seaman highly and in [[1997-98 Arsenal F.C. season|1998]], Seaman helped the team to the [[1997-98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[1997-98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1998-99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and lost in the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season Seaman managed to reach the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]], which Arsenal drew 0\u20130 with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], but lost on penalties.\n\nIn [[2001\u201302 Arsenal F.C. season|2002]], Seaman won the [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2001\u201302 FA Cup|FA Cup]] again to complete his second career double, although Arsenal's other goalkeepers [[Stuart Taylor (footballer born 1980)|Stuart Taylor]] (10 appearances) and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] (12 appearances) also won championship medals, due mainly to Seaman's absence through injuries. A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a [[Gareth Barry]] penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873883.stm\n|title=Arsenal see off Villa\n|publisher=BBC   \n|date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the [[2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]]\u2014Seaman's last at Arsenal\u2014ended on a high note. He began the season with saving a [[Freddie Kanoute]] penalty in a draw at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2210776.stm\n|title=Hammers hold Arsenal\n|publisher=BBC \n|date=24 August 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> In the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup|FA Cup]], he made a save against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]'s [[Paul Peschisolido]] in the semi-finals, which former Manchester United goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]], a pundit for the [[BBC]] on the day, dubbed \"the best save I've ever seen\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2944701.stm | title=Schmeichel leads Seaman praise | work=BBC Sport | date=2004-04-13 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> Arsenal were defending a 1\u20130 lead, when with less than ten minutes to go, Peschisolido had a header towards an apparently open goal from six yards out with Seaman seemingly stranded at the near post. However, the goalkeeper leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman's 1,000th professional career game. Seaman went on to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the team during the [[2003 FA Cup Final]] in the absence of injured [[Patrick Vieira]] and keep another clean sheet at the [[Millennium Stadium]] as they defeated [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] 1\u20130. His final act with Arsenal was to lift the FA Cup, which was his eighth major trophy with his team. Seaman played in goal for Arsenal more times than anyone else, and is second after [[Ray Parlour]] in the all-time [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] appearances chart for Arsenal, with 325 to his name. In June 2008 he was voted seventh in the list of 50 Gunners' Greatest Players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-7.-david-seaman |title=Gunners' Greatest Players \u2013 7.

Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] \u2014 the man who had ousted him as England's first choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Paul Merson]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] approached Seaman, and later ex-[[Wales national football team|Wales]] goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] and [[Chris Woods]], to play in an [[FA Cup]] game at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] as their two first-choice keepers, [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Andy Oakes (footballer)|Andy Oakes]], were unavailable. However, Seaman was forced to turn this offer down, as it would have constituted a breach in the terms of his retirement insurance pay-out for his recurring shoulder injury.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ley |first=John |date=3 November 2005 |title=Seaman bid falls flat |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2367636/Seaman-bid-falls-flat.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nSeaman made his England debut in 1988 and appeared for the side in fifteen consecutive years, a national record, since equalled by [[Rio Ferdinand]].\n\nHe earned his first England cap under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Robson selected him as England's third-choice goalkeeper behind [[Peter Shilton]] and [[Chris Woods]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], but after arriving in Italy he had to pull out of the squad due to injury and was replaced by [[Dave Beasant]].\n\nSeaman remained a member of the England squad under new manager [[Graham Taylor]], although he was not selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]]. During qualification for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], Seaman played in the crucial game against the Netherlands, which England lost 2\u20130;<ref>{{cite news|last=Lovejoy |first=Joe |date=14 October 1993 |title=Football: Koeman leaves England in tatters: Referee condemned as Ronald Koeman escapes red card to break brave resistance with deft free-kick |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-koeman-leaves-england-in-tatters-referee-condemned-as-ronald-koeman-escapes-red-card-to-1510736.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> he also played in the final match against San Marino, in which [[Davide Gualtieri]] scored after 8.3 seconds before England recovered to win 7\u20131.

Seaman saved two spot-kicks in the tournament; the first a penalty in normal play from [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]'s [[Gary McAllister]] in a group match, while England were 1\u20130 up ([[Paul Gascoigne]] scored soon after to make it 2\u20130). Then, after England's quarter-final against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] ended scoreless, Seaman saved [[Miguel Angel Nadal]]'s kick in the shootout to knock Spain out of the tournament.

England went out on penalties, losing against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. [[Kevin Keegan]] selected him for [[UEFA Euro 2000]], where he started against both [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] but sustained an injury in his warm-up exercises for the third game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and was replaced by [[Nigel Martyn]]. England lost the match and went out in the first round.\n\nSeaman was part of [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]'s [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] squad, and played every game as England reached the quarter-finals, turning back a second-half offensive to shut out arch-rivals Argentina 1\u20130 in the group stage after English captain [[David Beckham]] scored a penalty. However, in the quarter-final against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], Seaman was caught off his line by [[Ronaldinho]]'s long-range free kick, as England lost 2\u20131; he blamed himself for the error.<ref>{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |date=21 June 2002 |title=Seaman says sorry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/england_v_brazil/newsid_2057000/2057696.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=11 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe result led to a debate about whether Seaman should remain England's number one.<ref>{{cite news |title=Time for Seaman to go? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/2214193.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2002 |accessdate=11 February 2007}}</ref> He remained England's first-choice goalkeeper until a [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004]] qualifier in October 2002 against [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]].

Whilst still a player, he acted in a cameo role in a [[BBC]] [[film]] based around the events of [[England national football team|England]]'s  successful Euro 96 tournament, starring [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Neil Morrissey]], entitled ''My Summer with Des''. He also became the [[spokesman]] for [[Yorkshire Tea]] during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced [[Gary Lineker]] as team captain on the television quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate [[Ian Wright]].\n\nIn December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in ''Strictly Ice Dancing'', an ice dance version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing [[Paul Gascoigne]]. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.\n\nIn late 2005 he had his trademark [[ponytail]] cut off on live television for charity, which ended negotiatory talks with such companies as L'Oreal who wanted to sponsor his hair as they had with [[David Ginola]]. He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place. He has also appeared on ''All Star [[Family Fortunes]]''.\n\nSeaman also hosts a \"Safe Hands\" charity golf event annually, and has released two football-themed [[DVD]]s entitled ''David Seaman's Goalkeeping Nightmares'' in 2003 and ''Jeepers Keepers'' in 2004. Seaman has also played in all six [[Soccer Aid]] matches for [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1131753/|title='Soccer Aid' (TV mini-series 2006)|website==IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew McNair |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/55285-soccer-aid-2008-a-real-problem-for-football |title=Soccer Aid 2008: A Real Problem For Football |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref><ref>[http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail_full_story.asp?news_id=1532 ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 ''The Lobbing of David Seaman'', a poem in [[ballad]] form by [[Murray Lachlan Young]] about Nayim's 1995 goal, was included in the radio programme ''The Loneliness of the Goalkeeper''.<ref>BBC Radio 4, broadcast 25 October 2008</ref> It began with these lines:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nAh, come all ye teenage goalkeepers\nAnd listen unto me,\nI'll tell you of a goalie\nWho went out to gay Paree;\nThe Gunners called him 'Safe Hands',\nDavid Seaman was his name,\nBut that lonely night in Paris\nWas his world consumed in flames....\n</poem>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn June 2012, Seaman joined [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]]  as goalkeeping coach for their [[2012\u201313 FA Cup]] campaign, as part of a television documentary following the club's attempt to play at [[Wembley Stadium]].

As well as Arsenal, he also played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], as well as making appearances in the [[Football League]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHis save from [[Paul Peschisolido]] of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2002\u201303 FA Cup]] was described as one of the best ever.

He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of [[Combined Counties League]] club [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nSeaman was born in [[Rotherham]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]<!-- not South Yorkshire, which didn't exist until 11 years after Seaman's birth -->. He attended [[Kimberworth Comprehensive School]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article130783.ece ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> He began his career at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the club he supported as a boy. However (much to his disappointment), he was not wanted by then-manager [[Eddie Gray (footballer born 1948)|Eddie Gray]], who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Division 4 club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a34,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.\n\nJust over two years later, in October 1984, [[Football League Championship|Second Division]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] paid \u00a3100,000 for Seaman's services. They ended up winning [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] at the end of that season, but were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to Division Two, however.\n\nIn August 1986, Seaman moved to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for \u00a3225,000. Playing in a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he earned his first England cap, which came under [[Bobby Robson]] in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Arsenal double-winner (of 1971) [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], who was to work with him for more than a decade.\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nIn 1990, long before the current [[transfer window]] system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper [[John Lukic]] heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] came back for Seaman, with \u00a31.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper)<ref>{{cite news |last=Rich |first=Tim |date=13 May 2003 |title=Seaman's standing unfairly undermined by rare mistakes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/seamans-standing-unfairly-undermined-by-rare-mistakes-590470.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.\n\nSeaman's time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club's history. The [[1990\u201391 Arsenal F.C. season|1990\u201391 season]] saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the [[List of English football champions|league title]].\n\nArsenal won both the [[1992\u201393 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[1992\u201393 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. Arsenal began their victorious League Cup campaign against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and after two legs the game went to a penalty shootout. Seaman saved three of the four Millwall penalties from [[Malcolm Allen (footballer)|Malcolm Allen]], [[Jon Goodman]] and [[Colin Cooper]] to help his side progress.<ref>{{cite news |last=Haylett |first=Trevor |date=8 October 1992 |title=Football / Coca-Cola Cup: Seaman shines in shoot-out to deny Millwall: Winterburn hurt by coin thrower |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-coca-cola-cup-seaman-shines-in-shoot-out-to-deny-millwall-winterburn-hurt-by-coin-thrower-1556223.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, George Graham was sacked, and Arsenal came close to becoming the first club to retain the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], with Seaman earning a reputation as a [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]]-saving specialist after saving from [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] and [[Attilio Lombardo]] in Arsenal's semi-final [[Penalty shootout|shoot-out]] against [[U.C.

Wenger rated Seaman highly and in [[1997-98 Arsenal F.C. season|1998]], Seaman helped the team to the [[1997-98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[1997-98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1998-99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998\u201399]], Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the [[1998\u201399 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and lost in the [[1998\u201399 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-finals to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season Seaman managed to reach the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]], which Arsenal drew 0\u20130 with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], but lost on penalties.\n\nIn [[2001\u201302 Arsenal F.C. season|2002]], Seaman won the [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2001\u201302 FA Cup|FA Cup]] again to complete his second career double, although Arsenal's other goalkeepers [[Stuart Taylor (footballer born 1980)|Stuart Taylor]] (10 appearances) and [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] (12 appearances) also won championship medals, due mainly to Seaman's absence through injuries. A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a [[Gareth Barry]] penalty as Arsenal won 2\u20131 at [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news \n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1873883.stm\n|title=Arsenal see off Villa\n|publisher=BBC   \n|date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the [[2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]]\u2014Seaman's last at Arsenal\u2014ended on a high note.

However, the goalkeeper leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman's 1,000th professional career game. Seaman went on to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] the team during the [[2003 FA Cup Final]] in the absence of injured [[Patrick Vieira]] and keep another clean sheet at the [[Millennium Stadium]] as they defeated [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] 1\u20130. His final act with Arsenal was to lift the FA Cup, which was his eighth major trophy with his team. Seaman played in goal for Arsenal more times than anyone else, and is second after [[Ray Parlour]] in the all-time [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] appearances chart for Arsenal, with 325 to his name.

Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] \u2014 the man who had ousted him as England's first choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Paul Merson]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] approached Seaman, and later ex-[[Wales national football team|Wales]] goalkeeper [[Neville Southall]] and [[Chris Woods]], to play in an [[FA Cup]] game at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] as their two first-choice keepers, [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Andy Oakes (footballer)|Andy Oakes]], were unavailable.

England went out on penalties, losing against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. [[Kevin Keegan]] selected him for [[UEFA Euro 2000]], where he started against both [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] but sustained an injury in his warm-up exercises for the third game against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and was replaced by [[Nigel Martyn]].

He also became the [[spokesman]] for [[Yorkshire Tea]] during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced [[Gary Lineker]] as team captain on the television quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate [[Ian Wright]].\n\nIn December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in ''Strictly Ice Dancing'', an ice dance version of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing [[Paul Gascoigne]]. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.\n\nIn late 2005 he had his trademark [[ponytail]] cut off on live television for charity, which ended negotiatory talks with such companies as L'Oreal who wanted to sponsor his hair as they had with [[David Ginola]]. He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place. He has also appeared on ''All Star [[Family Fortunes]]''.\n\nSeaman also hosts a \"Safe Hands\" charity golf event annually, and has released two football-themed [[DVD]]s entitled ''David Seaman's Goalkeeping Nightmares'' in 2003 and ''Jeepers Keepers'' in 2004.

NLMK's share of domestic crude steel production is about 21%. It primarily produces flat steel products, semi-finished steel products and electrical steels. NLMK also produces specialty coated steels, plus high-ductility and micro-alloyed steels.\n\n==History==\n\nHistorically, the [[Lipetsk]] area in central Russia has had substantial [[iron ore]] deposits. In 1702, [[Peter the Great]] ordered the construction of an iron [[foundry]] there.\n\nIn 1931, Novolipetsk Iron and Steel began construction of a plant on the site of the iron ore mine.<ref>[http://www.steelonthenet.com/kb/history-nlmk.html History of NLMK since 1931]</ref> Prospering down through the decades, Novolipetsk became a [[joint-stock company]] in 1992 and then in 1993 began the process of [[privatization]] by distributing company shares to its employees. The company seems to be acquisitive; see list of related organizations. In 1998, [[Vladimir Lisin]] became the chairman. The manufacturing area in Lipetsk covers 27 square kilometers.\n\nLess than half of NLMK's output of steel is sold in Russia.\n\nThe company's primary source of iron ore is now [[Stoilensky GOK]], a company which is 350&nbsp;km from the mills at Lipetsk.\n\n==Business==\nCurrently Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) located in Lipetsk is one of the world's most profitable steel companies per tonne of production and by far the most profitable steel-making company in Russia, with an [[EBITDA]] margin of $2,28 bln (-3%). Company's revenue (US GAAP) in 2013 is $10,909 bln, net profit \u2014 $189 mln.\n\nNLMK's assets are technically advanced and on par with its global peers. NLMK is fully self-sufficient in iron-ore through its 97% stake in Stoilensky GOK, Russia's 3rd-largest iron ore producer.\n\nOn December 15, 2005, the company listed 42 million (8.3% of the total number of shares) of its Global Depositary Shares (GDSs) on the [[London Stock Exchange]] ({{lse|NLMK}}). Each GDS represents 10 ordinary shares.\n\nIn June 2006 NLMK altered its [[dividend policy]] and increased its target payout ratio from 15% to 20% of its net income under [[US GAAP]]. The company pursues the goal of bringing its total dividends over a five-year period to 30%.\n\n===Acquisitions===\nNLMK's global M&A activity has been focused on assets which the company could effectively leverage for processing its low-cost slabs into high-value-added products in its key export markets. The largest of NLMK's acquisitions was a 50% stake in a joint venture with the [[:de:Duferco]] Group in December 2006. The venture includes one steel plant and five rolling mills in Western Europe and the United States. The joint venture also includes service and distribution facilities located in Europe.\n\n* [[OJSC Dolomite]], miner and processor of metallurgical [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], acquired in 1997\n* [[OJSC Stagdok]], miner and processor of fluxing [[limestone]], acquired in 1999\n* [[OJSC Stoilensky GOK]], iron ore supplier, acquired in 2004 (97%)\n* [[OJSC TMTP]], operator of the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Tuapse]], acquired in 2004 (controlling interest)\n* License for the large coking [[coal]] deposit [[Zhernovskoie 1]] in the [[Kuznetsk Basin|Kuzbass]] region of Russia, acquired at State auction in 2005\n* [[DanSteel A/S]], Danish steel rolling company, acquired in 2006\n* [[OJSC Altai-koks]], acquired in 2006\n* [[VIZ-Stal]], the second-largest Russian [[electrical steel]] producer, acquired in 2006\n* [[Sharon Coatings]]\n\n==Ecology==\nSince 2007 NLMK has implemented a number of investment projects on [[environmental protection]].

This was ultimately Group C. No group could contain more than two European teams, no unseeded South American team could be drawn with Brazil or Argentina and no unseeded Asian team could be drawn with South Korea or Japan.\n\nFrance, as holders were automatically placed in Group A, South Korea were placed in Group D and Japan were placed in Group H. One of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea and the other had to play in a group played in Japan. In Pot C, China had to play in South Korea (either group A, B or C) which meant that the other Asian team in Pot C (Saudi Arabia) had to play in Japan (either group E, F or G). In Pot D, two or three African teams and one or two CONCACAF teams had to play in either South Korea or Japan.\n\nOn 1 December 2001, the draw was held and the group assignments and order of fixtures were determined.

Brazil's captain [[Cafu]], who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.\n\n----\n{{footballbox\n|date = 30 June 2002\n|time = 20:00\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|GER}}\n|score = [[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Final|0\u20132]]\n|report = [https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=43950600/match=43950064/ Report]\n|team2 = {{fb|BRA}}\n|goals1 =\n|goals2 = [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] {{goal|67||79}}\n|stadium = [[International Stadium Yokohama]], [[Yokohama]]\n|attendance = 69,029\n|referee = [[Pierluigi Collina]] ([[Italian Football Federation|Italy]]) \n|nobars=!\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2002 FIFA World Cup statistics}}\n\n===Goalscorers===\n[[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Golden Shoe]] after scoring eight goals.

No group could contain more than two European teams, no unseeded South American team could be drawn with Brazil or Argentina and no unseeded Asian team could be drawn with South Korea or Japan.\n\nFrance, as holders were automatically placed in Group A, South Korea were placed in Group D and Japan were placed in Group H. One of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea and the other had to play in a group played in Japan. In Pot C, China had to play in South Korea (either group A, B or C) which meant that the other Asian team in Pot C (Saudi Arabia) had to play in Japan (either group E, F or G). In Pot D, two or three African teams and one or two CONCACAF teams had to play in either South Korea or Japan.\n\nOn 1 December 2001, the draw was held and the group assignments and order of fixtures were determined. Group F was considered the [[group of death]], as it brought together Argentina, England, Nigeria and Sweden.\n\n== Group stage ==\n''All times are [[Korea Standard Time]] and [[Japan Standard Time]] ([[UTC+09:00|UTC+9]])''\n[[File:2002 world cup.png|right|thumb|upright=1.9|{{col-start}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#2b42a3|Champion}} {{legend|#34c0be|Runner-up}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#269c5a|Third place}} {{legend|#81c846|Fourth place}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#e4e454|Quarter-finals}} {{legend|#f4d4ac|Round of 16}} {{col-4}} {{legend|#b94954|Group stage}} {{col-end}}]] <!-- Note: background colour style shown here for later use, when colour codes used in map determined: <span style=\"background-color:yellow\">text here</span>--->\n\nGroups A, B, C, D based in [[South Korea]].
