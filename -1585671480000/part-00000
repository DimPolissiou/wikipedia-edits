The act was passed in 1830, although dialogue had been ongoing since 1802 between Georgia and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] concerning such an event. Ethan Davis states that \"the federal government had promised Georgia that it would extinguish Indian title within the state's borders by purchase 'as soon as such purchase could be made upon reasonable terms'\".<ref>{{cite journal | title=An Administrative Trail of Tears: Indian Removal | authorlink= | last= Davis | first= Ethan | journal= The American Journal of Legal History|volume=50|issue=1 | pages= 50\u201355}}</ref> As time passed, southern states began to speed up the process by posing the argument that the deal between Georgia and the federal government had no contract and that southern states could pass the law themselves. This scheme forced the national government to pass the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830, in which President Jackson agreed to divide the United States territory west of the Mississippi into districts for tribes to replace the land from which they were removed.\n\nIn the 1823 case of ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] handed down a decision stating that Indians could occupy and control lands within the United States but could not hold title to those lands.<ref name=\"pbsremoval\">{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html| title=Indial Removal 1814\u20131858| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref> Jackson viewed the union as a [[Federalism|federation of highly esteemed states]], as was common before the [[American Civil War]]. He opposed Washington's policy of establishing treaties with Indian tribes as if they were foreign nations. Thus, the creation of Indian jurisdictions was a violation of state sovereignty under [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#New states|Article IV, Section 3]] of the Constitution. As Jackson saw it, either Indians comprised sovereign states (which violated the Constitution) or they were subject to the laws of existing states of the Union. Jackson urged Indians to assimilate and obey state laws. Further, he believed that he could only accommodate the desire for Indian self-rule in federal territories, which required resettlement west of the Mississippi River on federal lands.<ref>{{cite book | title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times| authorlink=H.W.

Many Americans during this time favored its passage, but there was also significant opposition. Many Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] protested against it, most notably missionary organizer [[Jeremiah Evarts]]. In Congress, [[New Jersey]] Senator [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and [[Tennessee]] Congressman [[Davy Crockett]] spoke out against the legislation. The Removal Act passed only after bitter debate in Congress.<ref>Howe pp. 348\u201352.</ref>\n\nJackson viewed the demise of Indian tribal nations as inevitable, pointing to the advancement of settled life and demise of tribal nations in the American northeast. He called his northern critics hypocrites, given the [[Northern United States|North]]'s history. Indian tribes had become nearly extinct, Indian hunting grounds had been replaced with family farms, and state law had replaced tribal law. If the Indians of the south were to survive and their culture be maintained, they faced powerful historical forces that could only be postponed. He dismissed romantic portrayals of lost Indian culture as a sentimental longing for a simpler time in the past, stating that \"progress requires moving forward.\"<ref name=b489>Brands; (2006); pp. 489\u201393</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country and philanthropy has long been busily employed in devising means to avert it, but its progress has never for a moment been arrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth...But true philanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to the extinction of one generation to make room for another...In the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or has disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes...Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers.

W. Brands]], Jackson sincerely believed that his [[population transfer]] was a \"wise and humane policy\" that would save the Indians from \"utter annihilation\". Brands writes that, given the \"racist realities of the time, Jackson was almost certainly correct in contending that for the Cherokees to remain in Georgia risked their extinction\".

The act was passed in 1830, although dialogue had been ongoing since 1802 between Georgia and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] concerning such an event. Ethan Davis states that \"the federal government had promised Georgia that it would extinguish Indian title within the state's borders by purchase 'as soon as such purchase could be made upon reasonable terms'\".<ref>{{cite journal | title=An Administrative Trail of Tears: Indian Removal | authorlink= | last= Davis | first= Ethan | journal= The American Journal of Legal History|volume=50|issue=1 | pages= 50\u201355}}</ref> As time passed, southern states began to speed up the process by posing the argument that the deal between Georgia and the federal government had no contract and that southern states could pass the law themselves. This scheme forced the national government to pass the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830, in which President Jackson agreed to divide the United States territory west of the Mississippi into districts for tribes to replace the land from which they were removed.\n\nIn the 1823 case of ''[[Johnson v.

He opposed Washington's policy of establishing treaties with Indian tribes as if they were foreign nations. Thus, the creation of Indian jurisdictions was a violation of state sovereignty under [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#New states|Article IV, Section 3]] of the Constitution. As Jackson saw it, either Indians comprised sovereign states (which violated the Constitution) or they were subject to the laws of existing states of the Union. Jackson urged Indians to assimilate and obey state laws. Further, he believed that he could only accommodate the desire for Indian self-rule in federal territories, which required resettlement west of the Mississippi River on federal lands.<ref>{{cite book | title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times| authorlink=H.W.

Many Americans during this time favored its passage, but there was also significant opposition. Many Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] protested against it, most notably missionary organizer [[Jeremiah Evarts]]. In Congress, [[New Jersey]] Senator [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and [[Tennessee]] Congressman [[Davy Crockett]] spoke out against the legislation. The Removal Act passed only after bitter debate in Congress.<ref>Howe pp. 348\u201352.</ref>\n\nJackson viewed the demise of Indian tribal nations as inevitable, pointing to the advancement of settled life and demise of tribal nations in the American northeast. He called his northern critics hypocrites, given the [[Northern United States|North]]'s history. Indian tribes had become nearly extinct, Indian hunting grounds had been replaced with family farms, and state law had replaced tribal law. If the Indians of the south were to survive and their culture be maintained, they faced powerful historical forces that could only be postponed. He dismissed romantic portrayals of lost Indian culture as a sentimental longing for a simpler time in the past, stating that \"progress requires moving forward.\"<ref name=b489>Brands; (2006); pp. 489\u201393</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country and philanthropy has long been busily employed in devising means to avert it, but its progress has never for a moment been arrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth...But true philanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to the extinction of one generation to make room for another...In the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or has disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes...Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers.

Trans World Airlines (TWA) was headquartered in New York City but its main base of employment was at [[Kansas City International Airport]] and had large operations at [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]] as well as St. Louis. TWA deemed Kansas City's terminals as unsuitable to serve as a primary hub. TWA reluctantly ruled out Chicago, as its Chicago operation was already losing $25 million a year under competition from American Airlines and [[United Airlines]]. This meant that St. Louis was the carrier's only viable option. TWA proceeded to downsize Chicago and build up St. Louis, swapping three Chicago gates for five of American's St. Louis gates. By December 1982, St. Louis accounted for 20% of TWA's domestic capacity. Lambert's terminal was initially too small for this operation, and TWA was forced to use temporary terminals, mobile lounges and airstairs to handle the additional flights.<ref>{{cite news|title=STL: How To Build A Hub|url=http://statehistoricalsocietyofmissouri.org/cdm/ref/collection/twa/id/8132|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=TWA Mainliner|date=11 October 1982|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017161105/http://statehistoricalsocietyofmissouri.org/cdm/ref/collection/twa/id/8132|archivedate=October 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After Concourse D was completed in 1985, TWA began transatlantic service from Lambert to London, Frankfurt and Paris.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://flystl.com/AboutLambert/History.aspx|publisher=Lambert-St. Louis International Airport|accessdate=11 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813131725/http://flystl.com/AboutLambert/History.aspx|archivedate=August 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTWA's hub grew again in 1986 when the airline bought Ozark Airlines, which operated its hub from Lambert's B, C, and D concourses.

Of those 515 flights, 352 were on TWA mainline aircraft and 163 were Trans World Express flights operated by its commuter airline partners. During this period, Lambert Field was ranked as the eighth-busiest U.S. airport by flights (not by total passengers), largely due to TWA's hub operations, Southwest Airlines' growing traffic, and commuter traffic to smaller cities in the region. Congestion caused delays during peak hours and was exacerbated when bad weather reduced the number of usable runways from three to one. To cope, Lambert officials briefly redesignated the taxiway immediately north of runway 12L\u201330R as runway 13\u201331 and used it for commuter and general aviation traffic.

Moody's raised its rating on Lambert Airport's bonds to A3 with a stable outlook from Baa1 with a stable outlook. Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised its rating to A- with a stable outlook from A- with a negative outlook. This was the first time in more than a decade that both Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings for the Airport had both been in the single \"A\" category. Earlier in the month, Fitch Ratings upgraded outstanding airport revenue bonds to 'BBB+' from 'BBB' with a stable outlook. The rating agencies attributed the upgrades to strong fiscal management and positive passenger traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flystl.com/Newsroom/Blog/tabid/422/entryid/133/Bond-Ratings-and-Passenger-Traffic-on-Upswing-at-Lambert.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319092206/http://www.flystl.com/Newsroom/Blog/tabid/422/entryid/133/Bond-Ratings-and-Passenger-Traffic-on-Upswing-at-Lambert.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-03-19|title=Lambert-St. Louis Int'l. website, Retrieved July 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the airport released a new Five Year Strategic Plan. The overall mission statement of the airport was given as \"connecting [the St. Louis] region with the world\", while also detailed were four major strategic objectives: Strengthening Financial Sustainability; Sustaining and Growing Passenger Air Service; Creating a Positive and Lasting Impression for the Region; and Generating Economic Development. The plan went into detail regarding each objective, listing overall measures of success and potential methods to attain successful outcomes. Some of the given measures of success are reducing costs per enplaned passenger, reducing the airport's debt service, maximizing sources of revenue (primarily non-aviation), increasing passenger throughput, gaining new passenger services, improving satisfaction survey scores, and increasing revenue from cargo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flystl.com/uploads/documents/public-notices-and-reports/STL-2015-2020-Strategic-Plan.pdf |title=lam6535 Brochure_insert.ai |date= |accessdate=2018-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610200746/http://www.flystl.com/uploads/documents/public-notices-and-reports/STL-2015-2020-Strategic-Plan.pdf |archive-date=June 10, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, the airport completed renovations of Terminal 1, concluding more than seven years of planning and renovation work throughout the airport.<ref name=\"AEP\" />\n\nIn late 2016, the [[City of St. Louis]] announced it would either keep the name '''Lambert\u2013St. Louis International Airport''' or change it to '''St. Louis International Airport at Lambert Field'''.

Preliminary work, including upgrades to the existing terminal fuel lines, was completed by August 2019, with site preparation and foundation work on the storage facility proper beginning that same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2018/stl-airlines-to-invest-50-million-for-jet-fuel-storage-facility|title=STL Airlines to Invest $50 million for Jet Fuel Storage Facility \u2013 St. Louis Lambert International Airport|first=St Louis|last=Lambert|date=March 2, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=November 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010095824/https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2018/stl-airlines-to-invest-50-million-for-jet-fuel-storage-facility|archive-date=October 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2019/construction-begins-on-new-jet-fuel-storage-facility-at-stl|title=Construction Begins on New Jet Fuel Storage Facility at STL|first=|last=|date=August 28, 2019|publisher=|accessdate=August 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828213653/https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2019/construction-begins-on-new-jet-fuel-storage-facility-at-stl|archive-date=August 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, the airport announced the commencement of service by a new airline, [[Sun Country Airlines]], with seasonal flights to [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]] and [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]] beginning later in 2018.<ref name=\"fox2now.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fox2now.com/2018/06/26/st-louis-lambert-airport-to-announce-new-airline-service/|title=New airline offering direct flights from St. Louis to Tampa and Ft.

The idea was positively received by St. Louis and airport officials and won local approval, culminating in a three-year agreement to prepare studies and applications for the facility in late 2014.

Trans World Airlines (TWA) was headquartered in New York City but its main base of employment was at [[Kansas City International Airport]] and had large operations at [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]] as well as St. Louis. TWA deemed Kansas City's terminals as unsuitable to serve as a primary hub. TWA reluctantly ruled out Chicago, as its Chicago operation was already losing $25 million a year under competition from American Airlines and [[United Airlines]]. This meant that St. Louis was the carrier's only viable option. TWA proceeded to downsize Chicago and build up St. Louis, swapping three Chicago gates for five of American's St. Louis gates. By December 1982, St. Louis accounted for 20% of TWA's domestic capacity. Lambert's terminal was initially too small for this operation, and TWA was forced to use temporary terminals, mobile lounges and airstairs to handle the additional flights.<ref>{{cite news|title=STL: How To Build A Hub|url=http://statehistoricalsocietyofmissouri.org/cdm/ref/collection/twa/id/8132|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=TWA Mainliner|date=11 October 1982|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017161105/http://statehistoricalsocietyofmissouri.org/cdm/ref/collection/twa/id/8132|archivedate=October 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After Concourse D was completed in 1985, TWA began transatlantic service from Lambert to London, Frankfurt and Paris.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://flystl.com/AboutLambert/History.aspx|publisher=Lambert-St. Louis International Airport|accessdate=11 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813131725/http://flystl.com/AboutLambert/History.aspx|archivedate=August 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTWA's hub grew again in 1986 when the airline bought Ozark Airlines, which operated its hub from Lambert's B, C, and D concourses.

Of those 515 flights, 352 were on TWA mainline aircraft and 163 were Trans World Express flights operated by its commuter airline partners. During this period, Lambert Field was ranked as the eighth-busiest U.S. airport by flights (not by total passengers), largely due to TWA's hub operations, Southwest Airlines' growing traffic, and commuter traffic to smaller cities in the region. Congestion caused delays during peak hours and was exacerbated when bad weather reduced the number of usable runways from three to one.

Moody's raised its rating on Lambert Airport's bonds to A3 with a stable outlook from Baa1 with a stable outlook. Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised its rating to A- with a stable outlook from A- with a negative outlook. This was the first time in more than a decade that both Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings for the Airport had both been in the single \"A\" category. Earlier in the month, Fitch Ratings upgraded outstanding airport revenue bonds to 'BBB+' from 'BBB' with a stable outlook. The rating agencies attributed the upgrades to strong fiscal management and positive passenger traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flystl.com/Newsroom/Blog/tabid/422/entryid/133/Bond-Ratings-and-Passenger-Traffic-on-Upswing-at-Lambert.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319092206/http://www.flystl.com/Newsroom/Blog/tabid/422/entryid/133/Bond-Ratings-and-Passenger-Traffic-on-Upswing-at-Lambert.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-03-19|title=Lambert-St. Louis Int'l. website, Retrieved July 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the airport released a new Five Year Strategic Plan. The overall mission statement of the airport was given as \"connecting [the St. Louis] region with the world\", while also detailed were four major strategic objectives: Strengthening Financial Sustainability; Sustaining and Growing Passenger Air Service; Creating a Positive and Lasting Impression for the Region; and Generating Economic Development. The plan went into detail regarding each objective, listing overall measures of success and potential methods to attain successful outcomes. Some of the given measures of success are reducing costs per enplaned passenger, reducing the airport's debt service, maximizing sources of revenue (primarily non-aviation), increasing passenger throughput, gaining new passenger services, improving satisfaction survey scores, and increasing revenue from cargo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flystl.com/uploads/documents/public-notices-and-reports/STL-2015-2020-Strategic-Plan.pdf |title=lam6535 Brochure_insert.ai |date= |accessdate=2018-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610200746/http://www.flystl.com/uploads/documents/public-notices-and-reports/STL-2015-2020-Strategic-Plan.pdf |archive-date=June 10, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, the airport completed renovations of Terminal 1, concluding more than seven years of planning and renovation work throughout the airport.<ref name=\"AEP\" />\n\nIn late 2016, the [[City of St. Louis]] announced it would either keep the name '''Lambert\u2013St. Louis International Airport''' or change it to '''St. Louis International Airport at Lambert Field'''.

Preliminary work, including upgrades to the existing terminal fuel lines, was completed by August 2019, with site preparation and foundation work on the storage facility proper beginning that same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2018/stl-airlines-to-invest-50-million-for-jet-fuel-storage-facility|title=STL Airlines to Invest $50 million for Jet Fuel Storage Facility \u2013 St. Louis Lambert International Airport|first=St Louis|last=Lambert|date=March 2, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=November 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010095824/https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2018/stl-airlines-to-invest-50-million-for-jet-fuel-storage-facility|archive-date=October 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2019/construction-begins-on-new-jet-fuel-storage-facility-at-stl|title=Construction Begins on New Jet Fuel Storage Facility at STL|first=|last=|date=August 28, 2019|publisher=|accessdate=August 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828213653/https://www.flystl.com/newsroom/stl-news/2019/construction-begins-on-new-jet-fuel-storage-facility-at-stl|archive-date=August 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, the airport announced the commencement of service by a new airline, [[Sun Country Airlines]], with seasonal flights to [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]] and [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]] beginning later in 2018.<ref name=\"fox2now.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fox2now.com/2018/06/26/st-louis-lambert-airport-to-announce-new-airline-service/|title=New airline offering direct flights from St. Louis to Tampa and Ft.

The idea was positively received by St. Louis and airport officials and won local approval, culminating in a three-year agreement to prepare studies and applications for the facility in late 2014.

The probable cause was determined to be a combination of inadequate VFR procedures in place at the airport, the failure of the DC-9 crew to notice the other aircraft in time, the controller's failure to ensure that the Cessna had received and understood important landing information, and the Cessna crew's deviation from their traffic pattern instructions and/or their continuation to a critical point in the traffic pattern without informing the controller of the progress of the flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1968-03-27-US.pdf |title=Accident report |date=1968 |website= |access-date=July 31, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215234027/http://fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1968-03-27-US.pdf |archive-date=December 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* July 23, 1973: while on the approach to land at St. Louis International Airport, [[Ozark Air Lines Flight 809]] crashed near the University of Missouri \u2013 St. Louis, killing 38 of the 44 persons on board.
