{"title_page": "International Association of National Public Health Institutes", "text_new": "The '''International Association of National Public Health Institutes''' ('''IANPHI''') is a member organization of government agencies working to improve national disease prevention and response. IANPHI is made up of 100+ members, located in approximately 90 countries.<ref>IANPHI, OUR MEMBERS, http://ianphi.org/membercountries/index.html</ref> An important goal of IANPHI is to improve health outcomes by strengthening or creating NPHIs.\n\nThe IANPHI Secretariat is based at the [[Institut de veille sanitaire|Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS)]] of [[France]], and the US Office is located at the [[Emory University]] Global Health Institute in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, GA]]. The IANPHI Foundation is located in [[Finland]] at [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|THL]]. Coordinated by Secretary General Jean Claude Desenclos, the IANPHI team is responsible for member relations and programs, policy, communications and NPHI development projects (USA), and the annual meeting scientific program (France).\n\nAt its inception, IANPHI received seed funds from the Rockefeller Foundation and a one-year planning grant from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)]]. BMGF subsequently awarded multi-year funds for IANPHI's development and to support projects to build NPHIs in low- and middle-income countries. Resources have since been contributed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. CDC]]<ref>IANPHI, HISTORY. http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/history.html</ref> A recent role for IANPHI has been to work with the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance project.<ref>IANPHI, \"Champions for Addressing Childhood Mortality.\" http://www.ianphi.org/news/2016/gpb.html</ref>\n\n==The National Public Health Institute model==\nThe [[National public health institutes]] (NPHI) model, exemplified by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[Centers for Disease Control (Republic of China)|China CDC]], [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] and others, is an effective and cost-efficient way to systematically develop and sustain national public health systems. NPHIs, including China CDC, INSP in Mexico, [[Fiocruz|FIOCRUZ]] in [[Brazil]] and others in over 90 countries around the world, have been major contributors to reductions in morbidity and mortality from [[Infection|infectious]] and [[Non-communicable disease|noncommunicable]] conditions. Many, including the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland), have developed over several decades, while others, including NPHIs in [[Liberia]] and [[Canada]], were created following poorly managed threats such as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and [[SARS coronavirus|SARS]], in recognition that a coordinated system with a specialized institution is needed to effectively respond to disease threats.\n\nNPHIs usually lead national efforts for disease surveillance and outbreak investigation (to monitor population health trends and detect and resolve outbreaks), laboratory services (to identify and confirm disease threats), health programs (including recommendations for immunizations and maternal and child health initiatives), and public health workforce development and research (including new treatments and technologies). NPHIs are designed to give governments the ability to assess and address major acute and long-term disease threats in a country using scientific, evidence-based policies and strategies, as well as create a career home for public health researchers and scientists, thereby fostering the evidence-based approaches necessary to ensure that government policies are based on scientific evidence rather than politics.\n\n==History and activities==\nIn 2002, the directors of nearly 30 NPHIs met in [[Bellagio, Italy]] to share best practices and discuss opportunities for collaboration. In 2004, the group reconvened in Helsinki and declared its intention to forge an alliance.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|title=History|work=ianphi.org|access-date=2013-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428072858/http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|archive-date=2013-04-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIANPHI was formally launched at the first General Assembly in Brazil in January 2006, with 39 founding members and a one-year grant from the Gates Foundation. Under a subsequent five-year grant from the Gates Foundation awarded in late 2006, the membership has expanded to 100 institutes in 88 countries around the world.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\"/>\n\nIANPHI's activities fall into three areas:<ref>[http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017003447/http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/ |date=October 17, 2013 }}</ref> \n* Projects (targeting investments to create or strengthen NPHIs in low-resource countries)\n* Policy (developing a framework, tools and policy papers for public [[health system strengthening]])\n* Leadership development (creating an international community of NPHI directors)\n\n==Peer-to-Peer Partnerships==\nOne of IANPHI's distinctive features and strengths is a peer-assistance approach that facilitates sharing of expertise and experience among member NPHIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=IANPHI Peer-to-Peer Model|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/peertopeer.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref>  The model clearly benefits the recipient NPHI by identifying strategies to address priority needs and raising standards of performance for organizing and conducting public health functions. But it rewards the contributing institute as well \u2013 by sharing skills and assets to benefit others while also linking resources and solutions to address regional and global health threats and opportunities.\n\nFor the network of IANPHI members, the model provides unique opportunities for NPHIs to link with others that are geographically or linguistically similar or are struggling with similar technical or programmatic issues, such as information system development or pandemic preparedness.  This collaborative approach also provides a platform for developing research or programs to address shared issues, whether laboratory safety or avian influenza, tobacco use or injury.\n\nCurrent peer-to-peer partnerships include:\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/inlasapartnership.html Peru and Bolivia - INLASA Partnership]\n*Norway and Malawi - [http://ianphi.org/news/2014/malawinorway.html Host Workshop] and [http://ianphi.org/news/2013/norway.html Peer-to-Peer organizational development]\n*[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/projects/kenya.html UK and Kenya - Science-to-Policy Expertise]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/phacvisit.html Canada and Kenya - Study Tour]\n*Morocco and Togo - Strengthening Information Systems\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/uvriphe.html UK and Uganda - Communications and Advocacy]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/peertopeermodel.html France and Togo - Epidemic Intelligence and Disease Surveillance]\n*France and Togo/C\u00f4te d'Ivoire - Influencing Policy through Publication\n\n==Heymann Mentorship Program==\n[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/heymannmentorshipprogram.html The IANPHI Heymann Mentorship Program] aims to encourage public health leadership growth by facilitating one-on-one relationships between established public health leaders and less-experienced counterparts in low-resource countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heymann Mentorship Program|url=http://www.ianphi.org/resources/toolkit/mentorship.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> It is part of an ongoing IANPHI effort to build human capacity and provide a career path for public health professionals through training in strategic leadership and management. Part of this commitment involves providing current and future NPHI leaders with the tools, training, and support they need to develop their full potential.\n\nThe Heymann Mentorship Program provides each mentee (\"fellow\") an opportunity to develop an ongoing relationship with a mentor with career experience as a public health expert and leader. The program focuses on current and future leaders of NPHIs in IANPHI project sites and strategically targets persons interested in guidance, coaching, counseling, and professional development.\n\n==List of IANPHI members==\n\n===Full Members===\n{{External links|section|date=March 2016}}\n# Afghanistan: [http://moph.gov.af/en Afghan Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|title=Afghan National Public Health Institute|url=http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|publisher=Moph.gov.af|accessdate=2015-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406065246/http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|archive-date=2015-04-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n# Albania: [http://ishp.gov.al/ Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ishp.gov.al/|title=Instituti i Sh\u00ebndetit Publik -

NIHE hopes to get a better understanding of the biological mechanism for gastric cancer in order to provide better diagnosis and treatment options for people in Vietnam, where gastric cancer is the second most common cancer found in men and the third most common in women.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.ianphi.org/}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Association of National Public Health Institutes, The}}\n[[Category:Public health organizations]]\n[[Category:International medical and health organizations]]\n[[Category:International organizations based in France]]\n", "text_old": "The '''International Association of National Public Health Institutes''' ('''IANPHI''') is a member organization of government agencies working to improve national disease prevention and response. IANPHI is made up of 100+ members, located in approximately 90 countries.<ref>IANPHI, OUR MEMBERS, http://ianphi.org/membercountries/index.html</ref> An important goal of IANPHI is to improve health outcomes by strengthening or creating NPHIs.\n\nThe IANPHI Secretariat is based at the [[Institut de veille sanitaire|Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS)]] of [[France]], and the US Office is located at the [[Emory University]] Global Health Institute in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, GA]]. The IANPHI Foundation is located in [[Finland]] at [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|THL]]. Coordinated by Secretary General Jean Claude Desenclos, the IANPHI team is responsible for member relations and programs, policy, communications and NPHI development projects (USA), and the annual meeting scientific program (France).\n\nAt its inception, IANPHI received seed funds from the Rockefeller Foundation and a one-year planning grant from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)]]. BMGF subsequently awarded multi-year funds for IANPHI's development and to support projects to build NPHIs in low- and middle-income countries. Resources have since been contributed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. CDC]]<ref>IANPHI, HISTORY. http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/history.html</ref> A recent role for IANPHI has been to work with the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance project.<ref>IANPHI, \"Champions for Addressing Childhood Mortality.\" http://www.ianphi.org/news/2016/gpb.html</ref>\n\n==The National Public Health Institute model==\nThe [[National public health institutes]] (NPHI) model, exemplified by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[Centers for Disease Control (Republic of China)|China CDC]], [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] and others, is an effective and cost-efficient way to systematically develop and sustain national public health systems. NPHIs, including China CDC, INSP in Mexico, [[Fiocruz|FIOCRUZ]] in [[Brazil]] and others in over 90 countries around the world, have been major contributors to reductions in morbidity and mortality from [[Infection|infectious]] and [[Non-communicable disease|noncommunicable]] conditions. Many, including the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland), have developed over several decades, while others, including NPHIs in [[Liberia]] and [[Canada]], were created following poorly managed threats such as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and [[SARS coronavirus|SARS]], in recognition that a coordinated system with a specialized institution is needed to effectively respond to disease threats.\n\nNPHIs usually lead national efforts for disease surveillance and outbreak investigation (to monitor population health trends and detect and resolve outbreaks), laboratory services (to identify and confirm disease threats), health programs (including recommendations for immunizations and maternal and child health initiatives), and public health workforce development and research (including new treatments and technologies). NPHIs are designed to give governments the ability to assess and address major acute and long-term disease threats in a country using scientific, evidence-based policies and strategies, as well as create a career home for public health researchers and scientists, thereby fostering the evidence-based approaches necessary to ensure that government policies are based on scientific evidence rather than politics.\n\n==History and activities==\nIn 2002, the directors of nearly 30 NPHIs met in [[Bellagio, Italy]] to share best practices and discuss opportunities for collaboration. In 2004, the group reconvened in Helsinki and declared its intention to forge an alliance.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|title=History|work=ianphi.org|access-date=2013-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428072858/http://www.ianphi.org/whoweare/history.html|archive-date=2013-04-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIANPHI was formally launched at the first General Assembly in Brazil in January 2006, with 39 founding members and a one-year grant from the Gates Foundation. Under a subsequent five-year grant from the Gates Foundation awarded in late 2006, the membership has expanded to 100 institutes in 88 countries around the world.<ref name=\"ianphi.org\"/>\n\nIANPHI's activities fall into three areas:<ref>[http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017003447/http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/index.html/ |date=October 17, 2013 }}</ref> \n* Projects (targeting investments to create or strengthen NPHIs in low-resource countries)\n* Policy (developing a framework, tools and policy papers for public [[health system strengthening]])\n* Leadership development (creating an international community of NPHI directors)\n\n==Peer-to-Peer Partnerships==\nOne of IANPHI's distinctive features and strengths is a peer-assistance approach that facilitates sharing of expertise and experience among member NPHIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=IANPHI Peer-to-Peer Model|url=http://www.ianphi.org/whatwedo/peertopeer.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref>  The model clearly benefits the recipient NPHI by identifying strategies to address priority needs and raising standards of performance for organizing and conducting public health functions. But it rewards the contributing institute as well \u2013 by sharing skills and assets to benefit others while also linking resources and solutions to address regional and global health threats and opportunities.\n\nFor the network of IANPHI members, the model provides unique opportunities for NPHIs to link with others that are geographically or linguistically similar or are struggling with similar technical or programmatic issues, such as information system development or pandemic preparedness.  This collaborative approach also provides a platform for developing research or programs to address shared issues, whether laboratory safety or avian influenza, tobacco use or injury.\n\nCurrent peer-to-peer partnerships include:\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/inlasapartnership.html Peru and Bolivia - INLASA Partnership]\n*Norway and Malawi - [http://ianphi.org/news/2014/malawinorway.html Host Workshop] and [http://ianphi.org/news/2013/norway.html Peer-to-Peer organizational development]\n*[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/projects/kenya.html UK and Kenya - Science-to-Policy Expertise]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2014/phacvisit.html Canada and Kenya - Study Tour]\n*Morocco and Togo - Strengthening Information Systems\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/uvriphe.html UK and Uganda - Communications and Advocacy]\n*[http://ianphi.org/news/2013/peertopeermodel.html France and Togo - Epidemic Intelligence and Disease Surveillance]\n*France and Togo/C\u00f4te d'Ivoire - Influencing Policy through Publication\n\n==Heymann Mentorship Program==\n[http://ianphi.org/whatwedo/heymannmentorshipprogram.html The IANPHI Heymann Mentorship Program] aims to encourage public health leadership growth by facilitating one-on-one relationships between established public health leaders and less-experienced counterparts in low-resource countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heymann Mentorship Program|url=http://www.ianphi.org/resources/toolkit/mentorship.html|publisher=Ianphi.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> It is part of an ongoing IANPHI effort to build human capacity and provide a career path for public health professionals through training in strategic leadership and management. Part of this commitment involves providing current and future NPHI leaders with the tools, training, and support they need to develop their full potential.\n\nThe Heymann Mentorship Program provides each mentee (\"fellow\") an opportunity to develop an ongoing relationship with a mentor with career experience as a public health expert and leader. The program focuses on current and future leaders of NPHIs in IANPHI project sites and strategically targets persons interested in guidance, coaching, counseling, and professional development.\n\n==List of IANPHI members==\n\n===Full Members===\n{{External links|section|date=March 2016}}\n# Afghanistan: [http://moph.gov.af/en Afghan Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|title=Afghan National Public Health Institute|url=http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|publisher=Moph.gov.af|accessdate=2015-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406065246/http://moph.gov.af/en/page/608|archive-date=2015-04-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n# Albania: [http://ishp.gov.al/ Public Health Institute]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ishp.gov.al/|title=Instituti i Sh\u00ebndetit Publik -

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life.

It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life.

It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov.

He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=501|3a1=King|3y=2002|3p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\",{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} while William F. Lewis commented that the movement's diversity \"has produced a complexity which is overwhelming to the observer\".{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=14}}\n\nThe term \"Rastafari\" derives from the pre-regnal title of [[Haile Selassie]], \"Ras Tafari Makonnen\"; the term \"Ras\" means a duke or prince, while \"Tafari Makonen\" was his name.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Ifekwe|2y=2008|2p=111|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=32|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=217}} It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} As well as being the religion's name, it is also used for the religion's practitioners themselves.{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=218}} Many commentators\u2014including some academic sources{{sfnm|1a1=Forsythe|1y=1980|1p=64|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=2, 103|4a1=King|4y=1998|4p=51|5a1=Middleton|5y=2006|5p=152|6a1=Glazier|6y=2012|6p=614|7a1=Chawane|7y=2014|7p=218}}\u2014refer to the movement as \"Rastafarianism\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=8}} This term has also been used by some practitioners.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=187}} However, the term \"Rastafarianism\" is considered embarrassing by many Rastas, who believe it has connotations of doctrine and organisation which they wish to avoid.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=8|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=218}} Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as \"insensitive\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n\n[[File:Liberty Bell Temple 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The Liberty Bell Temple in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|US]] was established by the American Rasta [[Ed Forchion]]]]\nRastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as \"Rastalogy\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} Edmonds described Rastafari as having \"a fairly cohesive worldview\";{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were \"fluid and open to interpretation\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=v}} Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a [[catechism]] or [[creed]] within the movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}}\n\nRastas place great emphasis on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=49\u201350, 63}} No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and which are [[heterodox]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}} The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma \"is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma\", according to Clarke.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}}\n\nRastafari is deeply influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Warner-Lewis|1y=1993|1p=108|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=183}} and shares many commonalities with Christianity.{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=231}} Michael Barnett noted that its theology is \"essentially Judeo-Christian\", representing \"an Afrocentralized blend of Christianity and Judaism\".{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=882}} Some Rastas openly describe themselves as Christians.{{sfn|Bedasse|2013|p=302}} It accords the [[Bible]] a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=14|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=74|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=184|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=232}} and adopts a [[Biblical literalism|literalist interpretation]] of its contents.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} According to the anthropologist [[Stephen D. Glazier]], Rasta approaches to the Bible result in the religion adopting an outlook that is very similar to forms of [[Protestantism]].{{sfn|Glazier|2012|p=614}} Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black African history and their place as God's favoured people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} They regard the Bible as the key to understanding both the past and the present and for predicting the future,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} while also regarding it as a source book from which they can form and legitimate their religious beliefs and practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=127|2a1=Mhango|2y=2008|2p=222}} Rastas commonly regard the final book of the Bible, the [[Book of Revelation]], as the most important part, because they see its contents as having particular significance for the world's present situation.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=73}}\n\nContrary to scholarly understandings of how the Bible was compiled, Rastas commonly believe it was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of [[Amharic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=127}} They also believe that the Bible's true meaning has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those seeking to deny black Africans their history.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=74|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=64|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=502}} They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=74}} They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation with the \"book within\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} As a result of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on black African history.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}} Common texts used for this purpose include [[Leonard Howell]]'s 1935 work ''[[The Promised Key]]'', [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]]' 1924 book ''[[Holy Piby]]'', and [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] 1920s work, the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]''.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}}\n\n===Jah and Jesus of Nazareth===\n\n[[File:Rasta Mural, Sheshemane (11417146756).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta mural in Sheshame, Ethiopia depicting Haile Selassie and the Lion of Judah]]\n\nRastafari are [[monotheism|monotheists]], worshiping a singular God whom they call [[Jah]].

In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia with the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In the [[New Testament]], \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}\n\nRastas regard Babylon as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} They perceive the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development,{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} and are often hostile to Western resource extraction from the continent.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Rastas often

\"Babylon\", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas usually use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse;{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=77|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=41}} many Rastas use the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the

die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid

By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa.{{sfn|Hamid|2002|p=xxxii}} In the 19th century, enslaved [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of [[Kumina]].

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism;

it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom. Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41\u201342}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38\u201339}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem,{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} with many regarding him as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Semaj|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=221}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}\n\n===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930\u20131949===\n\nHaile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2\u20135; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132|3a1=Loadenthal|3y=2013|3p=10}} Over the following years, a number of street preachers\u2014most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]\u2014began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=2|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=81|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=9}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=2}} Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by many Rastas to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.]]\n\nHowell has been described as the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85\u201386|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary

prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George

exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile

employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international

Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=63|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2p=285}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=64|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2pp=285\u2013286}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems;

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E.

I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.\"{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=70}} His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is \"no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=71}} Critics of Rastafari have used this as evidence that Rasta theological beliefs are incorrect,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} however for some Rastas, Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God, based on their reading of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 14:11.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=108|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=511}}\n\n===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===\n\n[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]\nAccording to Clarke, Rastafari is \"concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica while creating a new identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Its emphasis is on purging any belief in the inferiority of black people, and the superiority of white people, from the minds of its followers.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=864}} Rastafari is therefore Afrocentric,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2006|1p=882|2a1=Wittmann|2y=2011|2p=152}} equating blackness with the African continent,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} and thus endorsing a form of Pan-Africanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=39|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2p=311}}\n\nPractitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]\u2014God's [[chosen people]] in the Old Testament\u2014and believe that black Africans broadly or Rastas more specifically are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=168|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=129|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=17|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=111|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=38}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} although many Rastas believe that modern Jews' claims to be the descendants of the ancient Israelites are false.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=240}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's chosen people, meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=81|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=885}} Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of any feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}\n\nThere is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing in [[Scientific racism|the existence of a distinct black African race]] that is superior to other racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=169|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=191|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=113|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=504}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an \"implicit potential\" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not \"intrinsic\" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European can ever be a legitimate Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Others believe that an \"African\" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African \"attitude\" or \"spirit\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}\n\n====Babylon and Zion====\n\nRastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in \"Babylon\", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eyre|1y=1985|1p=145|2a1=Pereira|2y=1998|2p=31|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38\u201340}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175\u2013176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term \"Babylon\" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia with the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In the [[New Testament]], \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}\n\nRastas regard Babylon as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} They perceive the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development,{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} and are often hostile to Western resource extraction from the continent.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Rastas often expect white-dominant society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens they see it as confirmation of the correctness of their faith.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|A map of Ethiopia, the \"Zion\" of the Rastas]]\n\nRastas view \"[[Zion]]\" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with \"Babylon\", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas usually use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse;{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=77|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=41}} many Rastas use the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=294}}

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}\n\n====Salvation and

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political

activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while

Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in

By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa.{{sfn|Hamid|2002|p=xxxii}} In the 19th century, enslaved [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of [[Kumina]].

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism;

The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98\u201399|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19\u201320}} One of the most prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}}\n\n===International spread and decline: 1970\u2013present===\n[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rasta vendor plies his wares in the U.S. city of [[Washington D.C.]] in 2013]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=1998|2p=41|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=91\u201392|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n===Mansions of Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=63|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2p=285}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=64|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2pp=285\u2013286}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel

Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta

mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}} Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}} and in South Africa;{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=220}} in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|p=234}} At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Benjamin Zephaniah University of Hull.jpg|thumb|right|The poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] is a prominent British Rasta]]\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Rastas were among the [[British African-Caribbean people|thousands of Caribbean migrants settling in the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture;
