Although his music did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, he gradually achieved wider recognition and is now considered among the most influential English singer-songwriters of the last 50 years. Drake signed to [[Island Records]] when he was 20 years old and released his debut album, ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'', in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums: ''[[Bryter Layter]]'' and ''[[Pink Moon]]''. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release.<ref>However, BBC article by Mark Moxon from 14 January 2002 states that \"The album only sold 15,000 copies, which was enough to please the record company, but nothing like the success Nick was hoping for\".[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A662924]</ref>\n\nDrake's reluctance to perform live or be interviewed contributed to his lack of commercial success. He suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[insomnia]], topics often reflected in his lyrics. After completing ''Pink Moon'' in 1972, he withdrew from live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, at the age of 26, Drake died from an [[overdose]] of [[amitriptyline]], a prescribed [[antidepressant]].\n\nThe 1979 release of the retrospective album ''[[Fruit Tree (Nick Drake album)|Fruit Tree]]'' triggered a reassessment of Drake's catalogue. By the mid-1980s, artists such as [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]], [[David Sylvian]] and [[Peter Buck]] were crediting Drake as an influence. In 1985, the [[The Dream Academy|Dream Academy]] reached the UK and US charts with \"[[Life in a Northern Town]]\", dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, Drake had come to represent the \"doomed romantic\" musician in the UK music press, and was being cited by artists including [[Kate Bush]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] and the [[The Black Crowes|Black Crowes]]. The first Drake biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary ''A Stranger Among Us''. In 2000, the title track from ''Pink Moon'' appeared in a [[Volkswagen]] advertisement, and within a month Drake had sold more records than he had in the previous 30 years.\n\n== 1948\u20131966: Early life ==\nDrake's father, Rodney Shuttleworth Drake (1908\u20131988), moved to [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], in the early 1930s to work as an engineer with the [[Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation]].<ref>Dann (2006), 75.</ref> In 1934, Rodney met Nick's mother, [[Molly Drake|Molly Lloyd]] (1916\u20131993), the daughter of a senior member of the [[Indian Civil Service]].

Five years later, he went to [[Marlborough College]], a [[Public school (UK)|public school]] in [[Wiltshire]] attended by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished sprinter over 100 and 200 yards, representing the school's Open Team in 1966. He played [[Rugby football|rugby]] for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms.<ref>Marlborough College archives.</ref> School friends recall Drake as having been confident, often aloof, and \"quietly authoritative\".<ref>Dann (2006), 95, 97.</ref> His father Rodney remembered: \"In one of his reports [the headmaster] said that none of us seemed to know him very well.

He formed a band, the Perfumed Gardeners, with four schoolmates in 1964 or 1965. With Drake on piano and occasional [[Alto saxophone|alto sax]] and vocals, the group performed [[Pye International Records|Pye International R&B]] covers and jazz standards, as well as [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] and [[Manfred Mann]] songs. [[Chris de Burgh]] asked to join the band, but was rejected as his taste was \"too poppy\".<ref>Humphries (1997), p. 36.</ref>\n\nDrake's attention to his studies deteriorated and, although he had accelerated a year in Eagle House, at Marlborough he neglected his studies in favour of music. In 1963 he attained seven [[General Certificate of Education|GCE O-Levels]], fewer than his teachers had been expecting, failing \"Physics with Chemistry\", a fallback for students who struggled with science.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 100.</ref> In 1965, Drake paid \u00a313 ({{Inflation|UK|13|1965|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for his first acoustic guitar, a [[Levin (guitar company)|Levin]], and was soon experimenting with [[open tuning]] and [[finger-picking]] techniques.<ref name=\"McGrath\">McGrath, T.J. \"Darkness Can Give You the Brightest Light\", ''[[Dirty Linen]]'', Issue 42, October/November 1992.</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Drake enrolled at a [[Cram school|tutorial college]] in [[Five Ways, Birmingham]], where he won a scholarship to study at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]].<ref>Dann (2006), 110\u2013111.</ref> He delayed attendance to spend six months at the [[Aix-Marseille University|University of Aix-Marseille]], France, beginning in February 1967, where he began to practise guitar in earnest.

He began performing in local clubs and coffee houses around London, and in February 1968, while playing support to [[Country Joe and the Fish]] at [[Roundhouse (venue)|the Roundhouse]] in [[Camden Town]], made an impression on [[Ashley Hutchings]], bass player with [[Fairport Convention]].<ref name=\"Chronology\">\"[http://www.uow.edu.au/~morgan/drake2.htm Nick Drake\u2014Chronology\"].

Impressed by a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track]] demo recorded in Drake's college room in early 1968, Boyd offered Drake a management, publishing, and production contract. According to Boyd:<blockquote>In those days you didn't have cassettes\u2014he brought a reel-to-reel tape [to me] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, \"I'd like to make a record.\" He stammered, \"Oh, well, yeah. Okay.\" Nick was a man of few words.<ref name=\"Paphides\"/></blockquote>According to Drake's friend Paul Wheeler, Drake had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge and was excited by the contract.<ref name=\"Paphides\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===''Five Leaves Left'' (1969)===\nDrake recorded his debut album ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'' later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. He had to skip lectures to travel by train to the sessions in [[Sound Techniques (studio)|Sound Techniques studio]], London. Inspired by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]]'s production of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s album ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'', Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \"with no shiny pop [[reverberation|reverb]]\".<ref name=\"b192\">Boyd (2006), 192.</ref> He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \"without overwhelming&nbsp;... or sounding cheesy\".<ref name=\"b192\"/> To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London [[folk rock]] scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] bassist [[Danny Thompson]] (no relation).<ref name=\"inkblot\">Rosen, Dave. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014082115/http://inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/drake.htm Five Leaves Left\"], ''Ink Blot Magazine''. Retrieved 2 March 2014.</ref>\n\nInitial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their ''[[Unhalfbricking]]'' album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of [[George Martin]]'s approach of using the [[studio as an instrument]], while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann observed that Drake appears \"tight and anxious\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation.<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Both were unhappy with arranger [[Richard Anthony Hewson]]'s contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 60.</ref> Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement.

His father remembered \"writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge&nbsp;... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want.\"<ref name=\"ASTF\"/> Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's [[Kensington]] flat but usually sleeping on friends' sofas and floors.<ref>Humphries (1997), pp. 107\u201308.</ref> Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor [[bedsit]] in [[Belsize Park]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]].<ref>Dann (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nOn 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the [[BBC]]'s [[John Peel|John Peel show]] (\"Cello Song\", \"Three Hours\", \"River Man\", \"Time of No Reply\" and an early version of \"Bryter Layter\"), three of which were broadcast the following night. A month later, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Folk singer [[Michael Chapman (singer)|Michael Chapman]] said of the performances:<blockquote>The folkies did not take to him; [they] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point.

I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig!<ref name=\"Chronology\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience.

The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further [[major depressive disorder|depression]].

In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at [[North East Surrey College Of Technology|Ewell Technical College]], Surrey. [[Ralph McTell]], who also performed that night, remembered: \"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened.

The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974.

Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a \"crash back into despair\". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake \"making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death\".<ref>Boyd (2006), pp. 260\u201361.</ref> Writing in 1975, ''[[NME]]'' journalist [[Nick Kent]] commented on the irony of Drake's death at a time when he had just begun to regain a sense of \"personal balance\".<ref name=\"NKent\"/> In contrast, Gabrielle said \"I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake.

Unterberger felt that Drake's following spanned generations \"in the manner of the young [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets of the 19th century who died before their time ... [[Baby boomer]]s who missed him the first time around found much to revisit once they discovered him, and his pensive loneliness speaks directly to contemporary alternative rockers who share his sense of morose alienation.\"<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\n[[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981): \"I'm not inclined to revere suicides.

Although his music did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, he gradually achieved wider recognition and is now considered among the most influential English singer-songwriters of the last 50 years. Drake signed to [[Island Records]] when he was 20 years old and released his debut album, ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'', in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums: ''[[Bryter Layter]]'' and ''[[Pink Moon]]''. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release.<ref>However, BBC article by Mark Moxon from 14 January 2002 states that \"The album only sold 15,000 copies, which was enough to please the record company, but nothing like the success Nick was hoping for\".[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A662924]</ref>\n\nDrake's reluctance to perform live or be interviewed contributed to his lack of commercial success. He suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[insomnia]], topics often reflected in his lyrics. After completing ''Pink Moon'' in 1972, he withdrew from live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, at the age of 26, Drake died from an [[overdose]] of [[amitriptyline]], a prescribed [[antidepressant]].\n\nThe 1979 release of the retrospective album ''[[Fruit Tree (Nick Drake album)|Fruit Tree]]'' triggered a reassessment of Drake's catalogue. By the mid-1980s, artists such as [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]], [[David Sylvian]] and [[Peter Buck]] were crediting Drake as an influence. In 1985, the [[The Dream Academy|Dream Academy]] reached the UK and US charts with \"[[Life in a Northern Town]]\", dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, Drake had come to represent the \"doomed romantic\" musician in the UK music press, and was being cited by artists including [[Kate Bush]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] and the [[The Black Crowes|Black Crowes]]. The first Drake biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary ''A Stranger Among Us''. In 2000, the title track from ''Pink Moon'' appeared in a [[Volkswagen]] advertisement, and within a month Drake had sold more records than he had in the previous 30 years.\n\n== 1948\u20131966: Early life ==\nDrake's father, Rodney Shuttleworth Drake (1908\u20131988), moved to [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], in the early 1930s to work as an engineer with the [[Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation]].<ref>Dann (2006), 75.</ref> In 1934, Rodney met Nick's mother, [[Molly Drake|Molly Lloyd]] (1916\u20131993), the daughter of a senior member of the [[Indian Civil Service]].

Five years later, he went to [[Marlborough College]], a [[Public school (UK)|public school]] in [[Wiltshire]] attended by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished sprinter over 100 and 200 yards, representing the school's Open Team in 1966.

He formed a band, the Perfumed Gardeners, with four schoolmates in 1964 or 1965.

Impressed by a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track]] demo recorded in Drake's college room in early 1968, Boyd offered Drake a management, publishing, and production contract. According to Boyd:<blockquote>In those days you didn't have cassettes\u2014he brought a reel-to-reel tape [to me] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special.

He had to skip lectures to travel by train to the sessions in [[Sound Techniques (studio)|Sound Techniques studio]], London. Inspired by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]]'s production of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s album ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'', Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \"with no shiny pop [[reverberation|reverb]]\".<ref name=\"b192\">Boyd (2006), 192.</ref> He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \"without overwhelming&nbsp;... or sounding cheesy\".<ref name=\"b192\"/> To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London [[folk rock]] scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] bassist [[Danny Thompson]] (no relation).<ref name=\"inkblot\">Rosen, Dave. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014082115/http://inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/drake.htm Five Leaves Left\"], ''Ink Blot Magazine''.

Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of [[George Martin]]'s approach of using the [[studio as an instrument]], while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann observed that Drake appears \"tight and anxious\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation.<ref>Dann (2006), pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Both were unhappy with arranger [[Richard Anthony Hewson]]'s contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs.<ref>Dann (2006), p. 60.</ref> Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement.

A month later, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Folk singer [[Michael Chapman (singer)|Michael Chapman]] said of the performances:<blockquote>The folkies did not take to him; [they] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point.

The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at [[North East Surrey College Of Technology|Ewell Technical College]], Surrey. [[Ralph McTell]], who also performed that night, remembered: \"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened.

Unterberger felt that Drake's following spanned generations \"in the manner of the young [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets of the 19th century who died before their time ... [[Baby boomer]]s who missed him the first time around found much to revisit once they discovered him, and his pensive loneliness speaks directly to contemporary alternative rockers who share his sense of morose alienation.\"<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\n[[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981): \"I'm not inclined to revere suicides.

Although there've been a few exceptions, I've never been attracted to hypersensitives or depressives, and Drake is both.\"<ref name=\"Xgau\"/>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{main|Nick Drake discography}}\n* ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Bryter Layter]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[Pink Moon]]'' (1972)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Joe Boyd|Boyd, Joe]] (2006).

It was bordered by [[Mexico]] to the west and southwest, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the southeast, the two [[U.S. state]]s of [[Louisiana]] and [[Arkansas]] to the east and northeast, and [[Territories of the United States|United States territories]] encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], and [[New Mexico]] to the north and west. The citizens of the republic were known as [[Texians]].\n\nThe region of the Mexican state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]], now commonly referred to as [[Mexican Texas]], declared its independence from Mexico during the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1835\u20131836, when the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico]] abolished autonomy from states of the [[First Mexican Republic|Mexican federal republic]]. The major fighting in the Texas war of independence ended on April 21, 1836, but the Mexican Congress refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas, since the [[Treaties of Velasco|agreement]] that Mexican President, General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], signed under duress as prisoner of the Texians. There were intermittent conflicts between Mexico and Texas into the 1840s. The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory.<ref name=\"henderson121\">Henderson (2008), p. 121.</ref>\n\nThe Republic-claimed borders were based upon the [[Treaties of Velasco]] between the newly created Texas Republic and General Santa Anna, who had been captured in battle. The eastern boundary had been defined by the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819 between the United States and [[Spain]], which recognized the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] as the eastern boundary of [[Spanish Texas]] and western boundary of the [[Missouri Territory]]. Under the 1819 Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1819, before Mexico's 1821 independence, the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and to the north of the [[Rio Grande]], which it claimed to have acquired as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.\n\nThe republic's southern and western boundary with Mexico was disputed throughout the republic's existence, since Mexico disputed the independence of Texas. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary, while Mexico insisted that the [[Nueces River]] was the boundary. In practice, much of the disputed territory was [[Comancheria|occupied by the Comanche]] and outside the control of either state, but Texian claims included the eastern portions of [[Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_M\u00e9xico#Mexican_territory|New Mexico]], which was administered by Mexico throughout this period. \n\n[[Texas annexation|Texas was annexed]] by the United States on December 29, 1845 and was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on that day, with the transfer of power from the Republic to the new state of [[Texas]] formally taking place on February 19, 1846.<ref name=\"Himmel1999\">{{cite book|author=Kelly F.

One of these, the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] (also known as the Republican Army of the North) consisted of a group of about 130 Americans under the leadership of [[Bernardo Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara]]. Gutierrez de Lara initiated Mexico's secession from Spain with efforts contributed by [[Augustus Magee]]. Bolstered by new recruits, and led by [[Samuel Kemper]] (who succeeded Magee after his death in battle in 1813), the expedition gained a series of victories against soldiers led by the Spanish governor, [[Manuel Mar\u00eda de Salcedo]]. \n\nTheir victory at the [[Battle of Rosillo Creek]] convinced Salcedo to surrender on April 1, 1813; he was executed two days later. On April 6, 1813, the victorious Republican Army of the North drafted a constitution and declared the independent Republic of Texas, with Guti\u00e9rrez as its president.<ref>Weber (1992), p. 299.</ref> Soon disillusioned with the Mexican leadership, the Americans under Kemper returned to the United States. \n\nThe ephemeral Republic of Texas came to an end on August 18, 1813, with the [[Battle of Medina]], where the Spanish Army crushed the Republican Army of the North. The harsh reprisals against the Texas rebels created a deep distrust of the Royal Spanish authorities, and veterans of the Battle of Medina later became leaders of the [[Texas Revolution]] and signatories of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] from Mexico 20 years later.\n\nAfter the failure of the Expedition, there would be no serious push for a \"Republic of Texas\" for another six years, until 1819, when Virginian filibuster Dr. [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]] invaded Spanish Texas in an attempt to liberate the region.\n\nEli Harris led 120 men across the Sabine River to Nacogdoches. Long followed two weeks later with an additional 75 men. On June 22, the combined force declared a new government, with Long as president and a 21-member Supreme Council. The following day, they issued a declaration of independence, modeled on the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The document cited several grievances, including \"Spanish rapacity\" and \"odious tyranny\" and promised religious freedom, freedom of the press, and free trade. The council also allocated 10 square miles of land to each member of the expedition, and authorized the sale of additional land to raise cash for the fledgling government. Within a month, the expedition had grown to 300 members.\n\nThe new government established trading outposts near Anahuac along the Trinity River and the Brazos River. They also began the first English-language newspaper ever published in Texas, so named the ''Texas Republican'', which existed only for the month of August 1819.\n\nLong also contacted Jean Lafitte, who ran a large smuggling operation on Galveston Island. His letter suggested that the new government establish an admiralty court at Galveston, and offered to appoint Lafitte governor of Galveston. Unbeknownst to Long, Lafitte was actually a Spanish spy. While making numerous promises\u2013and excuses\u2013to Long, Lafitte gathered information about the expedition and passed it on to Spanish authorities. By July 16, the Spanish Consul in New Orleans had warned the viceroy in Mexico City that \"I am fully persuaded that the present is the most serious expedition that has threatened the Kingdom\".\n\nWith Lafitte's lack of assistance, the expedition soon ran low on provisions. Long dispersed his men to forage for food. Discipline began to break down, and many men, including Bowie, returned home. In early October, Lafitte reached an agreement with Long to make Galveston an official port for the new country and name Lafitte governor. Within weeks, 500 Spanish troops arrived in Texas and marched on Nacogdoches. Long and his men withdrew. Over 40 men were captured. Long escaped to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Others fled to Galveston and settled along Bolivar Peninsula.\n\nUndeterred in his defeat, Dr. Long returned once more in 1820, Long joined the refugees at Bolivar Peninsula on April 6, 1820, with more reinforcements. He continued to raise money to equip a second expedition. Fifty men attempted to join him from the United States, but they were arrested by American authorities as they tried to cross into Texas. The men who had joined Long were disappointed they were paid in scrip, and they gradually began to desert. By December 1820, Long commanded only 50 men.\n\nWith the aid of Ben Milam and others, Long revitalized the Supreme Council. He later broke with Milam, and the expedition led an uncertain existence until September 19, 1821, when Long and 52 men marched inland to capture Presidio La Bah\u00eda. The town fell easily on October 4, but four days later Long was forced to surrender by Spanish troops. He was taken prisoner and sent to Mexico City, where about six months later he was shot and killed by a guard \u2013 reportedly bribed to do so by Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Trespalacios, thus ending the Long Expeditions.\n\nAlong with the rest of Mexico, Texas gained its independence from Spain in 1821 following the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], and the new Mexican state was organized under the [[Plan of Iguala]], which created Mexico as a [[constitutional monarchy]] under its first Emperor [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. During the transition from a Spanish territory to a part of the independent country of Mexico, [[Stephen F. Austin]] led a group of American settlers known as the [[Old Three Hundred]], who negotiated the right to settle in Texas with the Spanish Royal governor of the territory. Since Mexican independence had been ratified by Spain shortly thereafter, Austin later traveled to Mexico City to secure the support of the new country for his right to settle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Edmondson|first=J.R.|title=The Alamo Story-From History to Current Conflicts|publisher=Republic of Texas Press|place=[[Plano, TX]]|isbn=1-55622-678-0|year=2000|page=63}}</ref> The establishment of [[Mexican Texas]] coincided with the Austin-led settlement, leading to animosity between Mexican authorities and ongoing American settlement of Texas. The [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, being replaced by a republican form of government in 1823. In 1824, the sparsely populated territories of Texas and [[Coahuila]] were joined to form the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The capital was controversially located in southern Coahuila, the part farthest from Texas.\n\nFollowing Austin's lead, additional groups of settlers, known as [[Empresario]]s, continued to colonize Mexican Texas from the United States. A spike in the price of cotton, and the success of plantations in Mississippi encouraged large numbers of white Americans to migrate to Texas and obtain slaves to try to replicate the business model.<ref name=\"seeds\" /> In 1830, Mexican President [[Anastasio Bustamante]] outlawed American immigration to Texas, following several conflicts with the Empresarios over the status of slavery, which had been abolished in Mexico in 1829, but which the Texans refused to end.<ref>Robert A.

Mexican President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] revoked the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]] and began to consolidate power in the central government under his own leadership. In 1835, the central government split Texas and Coahuila into two separate departments. The [[Texian]] leadership under Austin began to organize its own military, and hostilities broke out on October 2, 1835, at the [[Battle of Gonzales]], the first engagement of the Texas Revolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardin|first=Stephen L.|authorlink= Stephen L.

The nationalist faction, led by Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (Indians), and the expansion of Texas to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Their opponents, led by Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful coexistence with the Indians, when possible.

After [[Council House Fight|peace talks]] in 1840 ended with the massacre of 34 Comanche leaders in [[San Antonio]], the Comanches launched a major attack deep into Texas, known as the [[Great Raid of 1840]]. Under command of Potsanaquahip ([[Buffalo Hump]]), 500 to 700 Comanche cavalry warriors swept down the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] valley, killing and plundering all the way to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, where they sacked the towns of [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]] and [[Linnville, Calhoun County, Texas|Linnville]].

On March 1, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John Tyler]] signed the bill. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. Faced with imminent American annexation of Texas, [[Charles Elliot]] and Alphonse de Saligny, the British and French ministers to Texas, were dispatched to Mexico City by their governments. Meeting with Mexico's foreign secretary, they signed a \"Diplomatic Act\" in which Mexico offered to recognize an independent Texas with boundaries determined with French and British mediation. Texas President [[Anson Jones]] forwarded both offers to a specially elected convention meeting at Austin, and the American proposal was accepted with only one dissenting vote. The Mexican proposal was never put to a vote. Following the previous decree of President Jones, the proposal was then put to a vote throughout the republic.\n\n[[File:Texas Statehood 1945 Issue-3c.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Postage stamp issued on the 100th anniversary of Texas statehood, 1945]]\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|right|Proposals for Texas's north and west boundaries in 1850 debate]]\n\nOn October 13, 1845, a large majority of voters in the republic approved both the American offer and the proposed constitution that specifically endorsed [[slavery]] and emigrants bringing slaves to Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1845/a8 |title=Article VIII: Slaves - Constitution of Texas (1845) (Joining the U.S.) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116142228/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1845/a8 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}</ref> This constitution was later accepted by the US Congress, making Texas a US state on the same day annexation took effect, December 29, 1845 (therefore bypassing a [[territory of the United States|territorial]] phase).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/texan04.htm|title=The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205031127/http://yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/texan04.htm|archivedate=December 5, 2006}}</ref> One of the motivations for annexation was the huge debts which the Republic of Texas government had incurred. As part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], in return for $10,000,000 in Federal bonds, Texas dropped claims to territory that included parts of present-day [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Wyoming]].\n\nThe resolution did include two unique provisions: First, it said up to four additional states could be created from Texas' territory with the consent of the State of Texas (and that new states north of the [[Missouri Compromise Line]] would be [[Slave and free states|free states]]). Though the resolution did not make exceptions to the constitution,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/annexation/march1845.html|title=Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States Approved March 1, 1845 - TSLAC|publisher=}}</ref> the U.S. Constitution does not require Congressional consent to the creation of new states to be ''ex post'' to applications, nor does the U.S. Constitution require applications to expire. To illustrate the strength of the latter caveat, [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the 27th Amendment]] was submitted to the states in 1789, yet was not ratified until 1992\u2014thus, the expressed consent of Congress, via this resolution, to the creation of new states would not expire nor require renewal. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. Consequently, the lands in Texas that the federal government owns are those it subsequently purchased. This also means the state government controls [[oil reserves]], which it later used to fund the state's public university system through the [[Permanent University Fund]].<ref>[http://www2.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/annexation/part5/question8.html Texas Annexation : Questions and Answers], Texas State Library & Archives Commission.</ref> In addition, the state's control over offshore oil reserves in Texas runs out to 3 [[nautical league]]s (9 nautical miles, 10.357 statute miles, 16.668&nbsp;km) rather than three nautical miles (3.45 statute miles, 5.56&nbsp;km) as with other states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/FTProot/pub/|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/363/1/|title=United States v.

It was bordered by [[Mexico]] to the west and southwest, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the southeast, the two [[U.S. state]]s of [[Louisiana]] and [[Arkansas]] to the east and northeast, and [[Territories of the United States|United States territories]] encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], and [[New Mexico]] to the north and west. The citizens of the republic were known as [[Texians]].\n\nThe region of the Mexican state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]], now commonly referred to as [[Mexican Texas]], declared its independence from Mexico during the [[Texas Revolution]] in 1835\u20131836, when the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico]] abolished autonomy from states of the [[First Mexican Republic|Mexican federal republic]]. The major fighting in the Texas war of independence ended on April 21, 1836, but the Mexican Congress refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas, since the [[Treaties of Velasco|agreement]] that Mexican President, General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], signed under duress as prisoner of the Texians. There were intermittent conflicts between Mexico and Texas into the 1840s. The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory.<ref name=\"henderson121\">Henderson (2008), p. 121.</ref>\n\nThe Republic-claimed borders were based upon the [[Treaties of Velasco]] between the newly created Texas Republic and General Santa Anna, who had been captured in battle. The eastern boundary had been defined by the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819 between the United States and [[Spain]], which recognized the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] as the eastern boundary of [[Spanish Texas]] and western boundary of the [[Missouri Territory]]. Under the 1819 Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1819, before Mexico's 1821 independence, the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and to the north of the [[Rio Grande]], which it claimed to have acquired as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.\n\nThe republic's southern and western boundary with Mexico was disputed throughout the republic's existence, since Mexico disputed the independence of Texas. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary, while Mexico insisted that the [[Nueces River]] was the boundary. In practice, much of the disputed territory was [[Comancheria|occupied by the Comanche]] and outside the control of either state, but Texian claims included the eastern portions of [[Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_M\u00e9xico#Mexican_territory|New Mexico]], which was administered by Mexico throughout this period. \n\n[[Texas annexation|Texas was annexed]] by the United States on December 29, 1845 and was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on that day, with the transfer of power from the Republic to the new state of [[Texas]] formally taking place on February 19, 1846.<ref name=\"Himmel1999\">{{cite book|author=Kelly F.

Many Americans fought on the side of Mexico against Spain in [[Filibuster (military)|filibustering]] expeditions. One of these, the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] (also known as the Republican Army of the North) consisted of a group of about 130 Americans under the leadership of [[Bernardo Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara]]. Gutierrez de Lara initiated Mexico's secession from Spain with efforts contributed by [[Augustus Magee]]. Bolstered by new recruits, and led by [[Samuel Kemper]] (who succeeded Magee after his death in battle in 1813), the expedition gained a series of victories against soldiers led by the Spanish governor, [[Manuel Mar\u00eda de Salcedo]]. \n\nTheir victory at the [[Battle of Rosillo Creek]] convinced Salcedo to surrender on April 1, 1813; he was executed two days later. On April 6, 1813, the victorious Republican Army of the North drafted a constitution and declared the independent Republic of Texas, with Guti\u00e9rrez as its president.<ref>Weber (1992), p. 299.</ref> Soon disillusioned with the Mexican leadership, the Americans under Kemper returned to the United States. \n\nThe ephemeral Republic of Texas came to an end on August 18, 1813, with the [[Battle of Medina]], where the Spanish Army crushed the Republican Army of the North. The harsh reprisals against the Texas rebels created a deep distrust of the Royal Spanish authorities, and veterans of the Battle of Medina later became leaders of the [[Texas Revolution]] and signatories of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] from Mexico 20 years later.\n\nAfter the failure of the Expedition, there would be no serious push for a \"Republic of Texas\" for another six years, until 1819, when Virginian filibuster Dr. [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]] invaded Spanish Texas in an attempt to liberate the region.\n\nEli Harris led 120 men across the Sabine River to Nacogdoches. Long followed two weeks later with an additional 75 men. On June 22, the combined force declared a new government, with Long as president and a 21-member Supreme Council. The following day, they issued a declaration of independence, modeled on the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The document cited several grievances, including \"Spanish rapacity\" and \"odious tyranny\" and promised religious freedom, freedom of the press, and free trade. The council also allocated 10 square miles of land to each member of the expedition, and authorized the sale of additional land to raise cash for the fledgling government. Within a month, the expedition had grown to 300 members.\n\nThe new government established trading outposts near Anahuac along the Trinity River and the Brazos River. They also began the first English-language newspaper ever published in Texas, so named the ''Texas Republican'', which existed only for the month of August 1819.\n\nLong also contacted Jean Lafitte, who ran a large smuggling operation on Galveston Island. His letter suggested that the new government establish an admiralty court at Galveston, and offered to appoint Lafitte governor of Galveston. Unbeknownst to Long, Lafitte was actually a Spanish spy. While making numerous promises\u2013and excuses\u2013to Long, Lafitte gathered information about the expedition and passed it on to Spanish authorities. By July 16, the Spanish Consul in New Orleans had warned the viceroy in Mexico City that \"I am fully persuaded that the present is the most serious expedition that has threatened the Kingdom\".\n\nWith Lafitte's lack of assistance, the expedition soon ran low on provisions. Long dispersed his men to forage for food. Discipline began to break down, and many men, including Bowie, returned home. In early October, Lafitte reached an agreement with Long to make Galveston an official port for the new country and name Lafitte governor. Within weeks, 500 Spanish troops arrived in Texas and marched on Nacogdoches. Long and his men withdrew. Over 40 men were captured. Long escaped to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Others fled to Galveston and settled along Bolivar Peninsula.\n\nUndeterred in his defeat, Dr. Long returned once more in 1820, Long joined the refugees at Bolivar Peninsula on April 6, 1820, with more reinforcements. He continued to raise money to equip a second expedition. Fifty men attempted to join him from the United States, but they were arrested by American authorities as they tried to cross into Texas. The men who had joined Long were disappointed they were paid in scrip, and they gradually began to desert. By December 1820, Long commanded only 50 men.\n\nWith the aid of Ben Milam and others, Long revitalized the Supreme Council. He later broke with Milam, and the expedition led an uncertain existence until September 19, 1821, when Long and 52 men marched inland to capture Presidio La Bah\u00eda. The town fell easily on October 4, but four days later Long was forced to surrender by Spanish troops. He was taken prisoner and sent to Mexico City, where about six months later he was shot and killed by a guard \u2013 reportedly bribed to do so by Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Trespalacios, thus ending the Long Expeditions.\n\nAlong with the rest of Mexico, Texas gained its independence from Spain in 1821 following the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], and the new Mexican state was organized under the [[Plan of Iguala]], which created Mexico as a [[constitutional monarchy]] under its first Emperor [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. During the transition from a Spanish territory to a part of the independent country of Mexico, [[Stephen F. Austin]] led a group of American settlers known as the [[Old Three Hundred]], who negotiated the right to settle in Texas with the Spanish Royal governor of the territory. Since Mexican independence had been ratified by Spain shortly thereafter, Austin later traveled to Mexico City to secure the support of the new country for his right to settle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Edmondson|first=J.R.|title=The Alamo Story-From History to Current Conflicts|publisher=Republic of Texas Press|place=[[Plano, TX]]|isbn=1-55622-678-0|year=2000|page=63}}</ref> The establishment of [[Mexican Texas]] coincided with the Austin-led settlement, leading to animosity between Mexican authorities and ongoing American settlement of Texas. The [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, being replaced by a republican form of government in 1823. In 1824, the sparsely populated territories of Texas and [[Coahuila]] were joined to form the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The capital was controversially located in southern Coahuila, the part farthest from Texas.\n\nFollowing Austin's lead, additional groups of settlers, known as [[Empresario]]s, continued to colonize Mexican Texas from the United States. A spike in the price of cotton, and the success of plantations in Mississippi encouraged large numbers of white Americans to migrate to Texas and obtain slaves to try to replicate the business model.<ref name=\"seeds\" /> In 1830, Mexican President [[Anastasio Bustamante]] outlawed American immigration to Texas, following several conflicts with the Empresarios over the status of slavery, which had been abolished in Mexico in 1829, but which the Texans refused to end.<ref>Robert A. Calvert,  Arnoldo De Leon, and Gregg Cantrell, ''The history of Texas'' (2014) pp 64-74.</ref> Texans replaced slavery with long-term [[indentured servitude]] contracts signed by \"liberated\" slaves in the United States to work around the abolition of slavery. Angered at the interference of the Mexican government, the Empresarios held the [[Convention of 1832]], which was the first formal step in what became the [[Texas Revolution]].<ref>Eugene C. Barker, ''The Life of Stephen F. Austin, Founder of Texas'' (2010) pp 348-50.</ref>\n\nBy 1834, the American settlers in the area outnumbered Mexicans by a considerable margin.<ref>Manchaca (2001), pp. 172, 201.</ref> Following a [[Anahuac Disturbances|series of minor skirmishes]] between Mexican authorities and the settlers, the Mexican government, fearing open rebellion of their [[Anglo#United States|Anglo]] subjects, began to step up military presence in Texas throughout 1834 and early 1835. Mexican President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] revoked the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]] and began to consolidate power in the central government under his own leadership. In 1835, the central government split Texas and Coahuila into two separate departments. The [[Texian]] leadership under Austin began to organize its own military, and hostilities broke out on October 2, 1835, at the [[Battle of Gonzales]], the first engagement of the Texas Revolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardin|first=Stephen L.|authorlink= Stephen L.

Austin]], known as the ''[[Father of Texas]]'', died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as [[Secretary of State]] for the new Republic.\n\nIn 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas ([[Washington-on-the-Brazos]], [[Harrisburg, Texas|Harrisburg]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]] and [[Columbia, Texas|Columbia]]), before [[President of the Republic of Texas|President]] [[Sam Houston]] moved the capital to [[Houston]] in 1837. The next president, [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], moved the capital to the new town of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in 1839.\n\nThe first flag of the republic was the \"[[Burnet Flag]]\" (a single gold star on an azure field), followed in 1839 by official adoption of the Lone Star Flag.\n\nInternal politics of the Republic centered on two factions. The nationalist faction, led by Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (Indians), and the expansion of Texas to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Their opponents, led by Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful coexistence with the Indians, when possible.

In retaliation, the Comanches attacked Texas in a series of raids. After [[Council House Fight|peace talks]] in 1840 ended with the massacre of 34 Comanche leaders in [[San Antonio]], the Comanches launched a major attack deep into Texas, known as the [[Great Raid of 1840]]. Under command of Potsanaquahip ([[Buffalo Hump]]), 500 to 700 Comanche cavalry warriors swept down the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] valley, killing and plundering all the way to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, where they sacked the towns of [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]] and [[Linnville, Calhoun County, Texas|Linnville]].

[[Stephen F. Austin]], often referred to as the \"Father of Texas,\" died on December 27, 1836, after serving just two months as the republic's secretary of state. Due mainly to the ongoing war for independence, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas in 1836: ([[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]], [[Harrisburg, Texas|Harrisburg]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]] and Columbia). The capital was moved to the new city of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in 1837.\n\nIn 1839, a small pioneer settlement situated on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] in central Texas was chosen as the republic's seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town was renamed [[Austin]] shortly thereafter in honor of Stephen F. Austin.\n\nThe court system inaugurated by Congress included a [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas|Supreme Court]] consisting of a chief justice appointed by the president and four associate justices, elected by a joint ballot of both houses of Congress for four-year terms and eligible for re-election. The associates also presided over four judicial districts. Houston nominated [[James Collinsworth]] to be the first chief justice. The county-court system consisted of a chief justice and two associates, chosen by a majority of the justices of the peace in the county. Each county was also to have a sheriff, a coroner, justices of the peace, and constables to serve two-year terms. Congress formed 23 counties, whose boundaries generally coincided with the existing municipalities. In 1839, Texas became the first nation in the world to enact a [[homestead exemption]], under which creditors cannot seize a person's primary residence.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Baylor University 1892 front.png|left|thumb|[[Baylor University]], 1892 lithograph]]\n\nPresident [[Anson Jones]] signed the charter for [[Baylor University]] in the fall of 1845.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.baylor.edu/baylorproud/2016/02/is-baylor-the-oldest-university-in-texas/|title=Is Baylor the oldest university in Texas?|date=February 1, 2016}}</ref> [[Henry Lee Graves]] was elected Baylor's first president.

Faced with imminent American annexation of Texas, [[Charles Elliot]] and Alphonse de Saligny, the British and French ministers to Texas, were dispatched to Mexico City by their governments. Meeting with Mexico's foreign secretary, they signed a \"Diplomatic Act\" in which Mexico offered to recognize an independent Texas with boundaries determined with French and British mediation. Texas President [[Anson Jones]] forwarded both offers to a specially elected convention meeting at Austin, and the American proposal was accepted with only one dissenting vote. The Mexican proposal was never put to a vote. Following the previous decree of President Jones, the proposal was then put to a vote throughout the republic.\n\n[[File:Texas Statehood 1945 Issue-3c.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Postage stamp issued on the 100th anniversary of Texas statehood, 1945]]\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|right|Proposals for Texas's north and west boundaries in 1850 debate]]\n\nOn October 13, 1845, a large majority of voters in the republic approved both the American offer and the proposed constitution that specifically endorsed [[slavery]] and emigrants bringing slaves to Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1845/a8 |title=Article VIII: Slaves - Constitution of Texas (1845) (Joining the U.S.) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116142228/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/texas1845/a8 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}</ref> This constitution was later accepted by the US Congress, making Texas a US state on the same day annexation took effect, December 29, 1845 (therefore bypassing a [[territory of the United States|territorial]] phase).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/texan04.htm|title=The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205031127/http://yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/texan04.htm|archivedate=December 5, 2006}}</ref> One of the motivations for annexation was the huge debts which the Republic of Texas government had incurred. As part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], in return for $10,000,000 in Federal bonds, Texas dropped claims to territory that included parts of present-day [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Wyoming]].\n\nThe resolution did include two unique provisions: First, it said up to four additional states could be created from Texas' territory with the consent of the State of Texas (and that new states north of the [[Missouri Compromise Line]] would be [[Slave and free states|free states]]). Though the resolution did not make exceptions to the constitution,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/annexation/march1845.html|title=Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States Approved March 1, 1845 - TSLAC|publisher=}}</ref> the U.S. Constitution does not require Congressional consent to the creation of new states to be ''ex post'' to applications, nor does the U.S. Constitution require applications to expire. To illustrate the strength of the latter caveat, [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the 27th Amendment]] was submitted to the states in 1789, yet was not ratified until 1992\u2014thus, the expressed consent of Congress, via this resolution, to the creation of new states would not expire nor require renewal. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. Consequently, the lands in Texas that the federal government owns are those it subsequently purchased. This also means the state government controls [[oil reserves]], which it later used to fund the state's public university system through the [[Permanent University Fund]].<ref>[http://www2.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/annexation/part5/question8.html Texas Annexation : Questions and Answers], Texas State Library & Archives Commission.</ref> In addition, the state's control over offshore oil reserves in Texas runs out to 3 [[nautical league]]s (9 nautical miles, 10.357 statute miles, 16.668&nbsp;km) rather than three nautical miles (3.45 statute miles, 5.56&nbsp;km) as with other states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/FTProot/pub/|title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/363/1/|title=United States v.

The picardy third is [[absolute music]]'s happy ending.

An idea that was repeated as fact for some time, but turns out to have no provable basis, was that expounded by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his '' Dictionnaire de Musique'' (1767): that this form of ending survived longest in church music, and due to the great number of cathedrals in the historical French province of [[Picardy]]. More plausible is the idea that the North of France, and Flanders, were influential in the development of [[counterpoint|contrapuntal music]] in the fifteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nRobert Hall hypothesizes that, instead of deriving from the Picardy region of France, it comes from the Old French word \"picart\", meaning \"pointed\" or \"sharp\" in northern dialects, and thus refers to the musical sharp that transforms the minor third of the chord into a major third.<ref>Robert A. Hall, Jr., \"How Picard was the Picardy Third?\", ''Current Musicology'' 19 (1975): pp.&nbsp;78\u201380.</ref>\n\nIn [[medieval music]], such as that of [[Machaut]], neither major nor minor thirds were considered stable intervals, and so cadences were typically on open [[perfect fifth|fifth]]s. As a harmonic device, the Picardy third originated in Western music in the Renaissance era. By the early seventeenth century, its use had become established in practice in music that was both sacred (as in the Sch\u00fctz example above) and secular:\n[[File:Byrd Pavane 'The Earl of Salisbury', 1612 01.wav|233px|thumb|William Byrd, Pavane \"The Earl of Salisbury\", 1612]]\n[[File:Byrd Pavane 'The Earl of Salisbury', 1612 02.png|thumb|center|500px|[[William Byrd]], Pavane \"The Earl of Salisbury\", 1612 02]]\nExamples of the Picardy third can be found throughout the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] and his contemporaries, as well as earlier composers such as [[Thoinot Arbeau]] and [[John Blow]]. Many of Bach's minor key chorales end with a cadence featuring a final chord in the major:\n[[File:J.S.Bach, Jesu meine Freude, BWV817, mm.12-13.wav|233px|thumb|J. S. Bach, ''Jesu meine Freude'', BWV 81.7, mm. 12\u201313]]\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|center|300px|Picardy third, in blue, in Bach: ''[[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|Jesu, meine Freude]]'' (Jesus, My Joy), BWV 81.7, mm. 12\u201313.<ref>Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker, ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', eighth edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2009), p.&nbsp;74. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.</ref>]]\n\nIn his book ''Music and Sentiment'', [[Charles Rosen]] shows how Bach makes use of the fluctuations between minor and major to convey feeling in his music. Rosen singles out the Allemande from the keyboard [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita in B-flat, BWV 825]] to exemplify \"the range of expression then possible, the subtle variety of inflections of sentiment contained with a well-defined framework\". The following passage from the first half of the piece starts in F major, but then, in bar 15, \"Turning to the minor mode with a chromatic bass and then back to the major for the cadence adds still new intensity.\"<ref>[[Charles Rosen]], ''Music and Sentiment'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2010), p.&nbsp;45.</ref>\n[[File:Bach Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13-18.wav|233px|thumb|Bach, Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13\u201318]]\n[[File:Bach Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13-18.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13\u201318]]\n\nMany passages in Bach's religious works follow a similar expressive trajectory involving major and minor keys that may sometimes take on a symbolic significance. For example, David Humphreys (1983, p.&nbsp;23) sees the \"languishing chromatic inflections, syncopations and appoggiaturas\" of the following episode from the St Anne Prelude for organ, BWV 552 from ''[[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]]'' as \"showing Christ in his human aspect. Moreover the poignant angularity of the melody, and in particular the sudden turn to the minor, are obvious expressions of pathos, introduced as a portrayal of his Passion and crucifixion\":<ref>Humphreys, D.

Furthermore, I hypothesize that in gaining this expressive property of happiness or contentment, the picardy third augmented its power as the perfect, most stable cadential chord, being both the most emotionally consonant chord, so to speak, as well as the most musically consonant.<ref>[[Peter Kivy]], ''Osmin's Rage: Philosophical Reflections on Opera, Drama, and Text, with a New Final Chapter'' (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1999), p.&nbsp;289. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8589-3}}.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Deryck Cooke]], \"Western composers, expressing the 'rightness' of happiness by means of a major third, expressed the 'wrongness' of grief by means of the minor third, and for centuries, pieces in a minor key had to have a 'happy ending' \u2013 a final major chord (the 'tierce de Picardie') or a bare fifth.\"<ref>[[Deryck Cooke]], ''[[The Language of Music]]'' (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1959), p.&nbsp;57.</ref>\n\nThe Picardy third does not necessarily occur at the end of a section: it can be found at any perfect cadence or [[cadence (music)#Plagal cadence|plagal cadence]] where the prevailing [[key (music)|key]] is minor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} As a [[harmony|harmonic]] device, the Picardy third originated in Western music in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] era.\n\n==Illustration==\n[[File:Tierce de Picardie in ich habe genug.jpg|frame|none|From [[Ich habe genug, BWV 82|''Ich habe genug'', BWV 82]]]]\n\nWhat makes this a Picardy cadence is shown by the red natural sign.

An idea that was repeated as fact for some time, but turns out to have no provable basis, was that expounded by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his '' Dictionnaire de Musique'' (1767): that this form of ending survived longest in church music, and due to the great number of cathedrals in the historical French province of [[Picardy]]. More plausible is the idea that the North of France, and Flanders, were influential in the development of [[counterpoint|contrapuntal music]] in the fifteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nRobert Hall hypothesizes that, instead of deriving from the Picardy region of France, it comes from the Old French word \"picart\", meaning \"pointed\" or \"sharp\" in northern dialects, and thus refers to the musical sharp that transforms the minor third of the chord into a major third.<ref>Robert A. Hall, Jr., \"How Picard was the Picardy Third?\", ''Current Musicology'' 19 (1975): pp.&nbsp;78\u201380.</ref>\n\nIn [[medieval music]], such as that of [[Machaut]], neither major nor minor thirds were considered stable intervals, and so cadences were typically on open [[perfect fifth|fifth]]s. As a harmonic device, the Picardy third originated in Western music in the Renaissance era. By the early seventeenth century, its use had become established in practice in music that was both sacred (as in the Sch\u00fctz example above) and secular:\n[[File:Byrd Pavane 'The Earl of Salisbury', 1612 01.wav|233px|thumb|William Byrd, Pavane \"The Earl of Salisbury\", 1612]]\n[[File:Byrd Pavane 'The Earl of Salisbury', 1612 02.png|thumb|center|500px|[[William Byrd]], Pavane \"The Earl of Salisbury\", 1612 02]]\nExamples of the Picardy third can be found throughout the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] and his contemporaries, as well as earlier composers such as [[Thoinot Arbeau]] and [[John Blow]]. Many of Bach's minor key chorales end with a cadence featuring a final chord in the major:\n[[File:J.S.Bach, Jesu meine Freude, BWV817, mm.12-13.wav|233px|thumb|J. S. Bach, ''Jesu meine Freude'', BWV 81.7, mm. 12\u201313]]\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|center|300px|Picardy third, in blue, in Bach: ''[[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|Jesu, meine Freude]]'' (Jesus, My Joy), BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.<ref>Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker, ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', eighth edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2009), p.&nbsp;74. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.</ref>]]\n\nIn his book ''Music and Sentiment'', [[Charles Rosen]] shows how Bach makes use of the fluctuations between minor and major to convey feeling in his music. Rosen singles out the Allemande from the keyboard [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita in B-flat, BWV 825]] to exemplify \"the range of expression then possible, the subtle variety of inflections of sentiment contained with a well-defined framework\". The following passage from the first half of the piece starts in F major, but then, in bar 15, \"Turning to the minor mode with a chromatic bass and then back to the major for the cadence adds still new intensity.\"<ref>[[Charles Rosen]], ''Music and Sentiment'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2010), p.&nbsp;45.</ref>\n[[File:Bach Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13-18.wav|233px|thumb|Bach, Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13\u201318]]\n[[File:Bach Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13-18.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach Allemande from Partita 1, bars 13\u201318]]\n\nMany passages in Bach's religious works follow a similar expressive trajectory involving major and minor keys that may sometimes take on a symbolic significance. For example, David Humphreys (1983, p.&nbsp;23) sees the \"languishing chromatic inflections, syncopations and appoggiaturas\" of the following episode from the St Anne Prelude for organ, BWV 552 from ''[[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]]'' as \"showing Christ in his human aspect. Moreover the poignant angularity of the melody, and in particular the sudden turn to the minor, are obvious expressions of pathos, introduced as a portrayal of his Passion and crucifixion\":<ref>Humphreys, D. (1983). ''The Esoteric structure of Bach's Clavier\u00fcbung III'', p.&nbsp;25. University of Cardiff Press.</ref>\n[[File:From Bach \"St Anne\" Prelude for Organ, BWV552, bars 118-130.wav|thumb|233px|From Bach \"St Anne\" Prelude for Organ, BWV 552, bars 118\u2013130]]\n[[File:From Bach \"St Anne\" Prelude for Organ, BWV552, bars 118-130.png|thumb|center|500px|From Bach \"St Anne\" Prelude for Organ, BWV 552, bars 118\u2013130]]\n\nNotably, Bach's two books of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', composed in 1722 and 1744 respectively, differ considerably in their application of Picardy thirds, which occur unambiguously at the end of all of the minor-mode preludes and all but one of the minor-mode fugues in the first book.<ref>Butler, H.

The judicial body ruled that all Garavito's sentences total 1,853 years and nine days in jail.\n\n==Early life==\nThough Garavito's mother is unknown, it had been speculated from the community of G\u00e9nova that Garavito's mother had been a long-time prostitute. During the time of working as a prostitute, Garavito's mother had been brutally abused by Garavito's father, who was a heavy alcoholic and would also abuse Garavito's siblings. Around this time, Garavito's father would force Garavito to watch his mother conduct in sexual intercourse with her clients, letting his mother's clients sexually abuse and molest Garavito. Under the influence of drugs, Garavito's mother would not do anything due to the abuse and torture of Garavito's alcoholic father. Garavito eventually ran away from home and survived on the Colombian streets. At the age of eight, Garavito was found by a paedophile. The man promised Garavito a hot meal and a place to rest; reluctantly, Garavito accepted the offer, but instead of the hot meal and a place to sleep, the man led Garavito to an abandoned house where Garavito was sexually assaulted. A few days after, Garavito then joined a rebellious gang for protection. The gang often robbed the Colombian civilians for food, money, and cars, which they exchanged for money at local chop shops.<ref>https://historycollection.co/luis-beast-garavito-worst-serial-killer-history/\n\n</ref>\n\nGaravito started working as soon as he \"earned\" enough money to survive on the streets,<ref>https://allthatsinteresting.com/luis-garavito\n\n</ref> travelling a substantial amount to keep up with the job demands in Colombia. Although he frequently moved, Garavito had a girlfriend named Teresa. His girlfriend had a small child which she recalls him getting along with very well. Garavito was known by his friends to be kind, yet easily angered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Victim type and killing patterns==\nGaravito's victims were clearly identified by their age, gender, and social status. Garavito targeted boys between the ages of 6 to 16 who were either homeless, peasants, or [[orphaned]]. He would approach the young boys, either on the crowded streets or alone in the countryside, and lure them away by [[bribing]] them with small gifts such as money, candy or [[Temporary work|odd jobs]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|title=World: Americas: Colombian child killer confesses|publisher=BBC Online Network|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/493887.stm|date=30 October 1999|accessdate=20 June 2010|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125035117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/493887.stm#|archive-date=25 January 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He offered easy work for money and even [[disguised]] himself as different characters who could be seen as legitimately offering work to the boy, such as a priest, a farmer, a homeless man, a street vendor, a drug dealer, an elderly man, and a [[gambler]].<ref name=Discovery>{{cite web|title=Serial Killer Documentary Luis Alfredo Garavito|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWw42vTHMdc|website=Discovery Channel|publisher=Discovery Channel|date=1 September 2016|access-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410172530/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWw42vTHMdc#|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> To prevent suspicions about his activities from developing, Garavito would change his disguise often.\n\nOnce he had the trust of a child, Garavito would walk with the boy until they were tired and vulnerable, which then made them easy to handle. First, their hands were bound. Then, Garavito would remove all their clothes, and proceed to [[torture]], [[rape]], and sometimes [[decapitate]] them. Usually, the boy would endure prolonged rape and torture by having his buttocks stabbed and sharpened objects inserted into his anus; his testicles were often severed and placed into his mouth. The bodies of the children were all found completely naked, and all bore bite marks and signs of anal penetration; bottles of [[lubricant]] were found near the bodies, along with empty liquor bottles. Most [[corpse]]s showed signs of prolonged [[torture]].<ref>Benecke, pp.&nbsp;161\u2013162</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\nBeginning in 1992, boys between the ages of 6 through 16 began disappearing rapidly from the streets of [[Colombia]]. Due to the decades-long [[Colombian conflict|civil war]], many children in Colombia were poor, homeless, or orphaned. For years, these murders had gone unnoticed because many of the victims had no police report filed on their disappearance. Clusters of bodies had begun popping up all over Colombia, yet authorities did not take much notice until 1997, when [[mass grave]]s were uncovered.<ref name=BBC/>\n\nThis large number of missing children called for a widespread investigation, as these killings were not confined to a specific area. In February 1998, outside the town of [[G\u00e9nova, Quind\u00edo|G\u00e9nova]], Colombia, the bodies of two naked children were found lying next to each other on a hill. The next day, only meters away, another child's naked body was found. All three bodies had their hands bound and bore signs of sexual abuse. The victims' necks were severely cut, and bruises were on their backs, genitals, legs, and buttocks. The murder weapon was found in the same area as the bodies. A note that had been found at the crime scene had an address written on it; this information led them to Garavito's girlfriend.<ref name=Benecke2>{{cite web|title=Two homosexual pedophile sadistic serial killers|url=http://home.benecke.com/publications/2013/8/24/two-homosexual-pedophile-sadistic-serial-killers|website=Dr. Mark Benecke|language=de-DE|access-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045059/http://home.benecke.com/publications/2013/8/24/two-homosexual-pedophile-sadistic-serial-killers#|archive-date=4 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nShe was contacted but told police that she had not seen Garavito in months. She did, however, give to the police a bag that he had left in her possession, which contained a number of Garavito's belongings. These items included pictures of young boys, detailed journals of his murders, tally marks of his victims, and bills. This new information led them to Garavito's residence, but the property was vacant. Detectives believed that Garavito was either traveling for work or away attempting to find his next victim. He was picked up by the local police just a few days later, on an unrelated charge of attempted rape against an adolescent boy. A homeless man had been close enough to observe the struggle between Garavito and the child and felt it necessary to rescue the adolescent. Garavito was arrested and, unbeknownst to them, the police had in their custody the man who was the most wanted killer in Colombia.\n\n==Arrest, confession, and sentencing==\nGaravito was arrested on April 22, 1999, on separate charges of attempted rape.<ref name=Benecke2/> Garavito was questioned about the local killings and his attempted rape charges. Police speculated that Garavito had planned on killing the young boy if the bystander had not intervened. After a short interrogation, detectives suspected Garavito of being ''La Bestia'', although Garavito had insisted on his innocence. The detailed description of his killings brought Garavito to tears.<ref name=Discovery/>\n\nFor Colombia's Justice Department, Garavito's confession was not enough. Garavito had an eye condition that was rare and only found in men in a particular age group. His glasses were specifically designed for his unique condition. These particular glasses were found at the site of a mass grave. Garavito also left behind empty liquor bottles, his underwear, and occasionally his shoes. [[DNA]] was found on the victims, along with the other items left behind. Police scheduled the entire jail where Garavito was being detained to get an eye exam; the outcome of his eye exam would help police pair the glasses to Garavito. By making it mandatory for all the prisoners, it reduced Garavito's suspicion and kept him from lying about his eyesight.<ref name=Discovery/>\n\nWhile Garavito was out of his cell, detectives took DNA samples from his pillow and living area. The DNA found on the victims was a match to the DNA found in Garavito's cell. Garavito confessed to murdering 140 children and was charged with killing 172 altogether throughout Colombia.<ref>Benecke, p.&nbsp;162</ref> He was found guilty on 138 of the 172 accounts; the others are ongoing.

The judicial body ruled that all Garavito's sentences total 1,853 years and nine days in jail.\n\n==Early life==\nThough Garavito's mother is unknown, it had been speculated from the community of G\u00e9nova that Garavito's mother had been a long-time prostitute. During the time of working as a prostitute, Garavito's mother had been brutally abused by Garavito's father, who was a heavy alcoholic and would also abuse Garavito's siblings. Around this time, Garavito's father would force Garavito to watch his mother conduct in sexual intercourse with her clients, letting his mother's clients sexually abuse and molest Garavito. Under the influence of drugs, Garavito's mother would not do anything due to the abuse and torture of Garavito's alcoholic father. Garavito eventually ran away from home and survived on the Colombian streets. At the age of eight, Garavito was found by a paedophile. The man promised Garavito a hot meal and a place to rest; reluctantly, Garavito accepted the offer, but instead of the hot meal and a place to sleep, the man led Garavito to an abandoned house where Garavito was sexually assaulted. A few days after, Garavito then joined a rebellious gang for protection. The gang often robbed the Colombian civilians for food, money, and cars, which they exchanged for money at local chop shops.<ref>https://historycollection.co/luis-beast-garavito-worst-serial-killer-history/\n\n</ref>\n\nGaravito started working as soon as he \"earned\" enough money to survive on the streets,<ref>https://allthatsinteresting.com/luis-garavito\n\n</ref> travelling a substantial amount to keep up with the job demands in Colombia. Although he frequently moved, Garavito had a girlfriend named Teresa. His girlfriend had a small child which she recalls him getting along with very well. Garavito was known by his friends to be kind, yet easily angered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Victim type and killing patterns==\nGaravito's victims were clearly identified by their age, gender, and social status. Garavito targeted boys between the ages of 6 to 16 who were either homeless, peasants, or [[orphaned]]. He would approach the young boys, either on the crowded streets or alone in the countryside, and lure them away by [[bribing]] them with small gifts such as money, candy or [[Temporary work|odd jobs]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|title=World: Americas: Colombian child killer confesses|publisher=BBC Online Network|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/493887.stm|date=30 October 1999|accessdate=20 June 2010|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125035117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/493887.stm#|archive-date=25 January 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He offered easy work for money and even [[disguised]] himself as different characters who could be seen as legitimately offering work to the boy, such as a priest, a farmer, a homeless man, a street vendor, a drug dealer, an elderly man, and a [[gambler]].<ref name=Discovery>{{cite web|title=Serial Killer Documentary Luis Alfredo Garavito|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWw42vTHMdc|website=Discovery Channel|publisher=Discovery Channel|date=1 September 2016|access-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410172530/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWw42vTHMdc#|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> To prevent suspicions about his activities from developing, Garavito would change his disguise often.\n\nOnce he had the trust of a child, Garavito would walk with the boy until they were tired and vulnerable, which then made them easy to handle. First, their hands were bound. Then, Garavito would remove all their clothes, and proceed to [[torture]], [[rape]], and sometimes [[decapitate]] them. Usually, the boy would endure prolonged rape and torture by having his buttocks stabbed and sharpened objects inserted into his anus; his testicles were often severed and placed into his mouth. The bodies of the children were all found completely naked, and all bore bite marks and signs of anal penetration; bottles of [[lubricant]] were found near the bodies, along with empty liquor bottles. Most [[corpse]]s showed signs of prolonged [[torture]].<ref>Benecke, pp.&nbsp;161\u2013162</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\nBeginning in 1992, boys between the ages of 6 through 16 began disappearing rapidly from the streets of [[Colombia]]. Due to the decades-long [[Colombian conflict|civil war]], many children in Colombia were poor, homeless, or orphaned. For years, these murders had gone unnoticed because many of the victims had no police report filed on their disappearance. Clusters of bodies had begun popping up all over Colombia, yet authorities did not take much notice until 1997, when [[mass grave]]s were uncovered.<ref name=BBC/>\n\nThis large number of missing children called for a widespread investigation, as these killings were not confined to a specific area. In February 1998, outside the town of [[G\u00e9nova, Quind\u00edo|G\u00e9nova]], Colombia, the bodies of two naked children were found lying next to each other on a hill. The next day, only meters away, another child's naked body was found. All three bodies had their hands bound and bore signs of sexual abuse. The victims' necks were severely cut, and bruises were on their backs, genitals, legs, and buttocks. The murder weapon was found in the same area as the bodies. A note that had been found at the crime scene had an address written on it; this information led them to Garavito's girlfriend.<ref name=Benecke2>{{cite web|title=Two homosexual pedophile sadistic serial killers|url=http://home.benecke.com/publications/2013/8/24/two-homosexual-pedophile-sadistic-serial-killers|website=Dr. Mark Benecke|language=de-DE|access-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045059/http://home.benecke.com/publications/2013/8/24/two-homosexual-pedophile-sadistic-serial-killers#|archive-date=4 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nShe was contacted but told police that she had not seen Garavito in months. She did, however, give to the police a bag that he had left in her possession, which contained a number of Garavito's belongings. These items included pictures of young boys, detailed journals of his murders, tally marks of his victims, and bills. This new information led them to Garavito's residence, but the property was vacant. Detectives believed that Garavito was either traveling for work or away attempting to find his next victim. He was picked up by the local police just a few days later, on an unrelated charge of attempted rape against an adolescent boy. A homeless man had been close enough to observe the struggle between Garavito and the child and felt it necessary to rescue the adolescent. Garavito was arrested and, unbeknownst to them, the police had in their custody the man who was the most wanted killer in Colombia.\n\n==Arrest, confession, and sentencing==\nGaravito was arrested on April 22, 1999, on separate charges of attempted rape.<ref name=Benecke2/> Garavito was questioned about the local killings and his attempted rape charges. Police speculated that Garavito had planned on killing the young boy if the bystander had not intervened. After a short interrogation, detectives suspected Garavito of being ''La Bestia'', although Garavito had insisted on his innocence. The detailed description of his killings brought Garavito to tears.<ref name=Discovery/>\n\nFor Colombia's Justice Department, Garavito's confession was not enough. Garavito had an eye condition that was rare and only found in men in a particular age group. His glasses were specifically designed for his unique condition. These particular glasses were found at the site of a mass grave. Garavito also left behind empty liquor bottles, his underwear, and occasionally his shoes. [[DNA]] was found on the victims, along with the other items left behind. Police scheduled the entire jail where Garavito was being detained to get an eye exam; the outcome of his eye exam would help police pair the glasses to Garavito. By making it mandatory for all the prisoners, it reduced Garavito's suspicion and kept him from lying about his eyesight.<ref name=Discovery/>\n\nWhile Garavito was out of his cell, detectives took DNA samples from his pillow and living area. The DNA found on the victims was a match to the DNA found in Garavito's cell. Garavito confessed to murdering 140 children and was charged with killing 172 altogether throughout Colombia.<ref>Benecke, p.&nbsp;162</ref> He was found guilty on 138 of the 172 accounts; the others are ongoing.
