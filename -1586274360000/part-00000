The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an [[Imperial Free City]] and one of the first cities in Europe with an official [[Brewing right]] in 1293.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n[[File:Alte Markt Dortmund.JPG|thumb|Old market [[St. Reinoldi (Dortmund)|St. Reinolds]]]]\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of [[Cologne]] and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court ({{lang-de|Freistuhl}}) was in Dortmund, in a square between two [[linden tree]]s, one of which was known as the ''[[Gerichtslinde|Femelinde]]''. With the growing influence of [[Cologne]] during the 15th century, the seat was moved to [[Arnsberg]] in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the [[Anglo-Hanseatic War]] (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle.

[[William V, Prince of Orange|William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau]] did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince Willem Frederik]] (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the [[County of Dortmund]] then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the [[Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine|Rhine treaty]]. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite [[Ruhr (department)]].{{sfn|Britannica|1910}} At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The state mining authority of the [[Ruhr area]] was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Westphalia]], Dortmund was a district seat within [[Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg]] until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\n\nDuring the [[industrialisation]] of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for [[coal]] and [[steel]]. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the [[Kapp Putsch]] - a right military coup launched against the [[Social Democratic]]-led government. Radical workers formed a [[Ruhr Red Army|Red Army]] who fought the [[freikorps]] units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] was carried out by the invasion of [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1157/her_mit_der_kohle.html Her mit der Kohle \u2013 ''Der Spiegel'' EinesTages; retrieved on 4.

Dortmund{{sfn|Hennings|1990}} has since adapted, with its century-long steel and coal industries having been shifted to high-technology areas, including [[biomedical technology]], [[micro systems technology]], and [[Service (economics)|services]]. This has led Dortmund to become a regional centre for hi-tech industry.\n\nIn 2001 started a new era for the discrict [[H\u00f6rde]] in Dortmund, 160 years of industrial history ended with the beginning of the Phoenix See. The development of the Phoenix See area was carried out by a subsidiary of the Stadtwerke AG. In 2005 the first cornerstone was laid on the Phoenix area. The work started with full speed to manage the work with over 2.5 million meters of ground motion and 420.000 cubic meters of ferroconcrete. On 1 October 2010, the largest and most highly anticipated milestone could be celebrated: the launch of the flooding of the Phoenix See.

The city limits of Dortmund itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten ''kreisangeh\u00f6rig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4{{nbsp}}million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): [[Bochum]], [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Waltrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Kamen]], [[Unna]], [[Holzwickede]], [[Schwerte]], [[Hagen]], [[Herdecke]] and [[Witten]]. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of [[Westphalia]] which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of [[Westphalian Lowland]] and adjoins with the [[Ardey Hills]] in the south of the city to the [[Sauerland]].\n\nThe [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] forms the [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Hengsteysee]] next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of [[Hagen]] and [[Herdecke]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. The [[Klusenberg]], a hill that is part of the [[Ardey Hills|Ardey]] range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund {{cvt|254.3|m|||}}. There is also a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage plant]] on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at {{cvt|48.9|m|||}}.\n\nThe [[Emscher]] is a small river and has its wellspring in [[Holzwickede]], east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Essen]], [[Bottrop]], [[Oberhausen]] and [[Dinslaken]], where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n===Boroughs===\n[[File:Dortmund Bezirke und Nachbargemeinden.png|thumb|right|Municipalities and neighbouring communities]]\n[[File:Kreuzviertel_Althoffblock_alte_Hoeschzentrale_von_Florianturm.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of urban [[Kreuzviertel]]]]\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called '''''Stadtbezirke'''''), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area ([[Eving]], Scharnhorst, Brackel, [[Aplerbeck]], [[H\u00f6rde]], Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each ''''' Stadtbezirk''''' is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\n\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n*Stadtzentrum ''(City centre)''\n*Hafenviertel ''(Harbour Quarter)''\n*Nordmarkt\n*Borsigplatz\n*Kaiserviertel\n*Kronenviertel\n*Kreuzviertel\n*Klinikviertel ''(Clinical Quarter)''\n*Saarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\n*Unionviertel\n*Gartenstadt\n\n===Climate===\nDortmund is situated in the [[Temperateness|temperate climate zone]] with [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately {{convert|9|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season. Dortmund features characteristics of densely populated areas as for example the occurrence of [[urban heat islands]] is typical. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Geografie & Klima - Stadtportr\u00e4t - Leben in Dortmund - Stadtportal dortmund.de|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115215001/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/geografie_und_klima/index.html|accessdate=2020-03-19|date=2013-01-15|work=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box |metric first= Yes |single line= Yes |location= Dortmund \n|Jan record high C=14.6\n|Feb record high C=18.5\n|Mar record high C=23.5\n|Apr record high C=30.2\n|May record high C=34.4\n|Jun record high C=34.9\n|Jul record high C=36.8\n|Aug record high C=37.6\n|Sep record high C=33.4\n|Oct record high C=28.6\n|Nov record high C=20.1\n|Dec record high C=16.1\n|year record high C=37.6\n|Jan high C= 4\n|Feb high C= 5\n|Mar high C= 9\n|Apr high C= 13\n|May high C= 18\n|Jun high C= 21\n|Jul high C= 22\n|Aug high C= 22\n|Sep high C= 19\n|Oct high C= 15\n|Nov high C= 9\n|Dec high C= 5\n|Jan low C= \u22121\n|Feb low C= \u22121\n|Mar low C= 2\n|Apr low C= 4\n|May low C= 8\n|Jun low C= 11\n|Jul low C= 13\n|Aug low C= 13\n|Sep low C= 10\n|Oct low C= 7\n|Nov low C= 3\n|Dec low C= 1\n|rain colour= green\n|Jan rain mm= 65\n|Feb rain mm= 56\n|Mar rain mm= 53\n|Apr rain mm= 57\n|May rain mm= 68\n|Jun rain mm= 78\n|Jul rain mm= 93\n|Aug rain mm= 93\n|Sep rain mm= 67\n|Oct rain mm= 60\n|Nov rain mm= 71\n|Dec rain mm= 77\n|Jan rain days= 19\n|Feb rain days= 17\n|Mar rain days= 14\n|Apr rain days= 16\n|May rain days= 14\n|Jun rain days= 14\n|Jul rain days= 17\n|Aug rain days= 16\n|Sep rain days= 15\n|Oct rain days= 17\n|Nov rain days= 19\n|Dec rain days= 19\n|source 1= Wetter Kontor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetterkontor.de/de/klima/klima2.asp?land=de&stat=10416 |title=Klima Deutschland, Dortmund - Klimadiagramm, Klimatabelle - WetterKontor |publisher=Wetterkontor.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+ '''Largest groups of foreign residents'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2017|url=https://www.dortmund.de/media/p/statistik_3/statistik/bevoelkerung/02_03_Bevoelkerung_Geschlecht_Ausgewaehlte_Staatsangehoerigkeiten.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115201620/https://www.dortmund.de/media/p/statistik_3/statistik/bevoelkerung/02_03_Bevoelkerung_Geschlecht_Ausgewaehlte_Staatsangehoerigkeiten.pdf|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n!Nationality !!

During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called [[Ruhr]] attracted up to 500,000 ethnic [[Poles]], [[Mazurs|Masurians]] and [[Silesians]] from [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] in a migration known as ''[[Ostflucht]]'' (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from [[France]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is [[List of cities in Germany by population|the eighth largest city in Germany]] after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. It is also the largest city in the [[Ruhr]] agglomeration.\n\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities.<ref name=\"dortmund.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |title=Dortmund 2012: Mehr Einwohner, mehr Studierende, mehr \u00dcbernachtungen - Nachrichtenportal - Leben in Dortmund - Stadtportal |publisher=Dortmund.de |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211183302/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |archivedate=11 February 2013 }}</ref> Data of the [[2011 EU census|EU-wide 2011 census]] revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures.

Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (''Bezirk'') has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\n\nDortmund is often called the ''Herzkammer der SPD'' (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was [[Fritz Hen\u00dfler]]. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): [[Ullrich Sierau]] (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\n\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014.

The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War&nbsp;II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the [[Hellweg|Westen-/Ostenhellweg]], part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\n\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/stadtgeschichte/20jahrhundert/wiederaufbau/|title=Wiederaufbau - 20.

Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the [[second World War]], relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, [[Kreuzviertel]] forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life.

All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtbezirke/stbzportal_innenstadtnord/leben_in_in//|title=Die Stadt im Wiederaufbau|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\n\nThe area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html// |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330025233/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html |archivedate=30 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the [[Expo 2000]] in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein [[Borussia Dortmund]] was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvb.de/eng/BVB/History/1909//|title=BVB 09 - Back to our History - 1909 - Borussia Dortmund - bvb.de|website=www.bvb.de}}</ref>\n\n====Kaiserviertel====\n[[File:Dortmund Kaiserstra\u00dfenviertel.jpg|thumb|Cherry Blossom Avenue]]\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\n\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n====Unionviertel====\n[[File:Unionviertel Dortmund.jpg|thumb|Rheinische Stra\u00dfe]]\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-c-c-e.de/kreativquartiere-ruhr.html|title=ecce - european centre for creative economy: Kreativ.Quartiere Ruhr|website=www.e-c-c-e.de}}</ref>\n\n====H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix====\n[[File:Phoenixsee Dortmund, Deutschland.jpg|thumb|Lake Phoenix]]\n[[File:Dortmund Hoerde Hoerder Burg 05.jpg|thumb|H\u00f6rde castle]]\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of [[Herdecke]], [[Witten]], [[Bochum]], [[Castrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Unna]] und [[Schwerte]]. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the [[Emscher]] and Lake Phoenix.\n\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in [[Europe]]. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of [[ThyssenKrupp]] newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund.

The water surface area of 24 acres is larger than the [[Hamburg]] [[Alster]]. Lake Phoenix is a shallow water lake with a depth of 3 to 4 meters and a capacity of around 600,000 cubic meters. Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\n\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\n*[[Zalando]]\n*[[HSBC Trinkaus]]\n*[[German Handball Association]]\n*[[Handball-Bundesliga|Handball-Bundesliga (HBL)]]\n*[[German public bank|Academy of the German public Bank]]\n*[[Mircosonic]]\n\nThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/en/leisure_and_culture/phoenix_see_1/index.html|title=Phoenix-See - Leisure & Culture - dortmund.de|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\nThe River [[Emscher]] flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake. Together with the renatured Emscher, the Lake forms a water landscape of 33 hectares, which, as a linking area, is an important element of the Emscher landscape park. The renaturation of the Emscher River is managed by the public [[water board]] [[Emschergenossenschaft]]. The financial frame is 4.5 billion Euro and the aim is to finish the main work by the year 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/umweltschutz-umweltwirtschaft/umwelt-und-wasser/abwasser/emscherumbau/|title=webpage Environment Ministry|access-date=14 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223023515/https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/umweltschutz-umweltwirtschaft/umwelt-und-wasser/abwasser/emscherumbau/|archive-date=23 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nMarktplatz Hoerde.jpg|Oldtown H\u00f6rde\nDortmund - PO-Phoenix-See + H\u00f6rde 01 ies.jpg|Lake Phoenix\nDortmund - PO-Hafenpromenade+Hafen 01 ies.jpg|Port Promenade\nDortmund - PO-Phoenix-See + Kaiserberg (Kulturinsel) 01 ies.jpg|Kaiser Hill\n</gallery>\n\n===Churches===\n[[File:Marienkirchhof Dortmund.jpg|thumb|Reinoldikirche and Marienkirche]]\n* [[Reinoldikirche]], a Protestant church (built in 1233\u20131450)\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Petrikirche, Dortmund|de|3=Petrikirche (Dortmund)|lt=Petrikirche}}, a now Protestant church (start of construction 1322).

The [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the [[Ruhr Area]]. It crosses the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-German border as a continuation of the Dutch [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] and crosses the [[Rhine]], leads through the [[Ruhr valley]] toward [[Bochum]], becoming B&nbsp;1 ([[Bundesstra\u00dfe 1|Bundesstra\u00dfe&nbsp;1]]) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A&nbsp;44 near [[Holzwickede]]. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to ''Der Spiegel'', it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\n\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]] and [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]], which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the [[Kamener Kreuz]] interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]] to the west these form the [[Dortmund Beltway]] (''Dortmunder Autobahnring'').\n\n===Cycling===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a [[Bike freeway]] called the ''Radschnellweg Ruhr'' (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n===Rail transport===\n[[File:HBFDo.JPG|thumb|Dortmund central railway station]]\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\n\nThe central train station ([[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Dortmund with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Berlin]] and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive [[Dortmund Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] and bus system. The U-Bahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of [[L\u00fcnen]] in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last [[tram]]s on the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|title=Neuer U-Bahn-Tunnel: keine Stra\u00dfenbahn mehr in Dortmunder City|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Oliver Volmerich|date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914092307/http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|archive-date=14 September 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system.

The ruins of the later Hohensyburg castle now stand on the site of the Sigiburg. The hillfort was raised ca. 700 by [[Westphalia]]n Saxons. During the [[Saxon Wars]], it was taken by the [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]] in 772, retaken by the Saxons (possibly under [[Widukind]]) in 774, and taken again and refortified by Charlemagne in 775.

The combination of crossroad, market place, administrative centre \u2013 town hall, made Dortmund an important centre in Westphalia. \nIt became an [[Imperial Free City]] and one of the first cities in Europe with an official [[Brewing right]] in 1293.{{sfn|Ring|1995}} Throughout the 13th to 14th centuries, it was the \"chief city\" of the Rhine, Westphalia, the Netherlands Circle of the [[Hanseatic League]].\n[[File:Alte Markt Dortmund.JPG|thumb|Old market [[St. Reinoldi (Dortmund)|St. Reinolds]]]]\nAfter 1320, the city appeared in writing as \"Dorpmunde\". In the years leading up to 1344, the English King even borrowed money from well-heeled Dortmund merchant families Berswordt and Klepping, offering the regal crown as security. In 1388, Count von Mark joined forces with the Archbishop of [[Cologne]] and issued declarations of a feud against the town. Following a major siege lasting 18 months, peace negotiations took place and Dortmund emerged victorious. In 1400 the seat of the first Vehmic court ({{lang-de|Freistuhl}}) was in Dortmund, in a square between two [[linden tree]]s, one of which was known as the ''[[Gerichtslinde|Femelinde]]''. With the growing influence of [[Cologne]] during the 15th century, the seat was moved to [[Arnsberg]] in 1437. After Cologne was excluded after the [[Anglo-Hanseatic War]] (1470\u201374), Dortmund was made capital of the Rhine-Westphalian and Netherlands Circle.

[[William V, Prince of Orange|William V, Prince of Orange-Nassau]] did not want stolen areas and therefore let his son [[William I of the Netherlands|Prince Willem Frederik]] (the later King William I of the Netherlands) take possession of the city and the principality. This prince held its entry on 30 June 1806, and as such the [[County of Dortmund]] then became part of the principality. On 12 July 1806, most of the Nassau principalities were deprived of their sovereign rights by means of the [[Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine|Rhine treaty]]. In October of the same year, the County of Dortmund was occupied by French troops and was added to the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] on 1 March 1808. It is the capital of the Ruhr department. In 1808 Dortmund becomes capital of French satellite [[Ruhr (department)]].{{sfn|Britannica|1910}} At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the entire Grand Duchy of Berg, including Dortmund, was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The state mining authority of the [[Ruhr area]] was founded in 1815 and moved from Bochum to Dortmund. Within the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Westphalia]], Dortmund was a district seat within [[Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg]] until 1875, when it became an urban district within the region.\n\nDuring the [[industrialisation]] of Prussia, Dortmund became a major centre for [[coal]] and [[steel]]. The town expanded into a city, with the population rising from 57,742 in 1875 to 379,950 in 1905. Sprawling residential areas like the North, East, Union and Kreuz district sprang up in less than 10 years. In 1920, Dortmund was one of the centres for resistance to the [[Kapp Putsch]] - a right military coup launched against the [[Social Democratic]]-led government. Radical workers formed a [[Ruhr Red Army|Red Army]] who fought the [[freikorps]] units involved in the coup. On 11 January 1923, the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] was carried out by the invasion of [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On the morning of 31 March 1923, it came to the sad culmination of this French-German confrontation.<ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1157/her_mit_der_kohle.html Her mit der Kohle \u2013 ''Der Spiegel'' EinesTages; retrieved on 4.

The city limits of Dortmund itself are {{convert|87|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and border twelve cities, two independent and ten ''kreisangeh\u00f6rig'' (i.e., belonging to a district), with a total population of approximately 2.4{{nbsp}}million. The following cities border Dortmund (clockwise starting from north-east): [[Bochum]], [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Waltrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Kamen]], [[Unna]], [[Holzwickede]], [[Schwerte]], [[Hagen]], [[Herdecke]] and [[Witten]]. Historically speaking, Dortmund is a part of [[Westphalia]] which is situated in the Bundesland North Rhine-Westphalia. Moreover, Dortmund is part of [[Westphalian Lowland]] and adjoins with the [[Ardey Hills]] in the south of the city to the [[Sauerland]].\n\nThe [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] forms the [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Hengsteysee]] next to the borough of Syburg in the south of Dortmund between the cities of [[Hagen]] and [[Herdecke]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. The [[Klusenberg]], a hill that is part of the [[Ardey Hills|Ardey]] range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee and the highest point of Dortmund {{cvt|254.3|m|||}}. There is also a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage plant]] on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk. The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Brechten at {{cvt|48.9|m|||}}.\n\nThe [[Emscher]] is a small river and has its wellspring in [[Holzwickede]], east of the city of Dortmund, and flows west through Dortmund. Towns along the Emscher take in Dortmund, [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Essen]], [[Bottrop]], [[Oberhausen]] and [[Dinslaken]], where it flows into the Rhine.\n\n===Boroughs===\n[[File:Dortmund Bezirke und Nachbargemeinden.png|thumb|right|Municipalities and neighbouring communities]]\n[[File:Kreuzviertel_Althoffblock_alte_Hoeschzentrale_von_Florianturm.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of urban [[Kreuzviertel]]]]\nDortmund comprises 62 neighbourhoods which in turn are grouped into twelve boroughs (called '''''Stadtbezirke'''''), often named after the most important neighbourhood. Three boroughs cover the area of the inner city (Innenstadt-West (City centre West), Innenstadt-Nord (City centre North), Innenstadt-Ost (City centre East)) and the remaining nine boroughs make up the surrounding area ([[Eving]], Scharnhorst, Brackel, [[Aplerbeck]], [[H\u00f6rde]], Hombruch, L\u00fctgendortmund, Huckarde, Mengede). Each ''''' Stadtbezirk''''' is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local governing body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1905 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with \"their\" boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: The borough of H\u00f6rde, located in the south of Dortmund and independent until 1928, has its own coat of arms.\n\nThe centre can be subdivided into historically evolved city districts whose borders are not always strictly defined, such as\n*Stadtzentrum ''(City centre)''\n*Hafenviertel ''(Harbour Quarter)''\n*Nordmarkt\n*Borsigplatz\n*Kaiserviertel\n*Kronenviertel\n*Kreuzviertel\n*Klinikviertel ''(Clinical Quarter)''\n*Saarlandstra\u00dfenviertel\n*Unionviertel\n*Gartenstadt\n\n===Climate===\nDortmund is situated in the [[Temperateness|temperate climate zone]] with [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''). Winters are cool; summers are warm. The average annual temperature lies at approximately {{convert|9|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, the total average annual amount of precipitation lies at approximately {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation evenly falls throughout the year; steady rain (with some snow), prevails in the wintertime, isolated showers dominate the summer season.

During the 19th century the area around Dortmund called [[Ruhr]] attracted up to 500,000 ethnic [[Poles]], [[Mazurs|Masurians]] and [[Silesians]] from [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] in a migration known as ''[[Ostflucht]]'' (flight from the east). Most of the new inhabitants came from Eastern Europe, but immigrants also came from [[France]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Almost all their descendants today speak German as a mother tongue, and for various reasons they do not identify with their Polish roots and traditions, often only their Polish family names remaining as a sign of their past. Not taking the fluctuation of war years into account, the population figures rose constantly to 657,804 in 1965. As a result of the city's post-industrial decline, the population fell to just under 580,000 in 2011. Today with a population of 601.402 (2017) the City of Dortmund is [[List of cities in Germany by population|the eighth largest city in Germany]] after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. It is also the largest city in the [[Ruhr]] agglomeration.\n\nContrary to earlier projections, population figures have been on the rise in recent years due to net migration gains. Dortmund has seen a moderate influx of younger people (18 to 25 years of age) mainly because of its universities.<ref name=\"dortmund.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |title=Dortmund 2012: Mehr Einwohner, mehr Studierende, mehr \u00dcbernachtungen - Nachrichtenportal - Leben in Dortmund - Stadtportal |publisher=Dortmund.de |date=31 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211183302/http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/nachrichtenportal/nachricht.jsp?nid=230976 |archivedate=11 February 2013 }}</ref> Data of the [[2011 EU census|EU-wide 2011 census]] revealed massive inaccuracies with regard to German population figures.

Since 1975, Dortmund is divided into twelve administrative districts. Each district (''Bezirk'') has its own elected district council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The district councils are advisory only.\n\nDortmund is often called the ''Herzkammer der SPD'' (roughly translated as \"heartland of the Social democrats\"), which is the politically dominant party in the city. During the Nazi era (1933\u20131945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modeled on that of British cities. The first major elected by the population of Dortmund was [[Fritz Hen\u00dfler]]. Since the end of the war, the SPD has held a relative majority in the town council - except from 1999 to 2004. Since the 2012 local election, there have been 8 parties and electors' groups in the town council (86 seats; 2009: 96 seats): [[Ullrich Sierau]] (SPD) has been the mayor of Dortmund since May 2010. He has had to work with changing majorities in the local council.\n\nThe last municipal election was held on 25 May 2014. The SPD reached 38.2% (36 seats), CDU 27.2% (26 seats), die Gr\u00fcnen 15.4% (15 seats), Die Linke 6.8% (6 seats), the AfD 3.4% (3 seats), the FDP 2.4% (2 seats), Piraten 2.3% (2 seats), Die Rechte 1.0% (1 seat), the B\u00fcrgerliste f\u00fcr Dortmund 1.0% (1 seat), the NPD 0.9% (1 seat) und the Freie B\u00fcrger-Initiative 0.7% (1 seats).\n\n===International relations===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nDortmund is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Dortmunder St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/internationales/staedtepartnerschaften/start_sp_1/index.html|website=dortmund.de|publisher=Dortmund|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|GBR}} [[Leeds]], United Kingdom, since 1949\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Amiens]], France, since 1960\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia, since 1973\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], United States, since 1977\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Netanya]], Israel, since 1980\n*{{flagicon|SRB}} [[Novi Sad]], Serbia, since 1981\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Zwickau]], Germany, since 1989\n*{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Xi\u2019an]], China, since 1991\n*{{flagicon|TUR}} [[Trabzon]], Turkey, since 2014\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Dortmund Panorama.jpg|thumb|Dortmund with RWE-Tower and churches of Reinoldi, Petri and Marien on the right]]\nDortmund's city centre offers a picture full of contrasts. Historic buildings like [[Altes Stadthaus, Dortmund|Altes Stadthaus]] or the Kr\u00fcgerpassage rub shoulders with post-war architecture like Gesundheitshaus and concrete constructions with Romanesque churches like the [[Reinoldikirche]] and the [[Marienkirche, Dortmund|Marienkirche]]. The near-complete destruction of Dortmund's city centre during World War&nbsp;II (98%) has resulted in a varied architectural landscape. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. The downtown of Dortmund still retains the outline of the medieval city. A ring road marks the former city wall, and the [[Hellweg|Westen-/Ostenhellweg]], part of a medieval salt trading route, is still the major (pedestrian) street bisecting the city centre.\n\nThus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtportraet/stadtgeschichte/20jahrhundert/wiederaufbau/|title=Wiederaufbau - 20.

Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts still standing being from 1896. In the [[second World War]], relatively few buildings were destroyed in comparison to other areas of the city. Today, [[Kreuzviertel]] forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 100 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the Kreuzkirche at Kreuzstra\u00dfe and the first Concrete Church in Germany St.-Nicolai. Nowadays the Kreuzviertel is a trendy district with pubs, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries and little shops. Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighbourhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. The West park is the green lung of the Kreuzviertel and in the months between May and October a centre of the student urban life. The district has the highest real estate prices in Dortmund.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.capital.de/immobilien-kompass/dortmund.html/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228181111/https://www.capital.de/immobilien-kompass/dortmund.html#Szeneviertel |archive-date=28 December 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEven today many artists choose Kreuzviertel as their residence: [[Sascha Schmitz]], [[Christina Hammer]] and players of [[Borussia Dortmund]].\n\n==== Nordstadt ====\n\n[[File:Nordstadt_Dortmund_Hafenviertel.jpg|thumb|Dockland - young restaurant and bars scene]]\nThe northern downtown part of Dortmund called Nordstadt, situated in a territory of 14.42&nbsp;km\u00b2 is shaped by a colorful variety of cultures. As the largest homogeneous old building area in [[Ruhr]] the Nordstadt is a melting pot of different people of different countries and habits just a few steps from the city center. The Nordstadt is an industrial [[urban area]] that was mainly developed in the 19th Century to serve the [[Westfalenh\u00fctte]] steelworks, port and rail freight depot. All of the residents live in a densely populated 300 hectare area (the most densely populated residential area in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] with steelworks, port and railway lines acting as physical barriers cutting off the area from the city centre and other residential districts).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dortmund.de/de/leben_in_dortmund/stadtbezirke/stbzportal_innenstadtnord/leben_in_in//|title=Die Stadt im Wiederaufbau|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\n\nThe area has been badly affected by the deindustrialisation of these heavy industries, with the target area developing a role as the home for growing numbers of immigrants and socially disadvantaged groups partly because of the availability of cheaper (although poor quality) accommodation. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html// |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330025233/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/dortmund-boosts-efforts-to-integrate-bulgarian-and-romanian-immigrants-a-911619.html |archivedate=30 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, two parks \u2013 Fredenbaumpark and Hoeschpark \u2013 are situated there. There is also much equipment for children to spend their free time. For example, the 35 meters high Big Tipi, which was brought in from the [[Expo 2000]] in Hanover. All of that should attract families to settle in, but low prices of apartments and a variety of renting offers speak for the contrary. This developed into the youngest population of Dortmund is living and created a district with art house cinemas to ethnic stores, from exotic restaurants to student pubs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Borsigplatz is probably one of the best known squares in the Nordstadt. Ballspielverein [[Borussia Dortmund]] was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station. The streets radiating outward to form a star shape, the sycamore in the middle of the square and the tramline running diagonally across the square give Borsigplatz its very own flair.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvb.de/eng/BVB/History/1909//|title=BVB 09 - Back to our History - 1909 - Borussia Dortmund - bvb.de|website=www.bvb.de}}</ref>\n\n====Kaiserviertel====\n[[File:Dortmund Kaiserstra\u00dfenviertel.jpg|thumb|Cherry Blossom Avenue]]\nThe Kaiserstra\u00dfen District is located east of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. In this district numerous magnificent buildings from the 1900s and new buildings from the 1950s are located next to the heritage-protected State Mining Office Dortmund, several Courts, Consulate and the East Cemetery. The district is characterize by the employee of the Amtsgericht, Landgericht (the first and second instances of ordinary jurisdiction) and the Prison.\n\nToday the historical Kaiserbrunnen and the entrance sign for Kaiserstra\u00dfe are important starting points for a tour to the popular shopping district. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Avenue, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstra\u00dfen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists.\n\n====Unionviertel====\n[[File:Unionviertel Dortmund.jpg|thumb|Rheinische Stra\u00dfe]]\nThe Union District is located west of the former ramparts of Dortmund and follows the course of the [[Westenhellweg]]. For a long time, the neighbourhood at the Dortmunder U and along the Rheinische Stra\u00dfe was marked by vacancy and social distortion due to structural change. Today it is developing an inspiring young artist scene, with more and more students thanks to cheaper apartments near the university and a vibrant gastronomy. This development benefits strongly from the new, widely visible beacon, the art and creative centre Dortmunder U, opened in 2010. Yet, for a time, it was mainly the Union Gewerbehof activists and other single stakeholders who initiated change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-c-c-e.de/kreativquartiere-ruhr.html|title=ecce - european centre for creative economy: Kreativ.Quartiere Ruhr|website=www.e-c-c-e.de}}</ref>\n\n====H\u00f6rde on Lake Phoenix====\n[[File:Phoenixsee Dortmund, Deutschland.jpg|thumb|Lake Phoenix]]\n[[File:Dortmund Hoerde Hoerder Burg 05.jpg|thumb|H\u00f6rde castle]]\nH\u00f6rde is borough in the south of the city of Dortmund. Originally H\u00f6rde was a separate town (until 1929) and was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. In 1388, the \"Gro\u00dfen Dortmunder Fehde\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H\u00f6rde and its allies of [[Herdecke]], [[Witten]], [[Bochum]], [[Castrop]], [[L\u00fcnen]], [[Unna]] und [[Schwerte]]. Today H\u00f6rde is a part of Dortmund with restored old buildings combined with modern architecture. The H\u00f6rder Burg (H\u00f6rde castle) was built in the 12th century and is located in the east of the town, close to the [[Emscher]] and Lake Phoenix.\n\nLake Phoenix was one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in [[Europe]]. On the area of the former blast furnace and steel plant site of [[ThyssenKrupp]] newly formed and developed a new urban resident and recreational area 3 kilometers (2.6 miles) from the city centre of Dortmund.

Attractive high priced residential areas were thus created on the southern and northern sides of the Lake. On the western lakeside, the existing district centre of H\u00f6rde is enlarged by a city port and a mixed functional urban area.\n\nCompanies with agencies and offices on the lakefront include:\n\n*[[Zalando]]\n*[[HSBC Trinkaus]]\n*[[German Handball Association]]\n*[[Handball-Bundesliga|Handball-Bundesliga (HBL)]]\n*[[German public bank|Academy of the German public Bank]]\n*[[Mircosonic]]\n\nThe finished sole is primarily fed by groundwater and unpolluted rainwater from the new building sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dortmund.de/en/leisure_and_culture/phoenix_see_1/index.html|title=Phoenix-See - Leisure & Culture - dortmund.de|website=www.dortmund.de}}</ref>\nThe River [[Emscher]] flows through an embanked riverbed without direct link to the Lake.

The [[Bundesautobahn 40|Ruhrschnellweg]] follows old Hanseatic trade routes to connect the city with the other metropolises of the [[Ruhr Area]]. It crosses the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-German border as a continuation of the Dutch [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] and crosses the [[Rhine]], leads through the [[Ruhr valley]] toward [[Bochum]], becoming B&nbsp;1 ([[Bundesstra\u00dfe 1|Bundesstra\u00dfe&nbsp;1]]) at the Kreuz Dortmund West and eventually merging into the A&nbsp;44 near [[Holzwickede]]. It has officially been named Ruhrschnellweg (Ruhr Fast Way), but locals usually call it Ruhrschleichweg (Ruhr Crawling Way) or \"the Ruhr area's longest parking lot\". According to ''Der Spiegel'', it is the most congested motorway in Germany.\n\nConnections to more distant parts of Germany are maintained by Autobahn routes [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]] and [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]], which traverse the north and east city limits and meet at the [[Kamener Kreuz]] interchange north-east of Dortmund.\nIn combination with the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]] to the west these form the [[Dortmund Beltway]] (''Dortmunder Autobahnring'').\n\n===Cycling===\nCycling in Dortmund is supported by urban planners - an extensive network of cycle paths exists which had its beginnings in the 1980s.  Dortmund was admitted to the German \"Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle-Friendly Cities and Municipalities in NRW\" (AGFS) on August 8, 2007. Dortumund is connected to a number of long-distance cycle paths and a [[Bike freeway]] called the ''Radschnellweg Ruhr'' (Ruhr Area Fast Cycle Path).\n\n===Rail transport===\n[[File:HBFDo.JPG|thumb|Dortmund central railway station]]\nAs with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the [[DB Regio]] subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21), is a member of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr]] (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB's [[railway line]]s (except the high-speed [[InterCity]] and [[Intercity-Express]] networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of DSW21, all other members of VRR, and DB.\n\nThe central train station ([[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]) is the third largest long distance traffic junction in Germany. Dortmund has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Dortmund Main Station). ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Dortmund with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 2h 30) and Paris (in 3h 50). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Berlin]] and other cities in the Rhein-Ruhr Region.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nFor public transportation, the city has an extensive [[Dortmund Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] and bus system. The U-Bahn has eight lines (U41 to U49) serving Dortmund and the large suburb of [[L\u00fcnen]] in the north. The trains that run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 5 to 10 minute intervals. In April 2008, the newly constructed east\u2013west underground light rail line was opened, completing the underground service in the city centre and replacing the last [[tram]]s on the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|title=Neuer U-Bahn-Tunnel: keine Stra\u00dfenbahn mehr in Dortmunder City|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Oliver Volmerich|date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914092307/http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/nrw/art1544,243917|archive-date=14 September 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA number of bus lines complete the Dortmund public transport system.

Nanobiotix would build on his work to develop what is now known as NBTXR3, a first-in-class \u201cradioenhancer\u201d designed to significantly increase the efficacy of [[radiation therapy]] without increasing negative [[side effects]] associated with [[radiation]]. In 2011, Nanobiotix treated its first patient using NBTXR3.  In 2018 the results of a phase III clinical trial established that this new type of product could work in humans. In 2019 the company received approval to sell NBTXR3 in Europe under the brand name Hensify\u00ae for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities and trunk wall.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bonvalot | first=Sylvie | last2=Rutkowski | first2=Piotr L | last3=Thariat | first3=Juliette | last4=Carr\u00e8re | first4=S\u00e9bastien | last5=Ducassou | first5=Anne | last6=Sunyach | first6=Marie-Pierre | last7=Agoston | first7=Peter | last8=Hong | first8=Angela | last9=Mervoyer | first9=Augustin | last10=Rastrelli | first10=Marco | last11=Moreno | first11=Victor | last12=Li | first12=Rubi K | last13=Tiangco | first13=B\u00e9atrice | last14=Herraez | first14=Antonio Casado | last15=Gronchi | first15=Alessandro | last16=Mangel | first16=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 | last17=Sy-Ortin | first17=Teresa | last18=Hohenberger | first18=Peter | last19=Ba\u00e8re | first19=Thierry de | last20=Cesne | first20=Axel Le | last21=Helfre | first21=Sylvie | last22=Saada-Bouzid | first22=Esma | last23=Borkowska | first23=Aneta | last24=Anghel | first24=Rodica | last25=Co | first25=Ann | last26=Gebhart | first26=Michael | last27=Kantor | first27=Guy | last28=Montero | first28=Angel | last29=Loong | first29=Herbert H | last30=Verg\u00e9s | first30=Ramona | last31=Lapeire | first31=Lore | last32=Dema | first32=Sorin | last33=Kacso | first33=Gabriel | last34=Austen | first34=Lyn | last35=Moureau-Zabotto | first35=Laurence | last36=Servois | first36=Vincent | last37=Wardelmann | first37=Eva | last38=Terrier | first38=Philippe | last39=Lazar | first39=Alexander J | last40=Bov\u00e9e | first40=Judith V M G | last41=P\u00e9choux | first41=C\u00e9cile Le | last42=Papai | first42=Zsusanna | title=NBTXR3, a first-in-class radioenhancer hafnium oxide nanoparticle, plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced soft-tissue sarcoma (Act.In.Sarc): a multicentre, phase 2\u20133, randomised, controlled trial | journal=The Lancet Oncology | volume=20 | issue=8 | date=2019-08-01 | issn=1470-2045 | pmid=31296491 | doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30326-2 | pages=1148\u20131159 | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30326-2/abstract | ref=harv | access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Swift | first=Diana | title=Novel Radioenhancer Boosts RT Response in Sarcoma | website=MedPage Today | date=2019-07-16 | url=https://www.medpagetoday.com/hematologyoncology/othercancers/81034 | ref=harv | access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= pubmeddev | last2=S | first2=Bonvalot | last3=Al. | first3=Et | title=PubMed | website=NCBI | date=2016-12-22 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27998887 | ref=harv | access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Cynthia E.

It received moderate reviews from critics, and failed to recoup its {{INRConvert|600|m}} investment, grossing {{INRConvert|400|m}}.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present day, 2017,Gaurav Kapoor ([[Sidharth Malhotra]]), based in suburban [[Miami]], plans to marry his colleague Kavya ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), who happens to be the woman of his dreams, but she prefers a man who is more adventurous and risk-loving.\n\nRunning parallel to his story , is the story of clandestine spy Rishi Purohit ([[Sidharth Malhotra]]), who is seen to have been trying to extract some crucial substance from the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok. However, when a co-spy, Yakub ([[Darshan Kumaar]]), shoots down an innocent civilian, the dishonest move enrages Rishi. Nonetheless, he returns to Mumbai, where it is revealed that he works for Unit X, a spy organisation headed by Colonel Vijay Saxena ([[Suniel Shetty]]). Rishi explains to Col. Vijay that he can't continue with such routines, and that he wants to start life afresh. Col. Vijay asks him to perform one last job for him, and this involves spying on a minister who Col. Vijay claims to be corrupt and wants to blackmail, and copying data from his cellphone into a hard drive which is wanted by Col. Vijay. Rishi does save contents into the hard drive, but Col. Vijay, having decided that Rishi is useless, instructs Yakub through a text message to kill him. Rishi senses the suspicion, and fights off Yakub and the other spies. Yakub manages to shoot Rishi, destroying the hard drive, but Rishi escapes.\n\nGaurav tries to hang out with Kavya on a date, and also meets her parents, who consider getting him married to Kavya. Meanwhile, he is ordered by his boss to visit Mumbai to close a business deal. Rewinding to Rishi's life, he is shown meeting a man named Gaurav Kapoor, who works in a cyber firm in Mumbai, and has important data about the minister's connections. When Gaurav is murdered by Yakub on account of being a liability, Rishi decides to adopt Gaurav's identity to successfully escape from Yakub after his last mission. This leads to his present-day life in 2017 as Gaurav in a Miami software company meaning Gaurav and Rishi are the same person and the events leading up to his new life took place five years earlier in 2012.\n\nAfter being unintentionally recorded in a viral video and recognised by the members of Unit X, Gaurav is soon attacked by Koko, an associate of Unit X's local contact Jignesh. He is forced to abduct and hide Koko in his car, which is noticed by his friend Dixit ([[Hussain Dalal]]), who tries to help him and unintentionally kills Koko in the struggle. Yakub and other Unit X agents track Gaurav down, and confront him, where he finally confesses, as Rishi, that he needed a life. He is knocked down unconscious, and soon finds himself handcuffed with Kavya who had stopped by his house. Gaurav uses his skills to escape with Kavya from the trouble, and ends up confessing to her that he is a retired covert operations specialist. Kavya berates him, but takes pity on him when she notices his bloody stab wound. The two make love. Later that night, the two find themselves under fire after Unit X agents, headed by Yakub, raid the motel they are hiding in. Rishi hatches a quick scheme to retrieve the data, since the hard drive is damaged, and convinces Yakub to work with him on their final mission.\n\nRishi executes the heist with success, but security guards take notice and begin chasing Rishi. Yakub aborts the operation and abandons him. They meet at Rishi's house, where Rishi kills most of Yakub's henchmen with the help of Kavya. However, Rishi spares Yakub and two of his thugs and orders him to leave his house. Driving away in Rishi's car, Yakub realises that the hard drive Rishi gave is blank, and the car's trunk contains Koko's corpse. Dixit, working with Rishi, crashes into their car in a [[side collision]], and police arriving on the scene discover the body. Yakub and his thugs are killed by the cops as they open fire. Col. Vijay visits Rishi's house to confront him, but is killed in an explosion planned by Rishi. This neutralises Unit X, and Rishi and Kavya soon leave the city with new identities of Hemant and Pooja Khanna.\n\nA mid-credits scene shows Dixit buying machine guns from a local gun store in Miami before putting on a [[hoodie]] and walking away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--As this film has Sequel been released, additions to this section must be sourced, per WP:CRYSTAL-->\n* [[Sidharth Malhotra]] as Rishi Purohit/ Gaurav Kapoor  \n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as Kavya Rishi Purohit\n* [[Suniel Shetty]] as Colonel Vijay Kumar Saxena\n* [[Darshan Kumaar]] as Yakub Sabri\n* [[Hussain Dalal]] as Arth Dixit, Rishi's friend and colleague\n* [[Rajit Kapur]] as Kavya's father\n* [[Supriya Pilgaonkar]] as Kavya's mother\n* [[Amit Mistry]] as Jignesh Patel\n* [[Sijoy Varghese]] as Ramachandra Rao\n* [[Shaheed Woods]] as Koko\n* [[Kushal Punjabi]] as Willy\n* Zachary Coffin as CEO Jim\n* Hemant Koumar as Robbie\n* Nikita Sachdev as Nikki\n* [[Shahid Kapoor]] Gaurav Kapoor Plastic Before Surgery\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nSiddharth Anand has stated that the movie was originally envisioned as a sequel to the 2014 film [[Bang Bang!]] However, it was later clarified in an interview that the movie would be a standalone.<ref name=sequel>{{cite web | url = http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141012/entertainment-bollywood/article/bang-bang-sequel | title = Bang Bang sequel on?|website=[[Deccan Chronicle]] | date = 12 October 2014 | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/bang-bang%E2%80%99-a-sequel-in-the-pipeline_1481537.html | title = 'Bang Bang': A sequel in the pipeline? |website=Zeenews.india.com| date = 8 October 2014 | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ibtimes.co.in/hrithik-roshan-katrina-kaifs-bang-bang-have-sequel-soon-610704 | title = Hrithik Roshan, Katrina Kaif's 'Bang Bang' to have a Sequel Soon? |website=Ibtimes.co.in| date = 7 October 2014 | accessdate = 12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in mid-2016 under the working title ''Reloaded''.<ref name=\"bb2\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/sidharth-malhotra-gets-injured-on-reloaded-sets-4428364/ |title=Sidharth Malhotra gets injured on Reload sets |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2016-12-15 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref> In September 2016, it was reported that the international shooting schedule of ''A Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky'' had been canceled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-international-shooting-schedule-of-bang-bang-reloaded-scrapped-2254978 |title=International shooting schedule of 'Bang Bang Reloaded' scrapped &#124; Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis |website=Dnaindia.com |date=2016-09-14 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref> Later it was revealed by a close source that \"...there will be another long schedule in December but the location is yet to be finalised.
