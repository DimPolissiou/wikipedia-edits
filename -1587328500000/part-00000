Pratt]] from [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. The game was first manufactured by [[Waddingtons]] in the [[UK]] in 1949. Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company [[Hasbro]].\n\nThe object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players.\n\nNumerous games, books, [[Clue (film)|a film]], television series, and a musical have been released as part of the ''Cluedo'' franchise. Several spinoffs have been released featuring various extra characters, weapons and rooms, or different game play. The original game is marketed as the \"Classic Detective Game\", and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans.\n\nIn 2008, ''[[Cluedo: Discover the Secrets]]'' was created (with changes to board, gameplay and characters) as a modern spinoff, but it was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. ''Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game'' was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt's classic formula but also adding several variations. Hi \n\n\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1944, [[Anthony E. Pratt]], an English musician, applied for a [[patent]] of his invention of a murder/mystery-themed game, originally named \"Murder!\".<ref name=\"Invention\">L. A. Petrosjan, V. V. Mazalov (2002). \"Game Theory and Applications, Volume 8\". p. 26. Nova Publishers</ref> Shortly thereafter, Pratt and his wife, Elva Pratt (1913-1990), who had helped in designing the game, presented it to [[Waddingtons]]' executive, Norman Watson, who immediately purchased it and provided its trademark name of \"Cluedo\" (a play on \"clue\" and \"[[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]\"; ''ludo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''I play'', and a common British term for the game [[Parchesi]]).\n\nAlthough the patent was granted in 1947, due to [[WWII|postwar]] shortages in the UK the game was not officially launched by Waddingtons until 1949.<ref name=\"Invention\"/> It was simultaneously licensed to [[Parker Brothers]] in the US for publication, where it was renamed \"Clue\" along with other minor changes.<ref>{{cite book |first=Victor |last=Watson |year=2008 |title=The Waddingtons Story: From the early days to Monopoly, the Maxwell bids and into the next Millennium |location=Huddersfield |publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing |isbn=978-1-906600-36-5 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kmjwW4ZTMC&pg=PA81 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere were several differences between the original game concept and that initially published in 1949. In particular, Pratt's original design calls for [[Cluedo characters#Characters in the English versions of the game|ten characters]], one of whom was to be designated the victim by random drawing prior to the start of the game. These ten included the eliminated Mr Brown, Mr Gold, Miss Grey, and Mrs Silver. The characters of [[Cluedo characters#Mrs. White|Nurse White]] and [[Cluedo characters#Colonel Mustard|Colonel Yellow]] were renamed Mrs White and Colonel Mustard for the actual release. The game allowed for play of up to eight remaining characters, providing for nine suspects in total. Originally there were eleven rooms, including the eliminated \"[[Gunroom|gun room]]\" and cellar. In addition there were nine weapons including the unused [[bomb]], [[syringe]], [[shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] (walking stick/[[cudgel]]), [[fireplace poker]], and the later used [[axe]] and [[poison]]. Some of these unused weapons and characters appeared later in spin-off versions of the game.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\"/>\n\nSome gameplay aspects were different as well. Notably, the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved, rather than dealt directly to the players. Players also had to land on another player in order to make suggestions about that player's character through the use of special counter-tokens, and once exhausted, a player could no longer make suggestions. There were other minor differences, all of which were later updated by the game's initial release and remain essentially unchanged in the standard Classic Detective Game editions of the game.<ref name=ATP>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Treneman |date=12 November 1998 |title=Mr Pratt, in the old people's home, with an empty pocket |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/mr-pratt-in-the-old-peoples-home-with-an-empty-pocket-1184258.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210122936/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/mr-pratt-in-the-old-peoples-home-with-an-empty-pocket-1184258.html |accessdate=July 13, 2015|archivedate=February 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/clue/default.cfm?page=History&src=endeca |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929021146/http://www.hasbro.com/clue/default.cfm?page=History&src=endeca |archivedate=September 29, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite patent |country=GB |number=586817 |status=patent |title=Improvements in board games |gdate=April 1, 1947 |inventor=Pratt, Anthony Ernest}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news |date=20 December 2008 |title=Jack Mustard, in the spa, with a baseball bat |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/cluedo-new-rebrand-family |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe methodology used in the early versions of Cluedo is remarkably similar to a traditional, if little known, American [[card game]], [[The King of Hearts Has Five Sons]].<ref>[http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DeductionGames.shtml \"The Secret of Winning at Cluedo\" in ''Deduction Games''] at www.thegamesjournal.com.

Advertising at the time suggested players would take on the guise of \"Sherlock Holmes following the path of the criminal\", but no depictions of Holmes appear in the advertising or on the box.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mozart |first=Mike |url=http://classictoymuseum.blogspot.com/2010/01/clue-board-game-as-listed-in-1960-toy.html |title=Classic Toy Museum |publisher=Classictoymuseum.blogspot.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> By 1950 the game was simply marketed as \"The Great Detective Game\" until the 1960s, at which time it became: \"Parker Brothers Detective Game\". [[File:Cluedo 1956 Small Red Box Edition.jpg|thumbnail|Cluedo 1956 UK Edition depicting a Sherlock Holmes type character.]]With the launch of the US 1972 edition, a television commercial showed Holmes and Watson engaged in a particularly competitive game. Adjusting with the times, in 1979 US TV commercials a detective, resembling a bumbling [[Inspector Clouseau]] from the popular ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' film franchise, looks for clues.<ref>{{cite video\n| title = Parker Brothers - Clue (Commercial, 1979)\n| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj6izHRLHOI\n| publisher = Youtube\n| accessdate = 12 August 2012\n}}</ref> In 1986, the marketing slogan added \"Classic Detective Game\" which persists through the last 2002/2003 edition.\n\nIn the UK, Cluedo did not start using \"The Great Detective Game\" marketing slogan until the mid-1950s, which it continued using until the 2000 edition when it adopted the \"Classic Detective Game\" slogan.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\"/><ref name=\"winningmoves\"/> However, in the mid-1950s Waddingtons also adopted a Sherlock Holmes-type detective to adorn their box covers for a brief time, though unlike the US editions, there was no acknowledgement that the character was actually the famous detective. In the 1980s, as in the US, Sherlock Holmes also appeared in TV advertising of the time, along with other classic detectives such as [[Sam Spade]].<ref>{{cite video\n| title = Waddington's Cluedo\n| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYhKoOfxoco\n| publisher = Youtube\n| accessdate = 12 August 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==Game==\n===Equipment===\nThe game consists of a board which shows the rooms, corridors and secret-passages of an [[English country house]] called ''Tudor Mansion'' (named ''Tudor Close'', ''Tudor Hall'', ''Arlington Grange'', ''Boddy Manor'' or ''Boddy Mansion'' in some editions) in [[Hampshire, England]] in 1926. The game box also includes several coloured playing pieces to represent characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards (describing the aforementioned rooms, characters or weapons), ''Solution Cards'' envelope to contain one card from each set of cards, and a ''Detective's Notes'' pad on which are printed lists of rooms, weapons and characters, so players can keep detailed notes during the game.\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Cluedo characters}}\n[[File:Cluesuspectstokens.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The figurines and traditional set of North American & UK suspect tokens]]\nThe murder victim in the game is known as \"[[Cluedo characters#Dr. Black/Mr. Boddy|Dr. Black]]\" in the UK edition and \"Mr. Boddy\" in North American versions.\n\nPlayers' tokens are typically plastic [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] or [[figurine]]s; the standard edition of Cluedo has six of these suspects:\n* Miss Scarlett (the second ''t'' was dropped in North American versions after 1963) is red.\n* Rev. Green (''Mr. Green'' in North America) is green.\n* Colonel Mustard is yellow.\n* Professor Plum is purple.\n* Mrs. Peacock is blue.\n* Mrs. White is white.\n\nIn 2016, Hasbro launched the current standard version of the game with the first new original character in over 67 years: Dr. Orchid, replacing Mrs White.\n\n===Weapons===\nThe weapon icons are typically made of unfinished pewter (except the rope, which may be plastic or string); special editions have included gold plated, brass finished and [[sterling silver]] versions.\n\n* [[Candlestick]]\n* [[Dagger]] (''Knife'' in some North American editions)\n* [[Water pipe|Lead Pipe]] (called ''lead piping'' in earlier UK editions; the early tokens were made out of actual [[lead]] and therefore posed a risk of [[lead poisoning]])\n* [[Revolver]] (first depicted in the UK as a [[Dreyse M1907]] [[semi-automatic pistol]],<ref>[http://anonymous-generaltopics.blogspot.com/2010/02/dreyse-m1907.html Dreyse M1907] WORLD WAR II{{Self-published inline|date=June 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2018}}</ref> and in North America as a [[M1911 pistol|Colt M1911 pistol]].)\n* [[Rope]]\n* [[Wrench]] (depicted as a [[monkey wrench]] in North American editions; and an [[spanner|open-ended spanner]] in some traditional UK versions)\n\n===Rooms===\nThere are nine rooms in the mansion where the murder can take place, laid out in circular fashion on the game board, separated by pathways overlaid by playing spaces. Each of the four corner rooms contains a [[secret passage]] that leads to the room on the opposite diagonal corner of the map. The centre room (often referred to as the Cellar or Stairs) is inaccessible to the players, but contains the solution envelope, and is not otherwise used during game play. Coloured \"start\" spaces encircle the outer perimeter which correspond to each player's suspect token.

These cards represent the facts of the case. The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players.\n\nPlayers are instructed to assume the token/suspect nearest them. In older versions, play begins with Miss Scarlett and proceeds clockwise. In modern versions, all players roll the die/dice and the highest total starts the game, with play proceeding clockwise. Players roll the die/dice and move along the board's corridor spaces, or into the rooms accordingly.\n\nThe objective of the game is to [[Problem solving#Logic|deduce]] the details of the murder, i.e. the cards in the envelope. There are six [[Cluedo characters|characters]], six murder weapons and nine rooms, leaving the players with 324 possibilities. As soon as a player enters a room, they may make a suggestion as to the details, naming a suspect, room, and weapon. For example: \"I suggest it was Professor Plum, in the Dining Room, with the candlestick.\" The player's suggestion must include the room they are currently in; suggestions may not be made in the corridors. The tokens for the suggested suspect and weapon are immediately moved into that room, if they are not both already present. Suggesting an opponent's token is a legitimate board strategy; likewise the weapon icons, though esoteric. A player's suggestion may name themself as the murderer and may include cards in their own hand.\n\nOnce a player makes a suggestion, the others are called upon to disprove it. If the player to their left holds any of the three named cards, that player must privately show one (and only one) of the cards to them. If not, the process continues clockwise around the table until either one player disproves the suggestion, or no one can do so. A player's turn normally ends once their suggestion is completed.\n\nA player who believes they have determined the correct elements may make an accusation on their turn. The accusation can include any room, not necessarily the one occupied by the player (if any), and may be made immediately following a suggestion.<ref>[http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Clue_(2002).pdf '&#39;Cluedo/Clue'&#39; rules]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-06-15.</ref> The accusing player privately checks the three cards in the envelope. If they match the accusation, the player shows them to everyone and wins; if not, they return them to the envelope and may not move nor make suggestions/accusations for the remainder of the game; in effect, \"losing\". However, other players can move their token into rooms when making suggestions and they must continue to privately show cards in order to disprove suggestions. A player who makes a false accusation while blocking the door to a room must move into that room so others can enter and leave. If all players except for one player have made an incorrect accusation, the remaining player automatically wins.\n\nIf a player's suggestion has brought another player's token into a room, the second player may make their own suggestion in the room when their turn comes up, if desired. If not, they may move out of the room, and if able to reach another room, make a suggestion therein, as usual. In the American version, players are not allowed to make suggestions repeatedly by remaining in one room; if they wish to make a second suggestion, they must first spend a turn out of the room.\n\n====Choice of playing piece====\nThe first opportunity is in choosing the initial playing piece. Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one-space closer to the first room than any of the other players. Professor Plum can move to the study, and then take the secret-passage to the Kitchen, the hardest room to reach.<ref name=\"limitedgiftedition\">{{cite book\n| last = Orbanes\n| first = Phil\n| title = Limited Gift Edition Clue: The Story of Clue, Secrets of Great Clue Detectives\n| publication-place = Hathorne, MA\n| publisher = [[Winning Moves]]\n| year = 1997\n| pages = 3\u20134\n}}</ref> Traditionally, Miss Scarlett had the advantage of moving first. This has been eliminated with the implementation of the high roll rule in modern versions.\n\n====Navigating the board====\nThe next opportunity is choice of initial rooms to enter. Again Mrs. Peacock has an advantage in that she is closest to the Conservatory, a corner room with a secret passage, enabling a player on their turn to move immediately to another room and make a suggestion after rolling the dice. Miss Scarlett has a similar advantage with the Lounge. Making as many suggestions as possible gives a player an advantage to gain information. Therefore, moving into a new room as frequently as possible is one way to meet this goal. Players should make good use of the secret passages. Following the shortest path between rooms then is a good choice, even if a player already holds the card representing that room in their hand. As mentioned earlier, blocking passage of another player prevents them from attaining rooms from which to make suggestions. Various single space tracks on the board can therefore become traps, which are best avoided by a player when planning a path from room to room.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Making suggestions====\nEach player begins the game with three to six cards in their hand, depending on the number of players. Keeping track of which cards are shown to each player is important in deducing the solution. Detective Notes are supplied with the game to help make this task easier. The pads can keep not only a history of which cards are in a player's hand, but also which cards have been shown by another player. It can also be useful in deducing which cards the other players have shown one another. A player makes a suggestion to learn which cards may be eliminated from suspicion. However, in some cases it may be advantageous for a player to include one of their own cards in a suggestion. This technique can be used for both forcing a player to reveal a different card as well as misleading other players into believing a specific card is suspect. Therefore, moving into a room already held in the player's hand may work to their advantage. Suggestions may also be used to thwart a player's opponent. Since every suggestion results in a suspect token being re-located to the suggested room, a suggestion may be used to prevent another player from achieving their intended destination, preventing them from suggesting a particular room, especially if that player appears to be getting close to a solution.<ref name=\"limitedgiftedition\"/>\n\n====Notetaking====\nOne reason the game is enjoyed by many ages and skill levels is that the complexity of note-taking can increase as a player becomes more skillful. Beginners may simply mark off the cards they have been shown; more advanced players will keep track of who has and who does ''not'' have a particular card, possibly with the aid of an additional grid. Expert players may keep track of each suggestion made, knowing that the player who answers it must have at least one of the cards named; which one can be deduced by later events. One can also keep track of which cards a given player has seen, in order to minimize information revealed to that player and/or to read into that player's suggestions.\n\n==Editions==\nParker Brothers and Waddingtons each produced their own unique editions between 1949 and 1992. Hasbro purchased both companies in the early 1990s and continued to produce unique editions for each market until 2002/2003 when the current edition of Cluedo/Clue was first released. At this time, Hasbro produced a unified product across markets. The game was then localized with regional differences in spelling and naming conventions.\n\nDuring Cluedo's long history, eight unique Clue editions were published in North America (1949, '56/60, '60/63, '72, '86, '92, '96, and 2002), including miniaturized \"travel\" editions. However, only three distinct editions of Cluedo were released in the UK \u2013 the longest of which lasted 47 years from its introduction in 1949 until its first successor in 1996. The eighth North America and fourth UK editions constitute the current shared game design. International versions occasionally developed their own unique designs for specific editions. However, most drew on the designs and art from either the US or UK editions, and in some cases mixing elements from both, while localizing others \u2013 specifically suspect portraits.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\">{{cite book\n| last = Tim\n| first = Walsh\n| title = Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them\n| publication-place = Kansas City MO\n| publisher = [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]\n| year = 2005\n| pages = 84\u201387\n}}</ref><ref name=\"winningmoves\">{{cite book\n| last = Orbanes\n| first = Phil\n| title = Clue: The Great Detective Game \u2013 Memories: The Game Through The Years\n| publication-place = Danvers, MA\n| publisher = [[Winning Moves|Winning Moves, Inc.]]\n| year = 2003\n| pages = 2, 5\u20136\n}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped look for Clue in a Reinvention called Clue: Discover the Secrets. This new version of the game offered major changes to the game play and to the characters and their back stories.\n\nIn July 2016 Hasbro replaced Mrs White with a new character, [[Cluedo characters#Dr. Orchid|Dr. Orchid]], represented by an orchid pink piece. In this current standard edition, Mrs. Peacock has a new game opening opportunity as her starting square is one step closer to the billiard room (with 9{{nbsp}}steps instead of 10). The squared off door to the Conservatory makes the room harder for Mr Green to reach as an opening move and increases the distance between the Ballroom and the Conservatory (from 4{{nbsp}}steps to 5). This edition removes the side door in the Hall possibly for aesthetics, to increase the difficulty for Professor Plum, or removed in error.\n\nWhile the suspects' appearance and interior design of Dr. Black's/Mr. Boddy's mansion changed with each edition, the weapons underwent relatively minor changes, with the only major redesign occurring in the fourth 1972 US edition, which was adopted by the second 1996 UK edition and remains the standard configuration across all Classic Detective Game versions since. The artwork for the previous US editions tended to reflect the current popular style at the time they were released. The earlier UK editions were more artistically stylized themes. From 1972 on, the US editions presented lush box cover art depicting the six suspects in various candid poses within a room of the mansion. The UK would finally adopt this style only in its third release in 2000, prior to which Cluedo boxes depicted basic representations of the contents. Such lavish box art illustrations have become a hallmark of the game, since copied for the numerous licensed variants which pay homage to Clue.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\" /><ref name=\"winningmoves\" />\n\n===''Cluedo: Discover the Secrets''===\n{{Main|Cluedo: Discover the Secrets}}\n\nOn August 8, 2008, Hasbro redesigned and updated the board, characters, weapons, and rooms. Changes to the rules of game play were made, some to accommodate the new features.\n\nThe suspects have new given names and backgrounds, as well as differing abilities that may be used during the game. The revolver is now a pistol, the lead pipe and spanner/wrench have been removed, and a baseball bat, axe, dumbbell, trophy, and poison have been added. The nine rooms have changed to (in clockwise order): Hall, Guest House, Dining Room, Kitchen, Patio, Spa, Theatre, Living Room, and Observatory.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/article6874926.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000 Celebrating the 60th anniversary of Cluedo] The Times, 10/15/2009, by Damian Whitworth (retrieved 11/26/2009)</ref>\n\nThere is also a second deck of cards\u2014the Intrigue cards. In this deck, there are two types of cards, Keepers and Clocks. Keepers are special abilities; for example, \"You can see the card\". There are eight clocks\u2014the first seven drawn do nothing\u2014whoever draws the eighth is killed by the murderer and out of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93417780 |title=Hasbro Gives Clue Board Game A Makeover |accessdate=2008-08-16 |author=National Public Radio |date=2008-08-08 |authorlink=National Public Radio}}</ref>\n\nThe player must move to the indoor swimming pool in the centre of the board to make an accusation. This adds some challenge versus the ability to make accusations from anywhere in the original game.\n\nThe most significant change to game play is that once the suspect cards have been taken, the remaining cards are dealt so that all players have an even number of cards (rather than dealt out so that \"one player may have a slight advantage\"). This means that depending on the number of players a number of cards are left over. These cards are placed face down in the middle and are not seen unless a player takes a turn in the pool room to look at them.\n\nThe changes to the game have been criticized in the media for unnecessarily altering classic cultural icons. The game has also been criticized by lovers of the original game.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/cole-moreton-who-killed-cluedos-col-mustard-899619.html Who killed Cluedo's Col Mustard?] by Cole Moreton, The Independent, Sunday, 17 August 2008, retrieved 10/20/09</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3561463/The-makers-of-Cluedo-have-gone-and-killed-Professor-Plum.html The makers of Cluedo have gone and killed Professor Plum] Telegraph.co.uk By Robert Colvile\nPublished: 12:01AM BST 15 Aug 2008 (retrieved 11/1/09)</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017}}, Hasbro no longer sells the game via its website. However, they do continue to sell a version of it as part of their ''Grab & Go'' travel series.

The object of the game to determine who killed the game's victim Dr Black, with what weapon? In which room? The player, as one of the six suspects, will ask questions and take notes. The overall goal being to solve the crime first.\n\n===Notable editions===\n* ''Clue \"Master Detective\"'' (1988),<ref>{{bgg title|1561|Clue Master Detective}}</ref> an expanded version of the game featuring 12 rooms, 10 characters, and eight weapons, with support for up to 10 players. In addition to the regular cast, ''Clue Master Detective'' adds Miss Peach, Monsieur Brunette, Madame Rose and Sergeant Gray to the list of suspects.\n* ''Cluedo: 50th Anniversary'' (1999),{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} also released as ''Clue: 50th Anniversary'', this standard edition came in a \"deluxe\" format with the option to play with an extra murder weapon, a bottle of poison. This edition was also issued in a miniaturised Cluedo European travel version. [[Drew Struzan]] provided artwork for the game, which was originally created for the US 1996 edition and additionally used for ''The Limited Gift Edition'' and the US ''Clue Card Game'' (he did not create the Rev. Green portrait used in the ''Cluedo'' editions).<ref>[http://www.drewstruzan.com/illustrated/portfolio/?fa=medium&gid=793&co&gallerystart=1&pagestart=1&type=co&gs=1 Portfolio Products Clue/Parker Brothers] Drew Struzan Illustrated Works</ref>\n* ''Clue \"Nostalgia Edition\"'' (2003, 2007)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bgg title|19190|Nostalgia Wooden Box Edition}}</ref> Hasbro began offering a retro Nostalgia edition of the game, essentially a re-issue of the 1963 design in a wooden box.

In the Cluedo version, they continued to use the 1963 design and adapted it for the UK market for the first time with localised characters and naming conventions.\n\n==Franchise==\n{{Main|Cluedo (franchise)}}\nThe board game spawned a franchise, which since 1985, has expanded to include a feature [[Clue (film)|film]], [[Clue (miniseries)|mini-series]], a musical, and numerous books.\n\n==Worldwide differences==\n\nBesides some rule differences listed above, some versions label differently the names of characters, weapons, rooms and in some instances the actual game itself.\n\nIn Canada and the U.S., the game is known as ''Clue.'' It was retitled because the traditional British board game ''[[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]'', on which the name is based, was less well known there than its American variant ''[[Parcheesi]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/cluemasterdetective.pdf |title=Master detective. Modus operandi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe North American versions of ''Clue'' also replace the character \"Reverend Green\" from the original ''Cluedo'' with \"Mr. Green.\" This is the only region to continue to make such a change. Minor changes include \"Miss Scarlett\" with her name being spelt with one 't', the spanner being called a wrench, and the dagger renamed a knife. In the 2016 U.S. edition, the knife was changed to a dagger. And until 2003, the lead piping was known as the lead pipe only in the North American edition.\n\nIn some international versions of the game (mostly the [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] ones) the colours of some pieces are different, so as to correspond with the changes to each suspect's unique foreign name variations. In some cases, rooms and weapons are changed in addition to other regional variances.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn South America it is licensed and sold under several different names. In particular, it is notably marketed as ''Detetive'' in [[Brazil]].\n\nIn [[Norway]] it was first released as ''Scotland Yard'' by Damm. It was later re-released as ''Cluedo'', but the rules are the same.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Cluedo characters|List of ''Cluedo'' characters]]\n* [[Clue (1992 video game)|''Clue'' (1992 video game)]]\n* [[Clue (1998 video game)|''Clue'' (1998 video game)]]\n* [[Clue (mobile games)|''Clue'' (mobile games)]]\n* ''[[13 Dead End Drive]]'' (related board game)\n* ''[[Kill Doctor Lucky]]'' (related board game and parody)\n* ''[[Selchow and Righter|Mr. Ree!]]'' (related board game)\n* ''[[Orient Express (board game)|Orient Express]]'' (related board game)\n* ''[[Selchow and Righter|Whodunit]]'' (related board game)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/en-us/product/clue-game-2013-edition:9BCB9C5E-5056-9047-F505-6D1166C5961E/ Clue official website] Hasbro (US site)\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20000823035634/http://www.cluedo.com/clue/intro.html 50th Anniversary web site] (at Archive.org) official 1999\u20132000 product line\n* [http://www.cluedofan.com/ Cluedofan.com]\u2014A detailed resource, including information on film & television productions\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20170202082217/http://www.cluedofan.com/foreign.htm List of international Cluedo/Clue editions] at Cluedofan.com\n* [http://www.theartofmurder.com/ TheArtofMurder.com] \u2013 A well organized and detailed site maintained by a US collector\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416004008/http://www.rm7guy.co.uk/Cluedo.htm#CLUEDO%20MAIN%20INDEX Pete's CLUEDO fan site] \u2013 A detailed site with component images from every edition of the game.\n* {{bgg title|1294}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj6izHRLHOI 1979 U.S. Clue television commercial]\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Clue_(2002).pdf U.S. Clue rules (2002)]\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad2885d1c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/2BFAEC9E5056900B102C3859E9AC6332.pdf U.S. Clue rules (2011)]\n\n{{Cluedo}}\n{{Hasbro}}\n{{Waddingtons}}\n\n[[Category:Cluedo| ]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1926]]\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1949]]\n[[Category:British board games]]\n[[Category:Deduction board games]]\n[[Category:Hampshire in fiction]]\n[[Category:Parker Brothers games]]\n[[Category:Roll-and-move board games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Board game}} \n{{other uses|Cluedo (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2014}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox game\n| title = ''Cluedo''\n| italic title = yes\n| subtitle = The Classic Mystery Game\n| image_link = [[File:Cluedo Clue pack logo.png|250px]]\n| image_caption = The ''Cluedo'' and ''Clue'' logos (2015\u2013present)\n| designer = [[Anthony E.

Pratt]] from [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. The game was first manufactured by [[Waddingtons]] in the [[UK]] in 1949. Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company [[Hasbro]].\n\nThe object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players.\n\nNumerous games, books, [[Clue (film)|a film]], television series, and a musical have been released as part of the ''Cluedo'' franchise. Several spinoffs have been released featuring various extra characters, weapons and rooms, or different game play. The original game is marketed as the \"Classic Detective Game\", and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans.\n\nIn 2008, ''[[Cluedo: Discover the Secrets]]'' was created (with changes to board, gameplay and characters) as a modern spinoff, but it was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. ''Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game'' was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt's classic formula but also adding several variations.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1944, [[Anthony E.

Nova Publishers</ref> Shortly thereafter, Pratt and his wife, Elva Pratt (1913-1990), who had helped in designing the game, presented it to [[Waddingtons]]' executive, Norman Watson, who immediately purchased it and provided its trademark name of \"Cluedo\" (a play on \"clue\" and \"[[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]\"; ''ludo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''I play'', and a common British term for the game [[Parchesi]]).\n\nAlthough the patent was granted in 1947, due to [[WWII|postwar]] shortages in the UK the game was not officially launched by Waddingtons until 1949.<ref name=\"Invention\"/> It was simultaneously licensed to [[Parker Brothers]] in the US for publication, where it was renamed \"Clue\" along with other minor changes.<ref>{{cite book |first=Victor |last=Watson |year=2008 |title=The Waddingtons Story: From the early days to Monopoly, the Maxwell bids and into the next Millennium |location=Huddersfield |publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing |isbn=978-1-906600-36-5 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kmjwW4ZTMC&pg=PA81 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere were several differences between the original game concept and that initially published in 1949. In particular, Pratt's original design calls for [[Cluedo characters#Characters in the English versions of the game|ten characters]], one of whom was to be designated the victim by random drawing prior to the start of the game. These ten included the eliminated Mr Brown, Mr Gold, Miss Grey, and Mrs Silver. The characters of [[Cluedo characters#Mrs. White|Nurse White]] and [[Cluedo characters#Colonel Mustard|Colonel Yellow]] were renamed Mrs White and Colonel Mustard for the actual release. The game allowed for play of up to eight remaining characters, providing for nine suspects in total. Originally there were eleven rooms, including the eliminated \"[[Gunroom|gun room]]\" and cellar. In addition there were nine weapons including the unused [[bomb]], [[syringe]], [[shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] (walking stick/[[cudgel]]), [[fireplace poker]], and the later used [[axe]] and [[poison]]. Some of these unused weapons and characters appeared later in spin-off versions of the game.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\"/>\n\nSome gameplay aspects were different as well. Notably, the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved, rather than dealt directly to the players. Players also had to land on another player in order to make suggestions about that player's character through the use of special counter-tokens, and once exhausted, a player could no longer make suggestions. There were other minor differences, all of which were later updated by the game's initial release and remain essentially unchanged in the standard Classic Detective Game editions of the game.<ref name=ATP>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Treneman |date=12 November 1998 |title=Mr Pratt, in the old people's home, with an empty pocket |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/mr-pratt-in-the-old-peoples-home-with-an-empty-pocket-1184258.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210122936/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/mr-pratt-in-the-old-peoples-home-with-an-empty-pocket-1184258.html |accessdate=July 13, 2015|archivedate=February 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/clue/default.cfm?page=History&src=endeca |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929021146/http://www.hasbro.com/clue/default.cfm?page=History&src=endeca |archivedate=September 29, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite patent |country=GB |number=586817 |status=patent |title=Improvements in board games |gdate=April 1, 1947 |inventor=Pratt, Anthony Ernest}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news |date=20 December 2008 |title=Jack Mustard, in the spa, with a baseball bat |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/cluedo-new-rebrand-family |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe methodology used in the early versions of Cluedo is remarkably similar to a traditional, if little known, American [[card game]], [[The King of Hearts Has Five Sons]].<ref>[http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DeductionGames.shtml \"The Secret of Winning at Cluedo\" in ''Deduction Games''] at www.thegamesjournal.com.

Advertising at the time suggested players would take on the guise of \"Sherlock Holmes following the path of the criminal\", but no depictions of Holmes appear in the advertising or on the box.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mozart |first=Mike |url=http://classictoymuseum.blogspot.com/2010/01/clue-board-game-as-listed-in-1960-toy.html |title=Classic Toy Museum |publisher=Classictoymuseum.blogspot.com |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> By 1950 the game was simply marketed as \"The Great Detective Game\" until the 1960s, at which time it became: \"Parker Brothers Detective Game\". [[File:Cluedo 1956 Small Red Box Edition.jpg|thumbnail|Cluedo 1956 UK Edition depicting a Sherlock Holmes type character.]]With the launch of the US 1972 edition, a television commercial showed Holmes and Watson engaged in a particularly competitive game. Adjusting with the times, in 1979 US TV commercials a detective, resembling a bumbling [[Inspector Clouseau]] from the popular ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' film franchise, looks for clues.<ref>{{cite video\n| title = Parker Brothers - Clue (Commercial, 1979)\n| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj6izHRLHOI\n| publisher = Youtube\n| accessdate = 12 August 2012\n}}</ref> In 1986, the marketing slogan added \"Classic Detective Game\" which persists through the last 2002/2003 edition.\n\nIn the UK, Cluedo did not start using \"The Great Detective Game\" marketing slogan until the mid-1950s, which it continued using until the 2000 edition when it adopted the \"Classic Detective Game\" slogan.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\"/><ref name=\"winningmoves\"/> However, in the mid-1950s Waddingtons also adopted a Sherlock Holmes-type detective to adorn their box covers for a brief time, though unlike the US editions, there was no acknowledgement that the character was actually the famous detective. In the 1980s, as in the US, Sherlock Holmes also appeared in TV advertising of the time, along with other classic detectives such as [[Sam Spade]].<ref>{{cite video\n| title = Waddington's Cluedo\n| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYhKoOfxoco\n| publisher = Youtube\n| accessdate = 12 August 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==Game==\n===Equipment===\nThe game consists of a board which shows the rooms, corridors and secret-passages of an [[English country house]] called ''Tudor Mansion'' (named ''Tudor Close'', ''Tudor Hall'', ''Arlington Grange'', ''Boddy Manor'' or ''Boddy Mansion'' in some editions) in [[Hampshire, England]] in 1926. The game box also includes several coloured playing pieces to represent characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards (describing the aforementioned rooms, characters or weapons), ''Solution Cards'' envelope to contain one card from each set of cards, and a ''Detective's Notes'' pad on which are printed lists of rooms, weapons and characters, so players can keep detailed notes during the game.\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Cluedo characters}}\n[[File:Cluesuspectstokens.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The figurines and traditional set of North American & UK suspect tokens]]\nThe murder victim in the game is known as \"[[Cluedo characters#Dr. Black/Mr. Boddy|Dr. Black]]\" in the UK edition and \"Mr. Boddy\" in North American versions.\n\nPlayers' tokens are typically plastic [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] or [[figurine]]s; the standard edition of Cluedo has six of these suspects:\n* Miss Scarlett (the second ''t'' was dropped in North American versions after 1963) is red.\n* Rev. Green (''Mr. Green'' in North America) is green.\n* Colonel Mustard is yellow.\n* Professor Plum is purple.\n* Mrs. Peacock is blue.\n* Mrs. White is white.\n\nIn 2016, Hasbro launched the current standard version of the game with the first new original character in over 67 years: Dr. Orchid, replacing Mrs White.\n\n===Weapons===\nThe weapon icons are typically made of unfinished pewter (except the rope, which may be plastic or string); special editions have included gold plated, brass finished and [[sterling silver]] versions.\n\n* [[Candlestick]]\n* [[Dagger]] (''Knife'' in some North American editions)\n* [[Water pipe|Lead Pipe]] (called ''lead piping'' in earlier UK editions; the early tokens were made out of actual [[lead]] and therefore posed a risk of [[lead poisoning]])\n* [[Revolver]] (first depicted in the UK as a [[Dreyse M1907]] [[semi-automatic pistol]],<ref>[http://anonymous-generaltopics.blogspot.com/2010/02/dreyse-m1907.html Dreyse M1907] WORLD WAR II{{Self-published inline|date=June 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2018}}</ref> and in North America as a [[M1911 pistol|Colt M1911 pistol]].)\n* [[Rope]]\n* [[Wrench]] (depicted as a [[monkey wrench]] in North American editions; and an [[spanner|open-ended spanner]] in some traditional UK versions)\n\n===Rooms===\nThere are nine rooms in the mansion where the murder can take place, laid out in circular fashion on the game board, separated by pathways overlaid by playing spaces. Each of the four corner rooms contains a [[secret passage]] that leads to the room on the opposite diagonal corner of the map. The centre room (often referred to as the Cellar or Stairs) is inaccessible to the players, but contains the solution envelope, and is not otherwise used during game play. Coloured \"start\" spaces encircle the outer perimeter which correspond to each player's suspect token. Each character starts at the corresponding coloured space.\n\n{| style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid black; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#fff;\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"3\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#0f0;\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:10px; border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n|  style=\"height:30px; width:90px; text-align:left;\"| &nbsp;\u2020\n| rowspan=\"11\" style=\"border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"| &nbsp; &nbsp;\n|  style=\"width:10px; height:30px;\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|  style=\"width:30px; height:90px;\" rowspan=\"3\"| [[Ballroom]]\n|  style=\"width:10px; height:30px;\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n| rowspan=\"11\" style=\"border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"| &nbsp; &nbsp;\n|  style=\"height:30px; width:90px; text-align:right;\"| \u2021&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:10px; border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"height:30px;\"| [[Kitchen]]\n| style=\"height:30px;\"| [[Sunroom|Conservatory]]\n|-\n| style=\"height:30px;\"|\n| style=\"height:30px;\"|\n|-\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"7\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#00f;\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"height:90px; border:1px solid black;\"| [[Dining room|Dining Room]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"width:20px; border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"height:90px; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|[[Basement|Cellar]]<br/>''(with''<br/>''envelope'')\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"width:20px; border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n|  style=\"height:40px; border:1px solid black;\"| [[Billiard room|Billiard Room]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n|-\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:5px; background:#000;\"|\n|-\n|  style=\"height:45px; border:1px solid black;\"| [[Library]]\n|-\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#ff0;\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"7\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#93C;\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n| style=\"height:30px;\"|\n|  style=\"width:10px; height:30px;\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|  style=\"width:30px; height:90px;\" rowspan=\"3\"| [[Hall]]\n|  style=\"width:10px; height:30px;\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n| style=\"height:30px;\"|\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid black; height:30px; background:#000;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"height:30px;\"| [[Living room|Lounge]]\n| style=\"height:30px;\"| [[Study (room)|Study]]\n|-\n|  style=\"height:30px; text-align:left;\"| &nbsp;\u2021\n|  style=\"height:30px; text-align:right;\"| \u2020&nbsp;\n|-\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#f00;\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"3\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\"|\n|  style=\"border:1px solid black; height:10px; background:#000;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n|}\n\u2020 \u2021 ''denote secret passages to opposite corner''\n\n===Rules===\nAt the beginning of play, three cards\u2014one suspect, one room, and one weapon\u2014are chosen at random and put into a special envelope, so that no one can see them. These cards represent the facts of the case. The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players.\n\nPlayers are instructed to assume the token/suspect nearest them. In older versions, play begins with Miss Scarlett and proceeds clockwise. In modern versions, all players roll the die/dice and the highest total starts the game, with play proceeding clockwise. Players roll the die/dice and move along the board's corridor spaces, or into the rooms accordingly.\n\nThe objective of the game is to [[Problem solving#Logic|deduce]] the details of the murder, i.e. the cards in the envelope. There are six [[Cluedo characters|characters]], six murder weapons and nine rooms, leaving the players with 324 possibilities. As soon as a player enters a room, they may make a suggestion as to the details, naming a suspect, room, and weapon. For example: \"I suggest it was Professor Plum, in the Dining Room, with the candlestick.\" The player's suggestion must include the room they are currently in; suggestions may not be made in the corridors. The tokens for the suggested suspect and weapon are immediately moved into that room, if they are not both already present. Suggesting an opponent's token is a legitimate board strategy; likewise the weapon icons, though esoteric. A player's suggestion may name themself as the murderer and may include cards in their own hand.\n\nOnce a player makes a suggestion, the others are called upon to disprove it. If the player to their left holds any of the three named cards, that player must privately show one (and only one) of the cards to them. If not, the process continues clockwise around the table until either one player disproves the suggestion, or no one can do so. A player's turn normally ends once their suggestion is completed.\n\nA player who believes they have determined the correct elements may make an accusation on their turn. The accusation can include any room, not necessarily the one occupied by the player (if any), and may be made immediately following a suggestion.<ref>[http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Clue_(2002).pdf '&#39;Cluedo/Clue'&#39; rules]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-06-15.</ref> The accusing player privately checks the three cards in the envelope. If they match the accusation, the player shows them to everyone and wins; if not, they return them to the envelope and may not move nor make suggestions/accusations for the remainder of the game; in effect, \"losing\". However, other players can move their token into rooms when making suggestions and they must continue to privately show cards in order to disprove suggestions. A player who makes a false accusation while blocking the door to a room must move into that room so others can enter and leave. If all players except for one player have made an incorrect accusation, the remaining player automatically wins.\n\nIf a player's suggestion has brought another player's token into a room, the second player may make their own suggestion in the room when their turn comes up, if desired. If not, they may move out of the room, and if able to reach another room, make a suggestion therein, as usual. In the American version, players are not allowed to make suggestions repeatedly by remaining in one room; if they wish to make a second suggestion, they must first spend a turn out of the room.\n\n====Choice of playing piece====\nThe first opportunity is in choosing the initial playing piece. Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one-space closer to the first room than any of the other players. Professor Plum can move to the study, and then take the secret-passage to the Kitchen, the hardest room to reach.<ref name=\"limitedgiftedition\">{{cite book\n| last = Orbanes\n| first = Phil\n| title = Limited Gift Edition Clue: The Story of Clue, Secrets of Great Clue Detectives\n| publication-place = Hathorne, MA\n| publisher = [[Winning Moves]]\n| year = 1997\n| pages = 3\u20134\n}}</ref> Traditionally, Miss Scarlett had the advantage of moving first. This has been eliminated with the implementation of the high roll rule in modern versions.\n\n====Navigating the board====\nThe next opportunity is choice of initial rooms to enter. Again Mrs. Peacock has an advantage in that she is closest to the Conservatory, a corner room with a secret passage, enabling a player on their turn to move immediately to another room and make a suggestion after rolling the dice. Miss Scarlett has a similar advantage with the Lounge. Making as many suggestions as possible gives a player an advantage to gain information. Therefore, moving into a new room as frequently as possible is one way to meet this goal. Players should make good use of the secret passages. Following the shortest path between rooms then is a good choice, even if a player already holds the card representing that room in their hand. As mentioned earlier, blocking passage of another player prevents them from attaining rooms from which to make suggestions. Various single space tracks on the board can therefore become traps, which are best avoided by a player when planning a path from room to room.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Making suggestions====\nEach player begins the game with three to six cards in their hand, depending on the number of players. Keeping track of which cards are shown to each player is important in deducing the solution. Detective Notes are supplied with the game to help make this task easier. The pads can keep not only a history of which cards are in a player's hand, but also which cards have been shown by another player. It can also be useful in deducing which cards the other players have shown one another. A player makes a suggestion to learn which cards may be eliminated from suspicion. However, in some cases it may be advantageous for a player to include one of their own cards in a suggestion. This technique can be used for both forcing a player to reveal a different card as well as misleading other players into believing a specific card is suspect. Therefore, moving into a room already held in the player's hand may work to their advantage. Suggestions may also be used to thwart a player's opponent. Since every suggestion results in a suspect token being re-located to the suggested room, a suggestion may be used to prevent another player from achieving their intended destination, preventing them from suggesting a particular room, especially if that player appears to be getting close to a solution.<ref name=\"limitedgiftedition\"/>\n\n====Notetaking====\nOne reason the game is enjoyed by many ages and skill levels is that the complexity of note-taking can increase as a player becomes more skillful. Beginners may simply mark off the cards they have been shown; more advanced players will keep track of who has and who does ''not'' have a particular card, possibly with the aid of an additional grid. Expert players may keep track of each suggestion made, knowing that the player who answers it must have at least one of the cards named; which one can be deduced by later events. One can also keep track of which cards a given player has seen, in order to minimize information revealed to that player and/or to read into that player's suggestions.\n\n==Editions==\nParker Brothers and Waddingtons each produced their own unique editions between 1949 and 1992. Hasbro purchased both companies in the early 1990s and continued to produce unique editions for each market until 2002/2003 when the current edition of Cluedo/Clue was first released. At this time, Hasbro produced a unified product across markets. The game was then localized with regional differences in spelling and naming conventions.\n\nDuring Cluedo's long history, eight unique Clue editions were published in North America (1949, '56/60, '60/63, '72, '86, '92, '96, and 2002), including miniaturized \"travel\" editions. However, only three distinct editions of Cluedo were released in the UK \u2013 the longest of which lasted 47 years from its introduction in 1949 until its first successor in 1996. The eighth North America and fourth UK editions constitute the current shared game design. International versions occasionally developed their own unique designs for specific editions. However, most drew on the designs and art from either the US or UK editions, and in some cases mixing elements from both, while localizing others \u2013 specifically suspect portraits.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\">{{cite book\n| last = Tim\n| first = Walsh\n| title = Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them\n| publication-place = Kansas City MO\n| publisher = [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]\n| year = 2005\n| pages = 84\u201387\n}}</ref><ref name=\"winningmoves\">{{cite book\n| last = Orbanes\n| first = Phil\n| title = Clue: The Great Detective Game \u2013 Memories: The Game Through The Years\n| publication-place = Danvers, MA\n| publisher = [[Winning Moves|Winning Moves, Inc.]]\n| year = 2003\n| pages = 2, 5\u20136\n}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped look for Clue in a Reinvention called Clue: Discover the Secrets. This new version of the game offered major changes to the game play and to the characters and their back stories.\n\nIn July 2016 Hasbro replaced Mrs White with a new character, [[Cluedo characters#Dr. Orchid|Dr. Orchid]], represented by an orchid pink piece. In this current standard edition, Mrs. Peacock has a new game opening opportunity as her starting square is one step closer to the billiard room (with 9{{nbsp}}steps instead of 10). The squared off door to the Conservatory makes the room harder for Mr Green to reach as an opening move and increases the distance between the Ballroom and the Conservatory (from 4{{nbsp}}steps to 5). This edition removes the side door in the Hall possibly for aesthetics, to increase the difficulty for Professor Plum, or removed in error.\n\nWhile the suspects' appearance and interior design of Dr. Black's/Mr. Boddy's mansion changed with each edition, the weapons underwent relatively minor changes, with the only major redesign occurring in the fourth 1972 US edition, which was adopted by the second 1996 UK edition and remains the standard configuration across all Classic Detective Game versions since. The artwork for the previous US editions tended to reflect the current popular style at the time they were released. The earlier UK editions were more artistically stylized themes. From 1972 on, the US editions presented lush box cover art depicting the six suspects in various candid poses within a room of the mansion. The UK would finally adopt this style only in its third release in 2000, prior to which Cluedo boxes depicted basic representations of the contents. Such lavish box art illustrations have become a hallmark of the game, since copied for the numerous licensed variants which pay homage to Clue.<ref name=\"timelesstoys\" /><ref name=\"winningmoves\" />\n\n===''Cluedo: Discover the Secrets''===\n{{Main|Cluedo: Discover the Secrets}}\n\nOn August 8, 2008, Hasbro redesigned and updated the board, characters, weapons, and rooms. Changes to the rules of game play were made, some to accommodate the new features.\n\nThe suspects have new given names and backgrounds, as well as differing abilities that may be used during the game. The revolver is now a pistol, the lead pipe and spanner/wrench have been removed, and a baseball bat, axe, dumbbell, trophy, and poison have been added. The nine rooms have changed to (in clockwise order): Hall, Guest House, Dining Room, Kitchen, Patio, Spa, Theatre, Living Room, and Observatory.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/article6874926.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000 Celebrating the 60th anniversary of Cluedo] The Times, 10/15/2009, by Damian Whitworth (retrieved 11/26/2009)</ref>\n\nThere is also a second deck of cards\u2014the Intrigue cards. In this deck, there are two types of cards, Keepers and Clocks. Keepers are special abilities; for example, \"You can see the card\". There are eight clocks\u2014the first seven drawn do nothing\u2014whoever draws the eighth is killed by the murderer and out of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93417780 |title=Hasbro Gives Clue Board Game A Makeover |accessdate=2008-08-16 |author=National Public Radio |date=2008-08-08 |authorlink=National Public Radio}}</ref>\n\nThe player must move to the indoor swimming pool in the centre of the board to make an accusation. This adds some challenge versus the ability to make accusations from anywhere in the original game.\n\nThe most significant change to game play is that once the suspect cards have been taken, the remaining cards are dealt so that all players have an even number of cards (rather than dealt out so that \"one player may have a slight advantage\"). This means that depending on the number of players a number of cards are left over. These cards are placed face down in the middle and are not seen unless a player takes a turn in the pool room to look at them.\n\nThe changes to the game have been criticized in the media for unnecessarily altering classic cultural icons. The game has also been criticized by lovers of the original game.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/cole-moreton-who-killed-cluedos-col-mustard-899619.html Who killed Cluedo's Col Mustard?] by Cole Moreton, The Independent, Sunday, 17 August 2008, retrieved 10/20/09</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3561463/The-makers-of-Cluedo-have-gone-and-killed-Professor-Plum.html The makers of Cluedo have gone and killed Professor Plum] Telegraph.co.uk By Robert Colvile\nPublished: 12:01AM BST 15 Aug 2008 (retrieved 11/1/09)</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017}}, Hasbro no longer sells the game via its website.

However, the Intrigue cards are no longer a part of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/SearchDisplay?categoryId=&storeId=10151&catalogId=10051&langId=-1&sType=SimpleSearch&resultCatEntryType=2&showResultsPage=true&searchSource=Q&pageView=&beginIndex=0&pageSize=18&searchTerm=clue#facet:&productBeginIndex:0&orderBy:&pageView:grid&minPrice:&maxPrice:&pageSize:& |title=Hasbro Toy Shop |publisher=Hasbrotoyshop.com |date= |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===''Clue/Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game''===\n{{Main|Clue (mobile games)}}\nCLUE/CLUEDO the digital adaptation is based on the official Hasbro board game developed by [[Marmalade Game Studio]] for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile device]]s as well as [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. The object of the game to determine who killed the game's victim Dr Black, with what weapon? In which room? The player, as one of the six suspects, will ask questions and take notes. The overall goal being to solve the crime first.\n\n===Notable editions===\n* ''Clue \"Master Detective\"'' (1988),<ref>{{bgg title|1561|Clue Master Detective}}</ref> an expanded version of the game featuring 12 rooms, 10 characters, and eight weapons, with support for up to 10 players. In addition to the regular cast, ''Clue Master Detective'' adds Miss Peach, Monsieur Brunette, Madame Rose and Sergeant Gray to the list of suspects.\n* ''Cluedo: 50th Anniversary'' (1999),{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} also released as ''Clue: 50th Anniversary'', this standard edition came in a \"deluxe\" format with the option to play with an extra murder weapon, a bottle of poison. This edition was also issued in a miniaturised Cluedo European travel version. [[Drew Struzan]] provided artwork for the game, which was originally created for the US 1996 edition and additionally used for ''The Limited Gift Edition'' and the US ''Clue Card Game'' (he did not create the Rev. Green portrait used in the ''Cluedo'' editions).<ref>[http://www.drewstruzan.com/illustrated/portfolio/?fa=medium&gid=793&co&gallerystart=1&pagestart=1&type=co&gs=1 Portfolio Products Clue/Parker Brothers] Drew Struzan Illustrated Works</ref>\n* ''Clue \"Nostalgia Edition\"'' (2003, 2007)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bgg title|19190|Nostalgia Wooden Box Edition}}</ref> Hasbro began offering a retro Nostalgia edition of the game, essentially a re-issue of the 1963 design in a wooden box. A custom version of the game was also released in the US by [[Restoration Hardware]] as ''Wooden Box Clue'' with different cover art.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wooden Box Clue&#174; - No Longer Available |url=http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod1393059 |title=Restoration Hardware Wood Box Clue |publisher=Restorationhardware.com |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> In the UK it was released under the Cluedo brand, and was an official re-issue of the original 1949 Waddingtons' design.\n* ''Clue \"Vintage Edition\"'' (2005, 2009),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> also released as'' Cluedo \"Vintage Edition\"'', Hasbro re-formatted the nostalgia edition into a \"vintage\" bookshelf collection along with a series of other popular boardgames. In the Cluedo version, they continued to use the 1963 design and adapted it for the UK market for the first time with localised characters and naming conventions.\n\n==Franchise==\n{{Main|Cluedo (franchise)}}\nThe board game spawned a franchise, which since 1985, has expanded to include a feature [[Clue (film)|film]], [[Clue (miniseries)|mini-series]], a musical, and numerous books.\n\n==Worldwide differences==\n\nBesides some rule differences listed above, some versions label differently the names of characters, weapons, rooms and in some instances the actual game itself.\n\nIn Canada and the U.S., the game is known as ''Clue.'' It was retitled because the traditional British board game ''[[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]'', on which the name is based, was less well known there than its American variant ''[[Parcheesi]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/cluemasterdetective.pdf |title=Master detective. Modus operandi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe North American versions of ''Clue'' also replace the character \"Reverend Green\" from the original ''Cluedo'' with \"Mr. Green.\" This is the only region to continue to make such a change. Minor changes include \"Miss Scarlett\" with her name being spelt with one 't', the spanner being called a wrench, and the dagger renamed a knife. In the 2016 U.S. edition, the knife was changed to a dagger. And until 2003, the lead piping was known as the lead pipe only in the North American edition.\n\nIn some international versions of the game (mostly the [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] ones) the colours of some pieces are different, so as to correspond with the changes to each suspect's unique foreign name variations. In some cases, rooms and weapons are changed in addition to other regional variances.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn South America it is licensed and sold under several different names. In particular, it is notably marketed as ''Detetive'' in [[Brazil]].\n\nIn [[Norway]] it was first released as ''Scotland Yard'' by Damm. It was later re-released as ''Cluedo'', but the rules are the same.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Cluedo characters|List of ''Cluedo'' characters]]\n* [[Clue (1992 video game)|''Clue'' (1992 video game)]]\n* [[Clue (1998 video game)|''Clue'' (1998 video game)]]\n* [[Clue (mobile games)|''Clue'' (mobile games)]]\n* ''[[13 Dead End Drive]]'' (related board game)\n* ''[[Kill Doctor Lucky]]'' (related board game and parody)\n* ''[[Selchow and Righter|Mr. Ree!]]'' (related board game)\n* ''[[Orient Express (board game)|Orient Express]]'' (related board game)\n* ''[[Selchow and Righter|Whodunit]]'' (related board game)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/en-us/product/clue-game-2013-edition:9BCB9C5E-5056-9047-F505-6D1166C5961E/ Clue official website] Hasbro (US site)\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20000823035634/http://www.cluedo.com/clue/intro.html 50th Anniversary web site] (at Archive.org) official 1999\u20132000 product line\n* [http://www.cluedofan.com/ Cluedofan.com]\u2014A detailed resource, including information on film & television productions\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20170202082217/http://www.cluedofan.com/foreign.htm List of international Cluedo/Clue editions] at Cluedofan.com\n* [http://www.theartofmurder.com/ TheArtofMurder.com] \u2013 A well organized and detailed site maintained by a US collector\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416004008/http://www.rm7guy.co.uk/Cluedo.htm#CLUEDO%20MAIN%20INDEX Pete's CLUEDO fan site] \u2013 A detailed site with component images from every edition of the game.\n* {{bgg title|1294}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj6izHRLHOI 1979 U.S. Clue television commercial]\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Clue_(2002).pdf U.S. Clue rules (2002)]\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad2885d1c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/2BFAEC9E5056900B102C3859E9AC6332.pdf U.S. Clue rules (2011)]\n\n{{Cluedo}}\n{{Hasbro}}\n{{Waddingtons}}\n\n[[Category:Cluedo| ]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1926]]\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1949]]\n[[Category:British board games]]\n[[Category:Deduction board games]]\n[[Category:Hampshire in fiction]]\n[[Category:Parker Brothers games]]\n[[Category:Roll-and-move board games]]\n", "name_user": "2603:9000:9509:b7f8:95e1:ce31:d8cd:9fdc", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Add sub)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo"}

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, but generally, most episodes feature four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, with the audience and panelists voting for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask to reveal their identity. This process of elimination continues for a set number of episodes until three contestants remain, and one is declared the winner after they perform again.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg and Thicke, respectively, due to their enthusiasm regarding the concept, and Scherzinger for her positivity and experience as a singer.<ref name=\"E!

Doyle cited the series as an example of a cultural shift in the United States away from the competitive and often exploitative nature of shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' towards a higher level of positivity among reality television series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=John|author-link=John Doyle (critic)|title=Dumb simplicity: Why ''The Masked Singer'' is a massive TV hit|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218163655/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|date=November 4, 2019|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Likewise, Daniel D'Addario of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the show as relaxing and refreshing, calling it a return to form for television as the series possesses the now-rare ability to uplift and unite people. He commended the show's panelists, comparing them to the original ''American Idol'' judges as non-experts in their fields due to their common, implausible [[A-list]] celebrity guesses. He also praised the show's platform for allowing celebrities to express themselves freely even if they are not professional singers.<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Addario|first=Daniel|title=In Praise of ''The Masked Singer'', TV's Last Uniter (Column)|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/columns/masked-singer-super-bowl-1203485315/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200210183913/https://variety.com/2020/tv/columns/masked-singer-super-bowl-1203485315/|archive-date=February 10, 2020|date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural impact===\nThe series is discussed on numerous [[podcast|podcasts]] and has generated its own [[Reddit#Subreddit|thread]] on [[Reddit]]<ref name=\"ATL Feb 28\"/> where avid fans of the show extensively analyze the clues presented during an episode in an attempt to decode them.<ref name=\"BB Jan 31\"/> The show was the first in the [[Masked Singer|''Masked Singer'' franchise]] to air outside of Asia and its success has been attributed to subsequent local adaptations. The producers of the [[The Masked Singer (British TV series)|British series]] said they were inspired to adapt the format after watching the American version.<ref name=\"THR Jan 2\"/><ref name=\"GH Feb 6\"/> Rob Wade, Fox network's President of  Alternative Entertainment and Specials, has described a shift in the way new shows are [[sales presentation|pitched]] since the series premiered, noting there is an increased openness to new ideas. Wade also said the heads of almost all television networks thanked him for the series giving them a \"[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]\" to take new programming risks.<ref name=\"VAR Feb 19\"/> \n\nMichael Schneider of ''Variety'' said the show's success has revitalized reality television in the United States. The revivals of ''[[Paradise Hotel]]'' and ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'' by Fox and [[USA Network]], respectively, have been credited to the show's success, as have the American adaptations of ''[[Love Island (American TV series)|Love Island]]'' and ''[[I Can See Your Voice (American game show)|I Can See Your Voice]]''.<ref name=\"VAR Feb 19\"/> The show has also been credited with reinvigorating the costume genre of television.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively.

{"title_page": "Italian city-states", "text_new": "{{History of Italy}}\n{{Original research|date=June 2019}}\nThe '''Italian city-states''' were a political phenomenon of small independent states mostly in the central and northern [[Italian Peninsula]] between the 9th and the 15th centuries. OOGA BOOGA\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], urban settlements in Italy generally enjoyed a greater continuity than in the rest of western [[Europe]]. Many of these towns were survivors of earlier [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], Umbrian and Roman towns which had existed within the Roman Empire. The republican institutions of Rome had also survived. Some [[feudal lord]]s existed with a servile labour force and huge tracts of land, but by the 11th century, many cities, including [[Venice]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], [[Lucca]], [[Cremona]], [[Siena]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Perugia]], and many others, had become large trading metropoles, able to obtain independence from their formal sovereigns.\n\n[[File:FirenzeIMG0281 bordercropped.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Florence]] was one of the most important city-states in [[Italy]]]]\n\n==Early Italian city-states==\nAmong the earliest city-states of Italy was the [[Duchy of Naples]], [[Duchy of Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]<ref>Naples from 661, Amalfi and Gaeta from 839, Venice about from 840 (''[[Pactum Lotharii]]''). The acquisition of Venice's independence began gradually; an important date was 742, when the [[Doge]] title was finally subtracted from the appointment of the Byzantine emperor).</ref><ref>Armando Lodolini, ''Le repubbliche del mare'', Roma, Biblioteca di storia patria, 1967.</ref> which, although nominally under Byzantine control, was effectively independent.\n\n===Communes===\nThe other first Italian city-states to appear in northern and central Italy arose as a result of a struggle to gain greater autonomy when not independent from the German [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.homolaicus.com/storia/medioevo/comune_medievale.htm Italian \"Comuni\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318214257/http://www.homolaicus.com/storia/medioevo/comune_medievale.htm |date=2012-03-18 }}</ref> The [[Lombard League]] was an alliance formed around at its apex included most of the cities of [[northern Italy]] including [[Milan]], [[Piacenza]], [[Cremona]], [[Mantua]], [[Crema, Italy|Crema]], [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], [[Bologna]], [[Padua]], [[Treviso]], [[Vicenza]], [[Verona]], [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], [[Reggio Emilia]] and [[Parma]], though its membership changed through time. Other city-states were associated to these ''\"commune\"'' cities, like [[Genoa]], [[Turin]] and, in central Italy, the city states of [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Ancona]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Perugia]], [[Assisi]] among others.\n\n===Duchies===\nSouth of [[Rome]] and the [[Papal States]] were the duchies of [[Duchy of Salerno|Salerno]], [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Naples]] and [[Duchy of Gaeta]]. Other independent cities were [[Bari]] and [[Trani]], which in 1130 were united in the newly created Norman [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref>Franco Cardini & Marina Montesano. ''Storia Medievale''. Le Monnier Universit\u00e0. Florence, 2006</ref>.\n\n===Maritime republics===\nAmalfi, Gaeta and Venice in the 11th century were already autonomous maritime republics. Around 1100, [[republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]] emerged as independent [[maritime republics]] too: trade, shipbuilding and banking helped support their powerful navies in the [[Mediterranean]] in those medieval centuries.<ref>G. Benvenuti ''Le Repubbliche Marinare. Amalfi, Pisa, Genova, Venezia''. Newton & Compton editori, Roma 1989; Armando Lodolini, ''Le repubbliche del mare'', Roma, Biblioteca di storia patria, 1967.</ref>. For them \u2013 nominally \u2013 the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was sovereign.\n\n==Difference from northern Europe==\nBetween the 12th and 13th centuries, Italy was vastly different from feudal [[Europe]] north of the [[Alps]]. The Peninsula was a [[wikt:melange|melange]] of political and cultural elements, not a unified state.\n\n[[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] have argued that geography determined the history of the region; other scholars emphasize the absence of central political structures. The very mountainous nature of Italy's landscape was a barrier to effective inter-city communication. The [[Po plain]], however, was an exception: it was the only large contiguous area, and most city states that fell to invasion were located there. Those that survived the longest were in the more rugged regions, such as Florence or Venice, which was protected by its lagoon. The rugged terrain of the Alps prevented the Holy Roman Emperors or various German princes and lords from attacking the northern part of Italy, safeguarding the country from permanent German political control. Largely for these reasons, no strong [[monarchy|monarchies]] emerged as they did in the rest of Europe: authority of the Holy Roman Empire over northern Italian territory, especially after the year 1177, was ''de facto'' only nominal; instead there emerged the autonomous (sometime ''de facto'' independent) [[city-state]]s.\n[[File:Venezianische Kolonien.png|thumbnail|The Most Serene [[Republic of Venice]] used to be a city-state, but then expanded and conquered several territories in mainland [[Italy]]\n (''[[Domini di Terraferma]]'') and abroad (''[[Stato da M\u00e0r]]'')]]\nWhile those Roman, urban, republican sensibilities persisted, there were many movements and changes afoot. Italy first felt the changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was:\n* a rise in population\u2015the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion)\n* an emergence of huge cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as [[Genoa]], [[Bologna]] and [[Verona]], which had over 50,000 inhabitants)\n* the rebuilding of the great cathedrals\n* substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)\n* an agrarian revolution\n* the development of commerce\n\nIn recent writing on the city states, American scholar [[Rodney Stark]] emphasizes that they married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism.<ref>Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005</ref>  He argues that these states were mostly republics, unlike the great European monarchies of France and Spain, where absolute power was vested in rulers who could and did stifle commerce.  Keeping both direct Church control and imperial power at arm's length, the independent city republics prospered through commerce based on early capitalist principles, ultimately creating the conditions for the artistic and intellectual changes produced by the [[Renaissance]].\n\nCambridge University historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner<ref>Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69</ref> has pointed out how [[Otto of Freising]], a German bishop who visited central Italy during the 12th century, commented that Italian towns had appeared to have exited from feudalism, so that their society was based on merchants and commerce. Even northern cities and states were also notable for their [[merchant republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]].<ref>Martin, J. and Romano, D., Venice Reconsidered, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000</ref>  Compared to absolutist monarchies or other more centrally controlled states, the Italian communes and commercial republics enjoyed relative political freedom conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Geographically, and because of trade, Italian cities such as Venice became international trading and banking hubs and intellectual crossroads.\n\nHarvard historian [[Niall Ferguson]]<ref>Ferguson, Niall, ''The Ascent of Money: The Financial History of the World''.  Penguin, 2008</ref> points out that Florence and Venice, as well as several other Italian city-states, played a crucial innovative role in world financial developments, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.\n\n==Income==\n\nIt is estimated that the per capita income of northern Italy nearly tripled from the 11th century to the 15th century. This was a highly mobile, demographically expanding society, fueled by rapidly expanding commerce.\n\nIn the 14th century, just as the Italian Renaissance was beginning, Italy was the economic capital of Western [[Europe]]: the Italian States were the top manufacturers of finished woolen products. However, with the [[Bubonic Plague]] in 1348, the birth of the English woolen industry, and general warfare, Italy temporarily lost its economic advantage. However, by the late 15th century Italy was again in control of trade along the Mediterranean Sea. It found a new niche in luxury items like ceramics, glassware, lace and silk as well as experiencing a temporary rebirth in the woolen industry.\n\nStill, Italy would never regain its strong hold on textiles. And though it was the birthplace of banking, by the 16th century German and Dutch banks began taking away business. Discovery of the [[Americas]] as well as new trade routes to [[Africa]] and [[India]] by the Portuguese (which made [[Portugal]] the leading trading power) brought about the shift of economic power from Italy<ref>Matthews and Platt. ''The Western Humanities''. Volume I: \"Beginnings through the Renaissance\".

More than one-third of the male population could read in the vernacular (an unprecedented rate since the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]]), as could a small but significant proportion of women.\n\nThe Italian city states were also highly numerate, given the importance of the new forms of [[bookkeeping]] that were essential to the trading and mercantile basis of society.

The civic culture which arose from this ''[[urbs]]'' was remarkable. In some places where communes arose (e.g. Britain and France), they were absorbed by the monarchical state as it emerged.  They survived in northern and central Italy as in a handful of other regions throughout Europe to become independent and powerful city-states. In Italy the breakaway from their feudal overlords occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the Pope and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]: [[Milan]] led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence ([[battle of Legnano|battles of Legnano]], 1176, and [[battle of Parma|Parma]], 1248; see [[Lombard League]]).\n\nSimilar town revolts led to the foundation of city-states throughout medieval Europe, such as in Russia ([[Novgorod Republic]], 12th century), in Flanders ([[Battle of Golden Spurs]], 14th century) in Switzerland (the towns of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], 14th century), in Germany (the [[Hanseatic League]], 14th\u201315th century), and in Prussia ([[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]], 15th century).\n\n\nSome Italian city-states became great military powers very early on. Venice and Genoa acquired vast naval empires in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, some of which threatened those of the growing Ottoman Empire.  During the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204), Venice conquered three-eights of the Byzantine Empire.\n[[Image:Italy 1494 shepherd.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Italian Peninsula in 1494, after the [[Peace of Lodi]]]]\n\nThe [[Maritime Republics]] were one of the main products of this new civic and social culture based on commerce and exchange of knowledge with other areas of the world outside western Europe. The [[Republic of Ragusa]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], for example, had important trade communications with the Muslim and Hindu world and this helped the initial development of the Italian [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the late 12th century, a new and remarkable society had emerged in Northern Italy; rich, mobile, expanding, with a mixed aristocracy and urban ''borghese'' ([[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]) class, interested in urban institutions and republican government. But many of the new city-states also housed violent factions based on family, confraternity and brotherhood, which undermined their cohesion (for instance the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]).\n\n==Princely states==\n\nBy 1300, most of these republics had become princely states dominated by a [[Signore]]. The exceptions were [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], and a few others, which remained republics in the face of an increasingly monarchic Europe. In many cases by 1400 the Signori were able to found a stable dynasty over their dominated city (or group of regional cities), obtaining also a nobility title of sovereignty by their formal superior, for example in 1395 [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] bought for 100,000 gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] the title of [[Duke of Milan]] from the emperor [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]].\n\n==Regional states==\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Florence]] were able to conquer other city-states, creating regional states. The 1454 [[Peace of Lodi]] ended their struggle for hegemony in Italy, attaining a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] (see [[Italian Renaissance]]).\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, apart from some minor city-states like [[Lucca]] or [[San Marino]], only the republican Venice was able to preserve its independence and to match the European monarchies of [[France]] and [[Spain]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Italian Wars]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Italy]]\n* [[Medieval commune]]\n* [[Repubbliche Marinare]]\n* [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n* [[Italian Renaissance]]\n* [[San Marino]]\n* [[Vatican City]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References and sources==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070603124424/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/REN/BACK.HTM \"Background to the Italian Renaissance\"], [[Washington State University]]\n* [http://www.arcaini.com/ITALY/ItalyHistory/ItalianCityStates.htm \"The Rise of the Italian City-States\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130722051231/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/c-states.html \"Italy's City-States\"], ''End of Europe's Middle Ages'', [[University of Calgary]]\n* [http://www.wga.hu/tours/gothic/history/city-sta.html \"City-states in Italy\"], [[Web Gallery of Art]]\n\n{{Italy topics}}\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Italian City-States}}\n[[Category:Italian city-states| ]]\n\n[[it:Citt\u00e0-stato italiane]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of Italy}}\n{{Original research|date=June 2019}}\nThe '''Italian city-states''' were a political phenomenon of small independent states mostly in the central and northern [[Italian Peninsula]] between the 9th and the 15th centuries.\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], urban settlements in Italy generally enjoyed a greater continuity than in the rest of western [[Europe]]. Many of these towns were survivors of earlier [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], Umbrian and Roman towns which had existed within the Roman Empire. The republican institutions of Rome had also survived. Some [[feudal lord]]s existed with a servile labour force and huge tracts of land, but by the 11th century, many cities, including [[Venice]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], [[Lucca]], [[Cremona]], [[Siena]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Perugia]], and many others, had become large trading metropoles, able to obtain independence from their formal sovereigns.\n\n[[File:FirenzeIMG0281 bordercropped.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Florence]] was one of the most important city-states in [[Italy]]]]\n\n==Early Italian city-states==\nAmong the earliest city-states of Italy was the [[Duchy of Naples]], [[Duchy of Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]<ref>Naples from 661, Amalfi and Gaeta from 839, Venice about from 840 (''[[Pactum Lotharii]]'').

Other city-states were associated to these ''\"commune\"'' cities, like [[Genoa]], [[Turin]] and, in central Italy, the city states of [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Ancona]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Perugia]], [[Assisi]] among others.\n\n===Duchies===\nSouth of [[Rome]] and the [[Papal States]] were the duchies of [[Duchy of Salerno|Salerno]], [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Naples]] and [[Duchy of Gaeta]]. Other independent cities were [[Bari]] and [[Trani]], which in 1130 were united in the newly created Norman [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref>Franco Cardini & Marina Montesano. ''Storia Medievale''. Le Monnier Universit\u00e0. Florence, 2006</ref>.\n\n===Maritime republics===\nAmalfi, Gaeta and Venice in the 11th century were already autonomous maritime republics. Around 1100, [[republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]] emerged as independent [[maritime republics]] too: trade, shipbuilding and banking helped support their powerful navies in the [[Mediterranean]] in those medieval centuries.<ref>G. Benvenuti ''Le Repubbliche Marinare. Amalfi, Pisa, Genova, Venezia''. Newton & Compton editori, Roma 1989; Armando Lodolini, ''Le repubbliche del mare'', Roma, Biblioteca di storia patria, 1967.</ref>. For them \u2013 nominally \u2013 the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was sovereign.\n\n==Difference from northern Europe==\nBetween the 12th and 13th centuries, Italy was vastly different from feudal [[Europe]] north of the [[Alps]]. The Peninsula was a [[wikt:melange|melange]] of political and cultural elements, not a unified state.\n\n[[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] have argued that geography determined the history of the region; other scholars emphasize the absence of central political structures. The very mountainous nature of Italy's landscape was a barrier to effective inter-city communication. The [[Po plain]], however, was an exception: it was the only large contiguous area, and most city states that fell to invasion were located there. Those that survived the longest were in the more rugged regions, such as Florence or Venice, which was protected by its lagoon. The rugged terrain of the Alps prevented the Holy Roman Emperors or various German princes and lords from attacking the northern part of Italy, safeguarding the country from permanent German political control. Largely for these reasons, no strong [[monarchy|monarchies]] emerged as they did in the rest of Europe: authority of the Holy Roman Empire over northern Italian territory, especially after the year 1177, was ''de facto'' only nominal; instead there emerged the autonomous (sometime ''de facto'' independent) [[city-state]]s.\n[[File:Venezianische Kolonien.png|thumbnail|The Most Serene [[Republic of Venice]] used to be a city-state, but then expanded and conquered several territories in mainland [[Italy]]\n (''[[Domini di Terraferma]]'') and abroad (''[[Stato da M\u00e0r]]'')]]\nWhile those Roman, urban, republican sensibilities persisted, there were many movements and changes afoot. Italy first felt the changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was:\n* a rise in population\u2015the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion)\n* an emergence of huge cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as [[Genoa]], [[Bologna]] and [[Verona]], which had over 50,000 inhabitants)\n* the rebuilding of the great cathedrals\n* substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)\n* an agrarian revolution\n* the development of commerce\n\nIn recent writing on the city states, American scholar [[Rodney Stark]] emphasizes that they married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism.<ref>Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005</ref>  He argues that these states were mostly republics, unlike the great European monarchies of France and Spain, where absolute power was vested in rulers who could and did stifle commerce.  Keeping both direct Church control and imperial power at arm's length, the independent city republics prospered through commerce based on early capitalist principles, ultimately creating the conditions for the artistic and intellectual changes produced by the [[Renaissance]].\n\nCambridge University historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner<ref>Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69</ref> has pointed out how [[Otto of Freising]], a German bishop who visited central Italy during the 12th century, commented that Italian towns had appeared to have exited from feudalism, so that their society was based on merchants and commerce. Even northern cities and states were also notable for their [[merchant republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]].<ref>Martin, J. and Romano, D., Venice Reconsidered, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000</ref>  Compared to absolutist monarchies or other more centrally controlled states, the Italian communes and commercial republics enjoyed relative political freedom conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Geographically, and because of trade, Italian cities such as Venice became international trading and banking hubs and intellectual crossroads.\n\nHarvard historian [[Niall Ferguson]]<ref>Ferguson, Niall, ''The Ascent of Money: The Financial History of the World''.  Penguin, 2008</ref> points out that Florence and Venice, as well as several other Italian city-states, played a crucial innovative role in world financial developments, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.\n\n==Income==\n\nIt is estimated that the per capita income of northern Italy nearly tripled from the 11th century to the 15th century. This was a highly mobile, demographically expanding society, fueled by rapidly expanding commerce.\n\nIn the 14th century, just as the Italian Renaissance was beginning, Italy was the economic capital of Western [[Europe]]: the Italian States were the top manufacturers of finished woolen products. However, with the [[Bubonic Plague]] in 1348, the birth of the English woolen industry, and general warfare, Italy temporarily lost its economic advantage. However, by the late 15th century Italy was again in control of trade along the Mediterranean Sea. It found a new niche in luxury items like ceramics, glassware, lace and silk as well as experiencing a temporary rebirth in the woolen industry.\n\nStill, Italy would never regain its strong hold on textiles. And though it was the birthplace of banking, by the 16th century German and Dutch banks began taking away business. Discovery of the [[Americas]] as well as new trade routes to [[Africa]] and [[India]] by the Portuguese (which made [[Portugal]] the leading trading power) brought about the shift of economic power from Italy<ref>Matthews and Platt.

Mountain View: Mayfield Publishing Co., 1992</ref> to Portugal in the 16th century, from Portugal to the Netherlands in the 17th century, and from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom in the 18th century.\n\n==Literacy and numeracy==\nBy the 13th century, northern and central Italy had become the most literate society in the world. More than one-third of the male population could read in the vernacular (an unprecedented rate since the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]]), as could a small but significant proportion of women.\n\nThe Italian city states were also highly numerate, given the importance of the new forms of [[bookkeeping]] that were essential to the trading and mercantile basis of society.
