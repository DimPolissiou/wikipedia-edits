R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and one of the main protagonists of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his uncle [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T/> Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 3, \"Three is Company\"</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 4, \"A Short Cut to Mushrooms\"</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 5, \"A Conspiracy Unmasked\"</ref>\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]].

The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 9, \"At the Sign of the Prancing Pony\"</ref> The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 10, \"Strider\"</ref>\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 12, \"Flight to the Ford\"</ref> Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 2, ch. 1, \"Many Meetings\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]].

As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light.

Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power.

Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring.

Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.<ref name=\"Flieger2001\">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |title=A Question of Time: J.R.R.

In drafts of the final chapters, published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>''[[The  Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"The Appendix on Languages\"</ref>\n\n==Interpretations== \n\nFrodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''. In a letter Tolkien states that it is the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', connected to ''[[Germanic name#Frod|fr\u00f3d]]'', \"wise by experience\".<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #168</ref> The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that the choice of name is significant: not, in Tolkien's phrase, one of the many \"names that had no meaning at all in [the hobbits'] daily language\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} Instead, he notes, the [[Old Norse]] name ''[[Fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' is mentioned in ''[[Beowulf]]'' as the minor character ''Fr\u00f3da''. ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \"peacemaker, indeed in the end a [[pacifist]]\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}}\n\nMichael Stanton, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', describes Frodo's character as combining \"courage, selflessness, and fidelity\",{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}} attributes that make Frodo ideal as a Ring-bearer. He lacks Sam's simple sturdiness, Merry and Pippin's clowning, and the [[psychopathology]] of Gollum, writes Stanton, bearing out the saying that good is less exciting than evil; but Frodo grows through his quest, becoming \"ennobled\" by it, to the extent that returning to the Shire feels in Frodo's words \"like falling asleep again\".{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}}\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Jane Chance]] quotes [[Randel Helms]]'s view that in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'', \"a most unheroic hobbit achieves heroic stature\" in a quest romance.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|pp=97-98}}{{sfn|Helms|1974|p=21}} Chance writes that Frodo grows from seeing the threat as external, such as from the Black Riders, to internal, whether within the Fellowship, as shown by Boromir's attempt on the Ring, or within himself, as he struggles against the controlling power of the Ring.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|p=99}}\n\nThe Tolkien critic [[Paul H. Kocher]] discusses the role of [[Divine providence|providence]], in the form of the intentions of the angel-like [[Valar]] or of the creator [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], in Bilbo's finding of the Ring and Frodo's bearing of it; as Gandalf says, Frodo was \"meant\" to have it, though it remains his choice to co-operate with this purpose.{{sfn|Kocher|1974|p=37}}\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Verlyn Flieger]] summarizes Frodo's role in ''Lord of the Rings'': \"The greatest hero of all, Frodo Baggins, is also the most tragic. He comes to the end of his story bereft of the Ring, denied in his home Shire the recognition he deserves, and unable to continue his life as it was before his terrible adventure.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger |title=An Unfinished Symphony |editor=Harold Bloom |work=J.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and one of the main protagonists of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T/> Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 3, \"Three is Company\"</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 4, \"A Short Cut to Mushrooms\"</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 5, \"A Conspiracy Unmasked\"</ref>\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]].

The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible.

The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 12, \"Flight to the Ford\"</ref> Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 2, ch. 1, \"Many Meetings\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]].

As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power.

Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring.

Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.<ref name=\"Flieger2001\">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |title=A Question of Time: J.R.R.

In drafts of the final chapters, published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>''[[The  Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"The Appendix on Languages\"</ref>\n\n==Interpretations== \n\nFrodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''.

''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \"peacemaker, indeed in the end a [[pacifist]]\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}}\n\nMichael Stanton, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', describes Frodo's character as combining \"courage, selflessness, and fidelity\",{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}} attributes that make Frodo ideal as a Ring-bearer. He lacks Sam's simple sturdiness, Merry and Pippin's clowning, and the [[psychopathology]] of Gollum, writes Stanton, bearing out the saying that good is less exciting than evil; but Frodo grows through his quest, becoming \"ennobled\" by it, to the extent that returning to the Shire feels in Frodo's words \"like falling asleep again\".{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}}\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Jane Chance]] quotes [[Randel Helms]]'s view that in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'', \"a most unheroic hobbit achieves heroic stature\" in a quest romance.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|pp=97-98}}{{sfn|Helms|1974|p=21}} Chance writes that Frodo grows from seeing the threat as external, such as from the Black Riders, to internal, whether within the Fellowship, as shown by Boromir's attempt on the Ring, or within himself, as he struggles against the controlling power of the Ring.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|p=99}}\n\nThe Tolkien critic [[Paul H. Kocher]] discusses the role of [[Divine providence|providence]], in the form of the intentions of the angel-like [[Valar]] or of the creator [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], in Bilbo's finding of the Ring and Frodo's bearing of it; as Gandalf says, Frodo was \"meant\" to have it, though it remains his choice to co-operate with this purpose.{{sfn|Kocher|1974|p=37}}\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Verlyn Flieger]] summarizes Frodo's role in ''Lord of the Rings'': \"The greatest hero of all, Frodo Baggins, is also the most tragic. He comes to the end of his story bereft of the Ring, denied in his home Shire the recognition he deserves, and unable to continue his life as it was before his terrible adventure.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger |title=An Unfinished Symphony |editor=Harold Bloom |work=J.
