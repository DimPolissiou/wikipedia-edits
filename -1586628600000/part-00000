His diaries of proceedings in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] are an important source for historians of parliamentary history during the period when he was a member, and [[J. E. Neale|Sir John Neale]] draws heavily upon them in his ground-breaking two-volume study of ''Elizabeth I and Her Parliaments'' (1953\u20131957).\n\n==Family==\nThomas Cromwell was the third son of [[Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell]] and [[Elizabeth Seymour, Baroness Cromwell|Elizabeth Seymour]], sister to [[Jane Seymour]], third wife of Henry VIII. He was the grandson of statesman [[Thomas Cromwell|Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex]], chief minister to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=8}} Born in around 1540, he was educated at St John's College, Cambridge where he matriculated in 1553.{{sfn|Venn|1922|p=423}}{{sfn|N. M. S.|1981}}\n\n== Career ==\nCromwell was a member of five successive Parliaments between 1571 and 1589 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. His constituencies included [[Fowey (UK Parliament constituency)|Fowey]] (1571), [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]] (1572\u20131581) and [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]] (1586-7 and 1588). Gregory Cromwell had been a friend of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Sir William Cecil]], who he described in his will as ''my especial and singular good lord,'' and it may have been Cecil who found  Thomas Cromwell his seats at Fowey, Bodmin and Grampound. His return at Preston in 1584 may be accounted for by the patronage of Sir [[Ralph Sadler]], chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who was brought up in the household of Cromwell\u2019s grandfather.{{sfn|N. M.

His sympathies were with the [[Puritan]] party in the House, but he was considered a moderate. Neale described him as ''the model type of parliamentarian, deeply versed in the history and procedure of the institution, though lacking in historical perspective; eminently responsible, but fearless in defence of liberty.'' He was a puritan but his zeal did not cloud his judgment which, with his knowledge of procedure, rendered him one of the most experienced committeemen of his time.{{sfn|N. M.

Neale|Sir John Neale]] draws heavily upon them in his ground-breaking two-volume study of ''Elizabeth I and Her Parliaments'' (1953\u20131957).\n\n==Family==\nThomas Cromwell was the third son of [[Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell]] and [[Elizabeth Seymour, Baroness Cromwell|Elizabeth Seymour]], sister to [[Jane Seymour]], third wife of Henry VIII.

Gregory Cromwell had been a friend of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Sir William Cecil]], who he described in his will as ''my especial and singular good lord,'' and it may have been Cecil who found  Thomas Cromwell his seats at Fowey, Bodmin and Grampound. His return at Preston in 1584 may be accounted for by the patronage of Sir [[Ralph Sadler]], chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who was brought up in the household of Cromwell\u2019s grandfather.{{sfn|N.

He was born in Highbury, London, in 1910, and was orphaned at an early age being brought up by his mother's friend, a nurse whom he regarded as an ''aunt''. After her marriage they moved to Brighton, bringing him in contact with the [[Royal Pavilion]], and a lifelong appreciation for architecture and design, and the Sea, where he learnt to swim and sail.

The Royal Navy and Ian Fleming==\nIn 1939 Robert Harling met [[Ian Fleming]], the meeting was (as Harling found later) no accident. Fleming, was serving in Naval Intelligence, and had heard about Harling's editorship of the Typography journal, which was setting new standards for the design and display of printed matter. During their meeting he learned that Harling was also writer and designer of \"News-Reel Maps\" for the News Chronicle, and \"demi-semi-resident art director\" of [[Thomas Cholmondeley, 4th Baron Delamere|Lord Delamere]]'s up-and-coming advertising agency. This led him to commission Harling to redesign the Admiralty's weekly intelligence report, but they were not to meet again until 1941.\n\nHarling, a keen amateur sailor, volunteered for the [[Royal Navy]]. Before he finished training, under the legendary Captain O.M. Watts, he found himself at Dunkirk in charge of a whaler. Sub-Lieutenant Harling, RNVR, next found himself navigator of a corvette, on convoy duty in the Western Approaches. This led him to write ''The Steep Atlantic Stream'', published by Chatto and Windus in 1946, based on his experiences in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean between 1941 and 1942.\n\nFollowing a meeting in London in 1941 Fleming recruited Harling to work in the [[Inter-Services Topographic Department|Inter-Service Topographical Department]] (ISTD), where he put him to work examining photographs of enemy held terrain and applying the knowledge he had gained researching maps for the News Chronicle. This led to an adventurous air-trip to various parts of the world to collect data.\n\nOn forming [[No. 30 Commando|30AU (30 Assault Unit)]] Fleming again tapped Harling. Landing soon after D-Day, he pursued the task assigned to the unit to pick up enemy code-books, security documents and wireless equipment through fierce fighting round Cherbourg, and on into France. Cautious, eventually cordial relations with American forces brought a memorable meeting with General George Patton, which was followed by a lightning dash across Germany to Magdeburg to round up German scientists. A final mission to Norway to disarm German naval forces brought a close to Harling's war.\n\n==Immediate Post-War Career==\nIn between convoy duty and the ISTD Harling had redesigned the ailing [[Daily Sketch]] for [[Viscount Kemsley|Lord Kemsley]], who liked Harling's work but thought it too advanced. He now invited Harling to become typographical adviser to [[The Sunday Times]], where his friend Fleming had become Foreign News Manager. With his old friend James Shand, printer and sponsor of Typography, he launched a new journal, Alphabet and Image (1946\u201348), which later became Image (1949\u201352). He was also given a larger room in the Delamere advertising agency, and was a consultant to [[The Financial Times]] and in 1947 redesigned ''Time and Tide'' for [[Margaret Mackworth, 2nd Viscountess Rhondda|Lady Rhondda]].\n\nHarling now turned his hand to writing a number of popular 'pulp fiction' titles including: The Paper Palace (1951), The Dark Saviour (1952), The Enormous Shadow (1955), The Endless Colonnade (1958), The Hollow Sunday (1967), The Athenian Widow (1974) and finally The Summer Portrait (1979). He wrote easily and well, with a good ear for dialogue.\n\nFleming, too, had taken to thrillers, and their friendship continued to increase during the period, despite [[James Bond|Bond]] taking over his creator's life to an alarming extent. In 1957 Fleming was about to go to New York, when Harling suggested that he might sound out \"Pat\" (Iva Patcevitch), the head of Cond\u00e9 Nast, about the editorship of House & Garden. Fleming was astounded that his friend Harling wanted the job, but did what he was asked, and the deal was done surprisingly quickly.\n\n==House & Garden==\n\nHarling now established a new routine, four days at [[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]], and Friday and Saturday at [[The Sunday Times]], where he was architectural correspondent as well as designer (and from 1961 he would become Editor of the [[Sunday Telegraph]]).\n\nAt ''House and Garden'' he had a staff of 18 which included [[Leonie Highton]], and later John Bridges, and three outstanding advisers: Elizabeth David (on food), Loelia, Duchess of Westminster (to discover unknown houses), and Olive Sullivan (on interior design). With his dedicated and happy crew he revitalised House & Garden, and produced a Magazine in Britain which would contrast the ancient and modern, colour and simplicity.\n\nBesides the magazine, he launched a series of books on the same theme, starting in 1959 with House & Garden Interiors and Colour. Ten more books followed, his last contributions being the House & Garden Book of Romantic Rooms (1985), and House & Garden Book of Classic Rooms (1989); in 1980 with Miles Hadfield he published British Gardeners: a biographical dictionary \u2013 this being a reworking of ''Pioneers in Gardening'' a book which he had developed with Miles Hadfield and Leonie Highton thirty five years earlier.\n\n==Later life==\n\nHarling would admit that some of the fun of life diminished following the death of his friend Fleming in 1964, but he remained alert and active, and could still be found at [[The Sunday Times]] late on Saturday evenings until 1985. Nor did his interest in the graphic arts wain. His publication ''The Letter-forms and Type-designs of Eric Gill'' (1976) is still considered the best assessment of Gill's work, which perhaps is no surprise given Harling was also a master of lettering. He also contributed his memories to The Wood-engravings of Tirzah Ravilious (1987).\n\nHarling's greatest legacy to Printing and Publishing can probably be summed up as his generous approach to helping younger designers, editors and authors in understanding the ''Harling style'', many of whom he has outlived. If the style itself has changed, the Harling message of clarity, simplicity, and economy etc., has not.\n\nRobert Henry Harling, typographer, graphic artist and designer, editor and novelist: born London 27 March 1910. Married Phoebe Konstam (who predeceased him in 2006) in April 1945, having met at the Gargoyle Club. They had two sons and a daughter, and set up home at an old house in Suffolk, before moving to an 18th-century Gothic vicarage on the Kent-Sussex border in 1953, which was made more picturesque by the removal of a later top floor.

United States: Checkmark.</ref>\n\nAccording to a pair of articles by Professor Gerald Cohen and Robert Scott Ross published in ''Comments on Etymology'' (2008), supported by etymologist [[Michael Quinion]] and accepted by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the idiom did not originate from a hunting practice.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /> Ross researched the origin of the story and found the earliest reference to using herrings for training animals was in a tract on horsemanship published in 1697 by Gerland Langbaine.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /> Langbaine recommended a method of training horses (not hounds) by dragging the carcass of a cat or fox so that the horse would be accustomed to following the chaos of a hunting party.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /> He says if a dead animal is not available, a red herring would do as a substitute.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /> This recommendation was misunderstood by Nicholas Cox, published in the notes of another book around the same time, who said it should be used to train hounds (not horses).<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /> Either way, the herring was not used to distract the hounds or horses from a trail, rather to guide them along it.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" />\n\nThe earliest reference to using herring for distracting hounds is an article published on 14 February 1807 by radical journalist [[William Cobbett]] in his polemical periodical ''[[Political Register]]''.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /><ref>\"Red herring\", [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Sense 2.</ref><ref name=\"cobbett\">\"...we used, in order to draw oft' the harriers from the trail of a hare that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches...\" For the full original story by Cobbett, see [https://archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb#page/116/mode/2up \"Continental War\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629152657/http://www.archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-06-29 }} on pg. 231\u2013233 of ''Political Register'', February 14, 1807. In [https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb ''Cobbett's political register, Volume XI, 1807''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803231251/https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-08-03 }} at [[Internet Archive]]</ref> According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is the origin of the figurative meaning of red herring.<ref name=\"quinion2002\" /> In the piece, William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat.
