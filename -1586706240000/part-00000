During the tournament, discussion-based sessions called ''Physics Fights'' are conducted and the performances of the teams are judged by expert physicists.\n\nThe IYPT is a week-long event in which currently around 150 international pre-university contestants participate. The participants present and discuss their research projects at the events that share common features with thesis defense or scientific conferences. The teams switch roles and take floor as Reporters, Opponents and Reviewers, thus learning about [[peer review]] early on in their school years.\n\nThe concept was conceived in 1979 by Evgeny Yunosov and was run as the [[Russian Young Physicists' Tournament]], an event localised to Russia.  He went on to initiate the first IYPT in 1988.\n\n== Timeline table ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!No.\n!Venue\n!Host country\n!No. of<br />teams\n!No. of<br />countries\n!Gold winner(s)\n!Silver

During the tournament, discussion-based sessions called ''Physics Fights'' are conducted and the performances of the teams are judged by expert physicists.\n\nThe IYPT is a week-long event in which currently around 150 international pre-university contestants participate. The participants present and discuss their research projects at the events that share common features with thesis defense or scientific conferences. The teams switch roles and take floor as Reporters, Opponents and Reviewers, thus learning about [[peer review]] early on in their school years.\n\nThe concept was conceived in 1979 by Evgeny Yunosov and was run as the [[Russian Young Physicists' Tournament]], an event localised to Russia.  He went on to initiate the first IYPT in 1988.\n\n== Timeline table ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!No.\n!Venue\n!Host country\n!No. of<br />teams\n!No. of<br />countries\n!Gold winner(s)\n!Silver

Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a [[lamasery]], enclosed in the western end of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan [[utopia]] \u2013 a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of the [[Orientalism|Orient]].\n\nIn the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.<ref name=\"National Park brochure\">{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra\n|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park & Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}</ref> Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe phrase \"Shangri-La\" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|\u0f5e\u0f44\u0f0b}}'',\"Shang\" \u2013 a district of [[\u00dc-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]<ref>Chandra Das \u2013 Tibetan English Dictionary</ref>\" + ''{{lang|bo|\u0f62\u0f72}}'', pronounced \"ri\", \"Mountain\" = \"Shang Mountain\" + ''{{lang|bo|\u0f63}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, \"Shang Mountain Pass\".\n\nSome scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.<ref name=\"LePage_1977\">{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url=}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nAcademic scholars believe they have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.<ref>Bishop, Peter (1989).

However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a ''[[New York Times]]'' gossip column in which he reveals that his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La, if it is any place, is more than 250&nbsp;km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.<ref name=\"McRae\"/><ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nBetween 2002\u20132004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton's book ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' was based on references to northern [[Yunnan]] Province from articles published by National Geographic's first resident explorer [[Joseph Rock]].<ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/>\n\nOn 2&nbsp;December 2010, [[OPB]] televised one of [[Martin Yan]]'s ''[[Hidden China]]'' episodes, \"Life in Shangri-La\", in which Yan said that \"Shangri-La\" is the actual name of a [[Shangri-La County|real town]] in the hilly and mountainous region in northwestern [[Yunnan]] Province, frequented by both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops and local farmers as they harvested crops, and sampled their cuisine.\n\nTelevision presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the \"Shangri-La\" episode of the BBC documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggests that the legendary Shangri-La is the abandoned city of [[Tsaparang]] in upper [[Satluj]] valley, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.\n\nThe Travel Channel in 2016 aired two episodes of ''Expedition Unknown'' that followed host Josh Gates to Nepal and its surrounding areas, including the sky caves found there, in search of Shangri-La. His findings offer no proof that Shangri-La is or was real.\n\n==Usage==\nShangri-La is often used in a context similar to \"[[Garden of Eden]],\" to represent a paradise hidden from modern man. It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive but much sought; for a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's \"Shangri-La.\" It also might be used to represent a sought-for perfection in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of similar metaphors such as [[El Dorado]], [[The Fountain of Youth]], and [[The Holy Grail]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|date=January 2020}}\nThere are a number of cultural usages of the Shangri-La idea that have developed since 1933 in the wake of the novel and the film made from it.\n\n=== World War II ===\nAn unusual consequence of the [[Doolittle Raid]] of 1942 came after, when (in the interests of secrecy) President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] answered a reporter's question by saying that the raid had been launched from \"Shangri-La\".<ref> See [[Camp David]]</ref> The true details of the raid were revealed to the public one year later, in April 1943.<ref>[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1943/04/20/One-year-later-Tokyo-raid-story-told/8761134802538/ \"One year later, Tokyo raid story told\"].

The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of the [[Orientalism|Orient]].\n\nIn the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.<ref name=\"National Park brochure\">{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra\n|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park & Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}</ref> Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe phrase \"Shangri-La\" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|\u0f5e\u0f44\u0f0b}}'',\"Shang\" \u2013 a district of [[\u00dc-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]<ref>Chandra Das \u2013 Tibetan English Dictionary</ref>\" + ''{{lang|bo|\u0f62\u0f72}}'', pronounced \"ri\", \"Mountain\" = \"Shang Mountain\" + ''{{lang|bo|\u0f63}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, \"Shang Mountain Pass\".\n\nSome scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.<ref name=\"LePage_1977\">{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url=}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nAcademic scholars believe they have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.<ref>Bishop, Peter (1989).

It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive but much sought; for a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's \"Shangri-La.\" It also might be used to represent a sought-for perfection in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals.
