Taylor's characters were adopted during this season's production cycle by voice actress [[Grey Griffin]] starting with the episode \"[[Marge the Lumberjill]]\", though the last episode to feature Taylor would be \"Thanksgiving of Horror\" which aired afterwards due to being part of the [[The Simpsons (season 30)|prior season]]'s production run that was deliberately scheduled to air close to [[Thanksgiving]] 2019. \n\n==Accolades==\nIn early December 2019 it was announced that three episodes had been nominated for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation|Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation]] for the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2019|72nd Writers Guild of America Awards]], resulting in ''The Simpsons'' having the most nominations overall that year.

Comedian and writer [[Pete Holmes]] also both wrote and guest starred in the two-part \"[[Warrin' Priests]]\" episodes, making him the third freelance writer to do so after [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Seth Rogen]]. While in \"Warrin' Priests\" Holmes plays the character of Bode, he had previously guest starred in season 30 premiere \"[[Bart's Not Dead]]\" as a different character. The episode \"[[The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby]]\" was delayed from the previous season, with the original intent to air it instead of \"[[I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh]]\" on April 7, 2019. The episode was put on hold after the show's producers decided to make a short film related to the episode involving Maggie and another baby named Hudson titled ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'' as well. The short film premiered on February 29, 2020, attached to advanced screenings of the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] release ''[[Onward (film)|Onward]]'' with \"The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby\" serving as a sequel to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/the-simpsons-short-playdate-with-destiny-onward-origins/|title=Exclusive: The story behind the secret ''Simpsons'' short heading to theaters|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis season was produced and aired during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] which delayed or canceled the production of many television productions, but as an animated production this took less of a toll on the show than most live-action productions. Executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] encouraged the staff to begin working from their homes in early March 2020, before California's [[stay-at-home order]] was declared. In an interview with [[The Hollywood Reporter]] in late March 2020 Al Jean stated, \"Production hasn't skipped a day or lost a beat. We intend to do the 22 shows we were contracted to do... There's been no change in how we do things.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/animated-series-adapt-keep-production-going-industry-wide-shutdown-1286340|title=Animated Series Adapt to Keep Production Going Amid Industry-Wide Shutdown|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2020 the show joined the rest of FOX's [[Animation Domination]] lineup in a partnership with [[Caffeine (service)|Caffeine]] for the ''AniDom Beyond Show'', a recap show hosted by [[Andy Richter]]. The hour-long program featured interviews with guests and live interactivity with fans online, with recaps for the episodes that aired through April and May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/04/16/fox-entertainment-and-caffeine-to-partner-on-live-sunday-night-animation-domination-branded-series-the-anidom-beyond-show-hosted-by-andy-richter-638015/20200416fox01/|title=FOX Entertainment and Caffeine to Partner on Live Sunday Night \"Animation Domination\"-Branded Series the \"AniDom Beyond Show,\" Hosted by Andy Richter||work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIt was during the run of this season that longtime voice actor [[Hank Azaria]] announced that he was officially stepping down from voicing [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], a character he had played since the episode \"[[The Telltale Head]]\" from the first season. The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the [[Hari Kondabolu]] documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'' released in 2017. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too [[politically correct]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|season 29]] episode \"[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore, unless there's someway to transition it or something.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/apu-voice-actor/|title='The Simpsons' Star Hank Azaria Will No Longer Voice Apu [TCA 2020]|work=SlashFilm|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of The Simpsons episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main\n|background = #3901A4 \n|overall    = \n|season     = \n|title      = \n|titleR     = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/simpsons/listings/|title=''The Simpsons'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n|director   = \n|writer     = \n|airdate    = \n|airdateR   = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\" />\n|prodcode   = \n|viewers    = \n|country    = U.S.\n|episodes   = \n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|The Simpsons (season 31)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 663\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[The Winter of Our Monetized Content]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Ryan Koh]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|29}}\n |ProdCode        = YABF19\n |Viewers         = 2.33<ref name=\"31.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-sept-29-2019/|title='60 Minutes,' 'NCIS: Los Angeles,' and 'Sunday Night Football' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary    = [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become viral video stars.

[[Matt Selman]] also contributed as showrunner for the episodes \"[[Go Big or Go Homer]]\", \"[[Livin' la Pura Vida]]\", \"[[Thanksgiving of Horror]]\", \"[[The Miseducation of Lisa Simpson]]\", \"[[Bart the Bad Guy]]\" and \"[[Highway to Well]]\".\n\nIt is the last season to feature the voice talents of recurring co-star [[Russi Taylor]] who died on July 26, 2019 and had been with the show since the very [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] voicing characters such as [[Martin Prince]], [[Sherri and Terri]] and [[Uter|\u00dcter Z\u00f6rker]]. Taylor's characters were adopted during this season's production cycle by voice actress [[Grey Griffin]] starting with the episode \"[[Marge the Lumberjill]]\", though the last episode to feature Taylor would be \"Thanksgiving of Horror\" which aired afterwards due to being part of the [[The Simpsons (season 30)|prior season]]'s production run that was deliberately scheduled to air close to [[Thanksgiving]] 2019. \n\n==Accolades==\nIn early December 2019 it was announced that three episodes had been nominated for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation|Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation]] for the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2019|72nd Writers Guild of America Awards]], resulting in ''The Simpsons'' having the most nominations overall that year.

Comedian and writer [[Pete Holmes]] also both wrote and guest starred in the two-part \"[[Warrin' Priests]]\" episodes, making him the third freelance writer to do so after [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Seth Rogen]]. While in \"Warrin' Priests\" Holmes plays the character of Bode, he had previously guest starred in season 30 premiere \"[[Bart's Not Dead]]\" as a different character. The episode \"[[The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby]]\" was delayed from the previous season, with the original intent to air it instead of \"[[I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh]]\" on April 7, 2019. The episode was put on hold after the show's producers decided to make a short film related to the episode involving Maggie and another baby named Hudson titled ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'' as well. The short film premiered on February 29, 2020, attached to advanced screenings of the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] release ''[[Onward (film)|Onward]]'' with \"The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby\" serving as a sequel to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/the-simpsons-short-playdate-with-destiny-onward-origins/|title=Exclusive: The story behind the secret ''Simpsons'' short heading to theaters|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis season was produced and aired during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] which delayed or canceled the production of many television productions, but as an animated production this took less of a toll on the show than most live-action productions. Executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] encouraged the staff to begin working from their homes in early March 2020, before California's [[stay-at-home order]] was declared. In an interview with [[The Hollywood Reporter]] in late March 2020 Al Jean stated, \"Production hasn't skipped a day or lost a beat. We intend to do the 22 shows we were contracted to do... There's been no change in how we do things.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/animated-series-adapt-keep-production-going-industry-wide-shutdown-1286340|title=Animated Series Adapt to Keep Production Going Amid Industry-Wide Shutdown|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=February April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2020 the show joined the rest of FOX's [[Animation Domination]] lineup in a partnership with [[Caffeine (service)|Caffeine]] for the ''AniDom Beyond Show'', a recap show hosted by [[Andy Richter]]. The hour-long program featured interviews with guests and live interactivity with fans online, with recaps for the episodes that aired through April and May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/04/16/fox-entertainment-and-caffeine-to-partner-on-live-sunday-night-animation-domination-branded-series-the-anidom-beyond-show-hosted-by-andy-richter-638015/20200416fox01/|title=FOX Entertainment and Caffeine to Partner on Live Sunday Night \"Animation Domination\"-Branded Series the \"AniDom Beyond Show,\" Hosted by Andy Richter||work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=February April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIt was during the run of this season that longtime voice actor [[Hank Azaria]] announced that he was officially stepping down from voicing [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], a character he had played since the episode \"[[The Telltale Head]]\" from the first season. The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the [[Hari Kondabolu]] documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'' released in 2017. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too [[politically correct]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|season 29]] episode \"[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore, unless there's someway to transition it or something.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/apu-voice-actor/|title='The Simpsons' Star Hank Azaria Will No Longer Voice Apu [TCA 2020]|work=SlashFilm|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of The Simpsons episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main\n|background = #3901A4 \n|overall    = \n|season     = \n|title      = \n|titleR     = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/simpsons/listings/|title=''The Simpsons'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n|director   = \n|writer     = \n|airdate    = \n|airdateR   = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\" />\n|prodcode   = \n|viewers    = \n|country    = U.S.\n|episodes   = \n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|The Simpsons (season 31)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 663\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[The Winter of Our Monetized Content]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Ryan Koh]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|29}}\n |ProdCode        = YABF19\n |Viewers         = 2.33<ref name=\"31.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-sept-29-2019/|title='60 Minutes,' 'NCIS: Los Angeles,' and 'Sunday Night Football' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary    = [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become viral video stars.

There are seven unique realms to visit, and each one is themed around a different stage of life. In addition to these realms, there is a Home that serves as a hub between the different realms. Throughout the game, the player will encounter \"spirits\" that give the player cosmetic and gameplay-affecting items in return for in-game currency. The player can also find \"lost stars\" that give the player \"winged light\". When the player has collected enough winged light, their cape level goes up, increasing their maximum \"wing energy\" and allowing them to fly farther. \n\nThe game features a heavy focus on social mechanics. Players are able to meet and befriend one another, and can unlock new abilities such as chat and sending gifts as their friendship grows. There are also many cosmetic items to collect including capes, masks, hairstyles, hats, pants, playable [[Musical instrument|musical instruments]], expressions, and more. These items can be obtained using in-game currency.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 81/100<ref name=MCiOS>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/sky-children-of-the-light |title=Sky: Children of the Light for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n| IGN= iOS: 8.5/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/20/sky-children-of-the-light-review |title=Sky: Children of the Light Review. |last=Jagneaux|first=David|date=20 July 2019 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=8  April 2020}}</ref>\n| GI= iOS: 8.25/10<ref name=\"GI Review\">{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Matt |title=Sky: Children Of The Light Review \u2013 The Next Logical Leap |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/sky-children-of-the-light/the-next-logical-leap |website=Game Informer |accessdate=8 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n| GSpot= iOS: 8/10<ref name=\"GSpot Review\">{{cite web |last1=Barbosa |first1=Alessandro |title=Sky: Children Of The Light Review - Flying Free |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sky-children-of-the-light-review-flying-free/1900-6417262/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n| PG = iOS: {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sullivan |first1=Dann |title=Sky: Children of the Light review - \"Transcends the standards of the platformer genre\" |url=https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/080718/sky-children-of-the-light-review/ |website=Pocketgamer |accessdate=12 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Metacritic]] awarded the game an 81 out of 100 with 17 reviewers, as well as awarding it the number one shared iOS game of 2019, number five most discussed iOS game of 2019, and number 12 best iOS game of 2019.<ref name=MCiOS/> [[Gameinformer]] scored the game a 8.5 out of 10 stating \"''Sky'' is a refreshingly moving and robust game on the iOS platform, and one best shared with others \u2013 especially folks who might not normally pick up a video game.\"<ref name=\"GI Review\"/> [[Gamespot]] scored the game a 8 out of 10, giving exceptional praise to the visuals, animations and musical scores, however admitting that \"return visits to previous environments aren't nearly as captivating as your first trip\".<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> [[IGN]] scored the game a 8.5 out of 10, likening the game to its predecessor as \"a bigger and bolder follow-up that expands on what made Journey so great.\"<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> [[Destructoid]], like many other reviewers praised how it's a game that \"most everyone should experience\", was however highly critical of the touch controls and the lack of control it gave of your character, going as far to suggest that \"most everyone should wait for a console or PC release\" to play the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: Sky: Children of the Light |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-sky-children-of-the-light-561952.phtml |website=Destructoid |accessdate=15 April 2020 |language=english}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe game won [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s iPhone game of the year for 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple celebrates the best apps and games of 2019 |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/12/apple-celebrates-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2019/ |website=[[Apple Newsroom]] |date=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

There are seven unique realms to visit, and each one is themed around a different stage of life. In addition to these realms, there is a Home that serves as a hub between the different realms. Throughout the game, the player will encounter \"spirits\" that give the player cosmetic and gameplay-affecting items in return for in-game currency. The player can also find \"lost stars\" that give the player \"winged light\". When the player has collected enough winged light, their cape level goes up, increasing their maximum \"wing energy\" and allowing them to fly farther. \n\nThe game features a heavy focus on social mechanics. Players are able to meet and befriend one another, and can unlock new abilities such as chat and sending gifts as their friendship grows. There are also many cosmetic items to collect including capes, masks, hairstyles, hats, pants, playable [[Musical instrument|musical instruments]], expressions, and more. These items can be obtained using in-game currency.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 81/100<ref name=MCiOS>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/sky-children-of-the-light |title=Sky: Children of the Light for iPhone/iPad Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 04, 2020}}</ref>\n| IGN= iOS: 8.5/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/20/sky-children-of-the-light-review |title=Sky: Children of the Light Review. |last=Jagneaux|first=David|date=20 July 2019 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=8  April 2020}}</ref>\n| GI= iOS: 8.25/10<ref name=\"GI Review\">{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Matt |title=Sky: Children Of The Light Review \u2013 The Next Logical Leap |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/sky-children-of-the-light/the-next-logical-leap |website=Game Informer |accessdate=8 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n| GSpot= iOS: 8/10<ref name=\"GSpot Review\">{{cite web |last1=Barbosa |first1=Alessandro |title=Sky: Children Of The Light Review - Flying Free |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sky-children-of-the-light-review-flying-free/1900-6417262/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n| PG = iOS: {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sullivan |first1=Dann |title=Sky: Children of the Light review - \"Transcends the standards of the platformer genre\" |url=https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/080718/sky-children-of-the-light-review/ |website=Pocketgamer |accessdate=12 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Metacritic]] awarded the game an 81 out of 100 with 17 reviewers, as well as awarding it the number one shared iOS game of 2019, number five most discussed iOS game of 2019, and number 12 best iOS game of 2019.<ref name=MCiOS/> [[Gameinformer]] scored the game a 8.5 out of 10 stating \"''Sky'' is a refreshingly moving and robust game on the iOS platform, and one best shared with others \u2013 especially folks who might not normally pick up a video game.\"<ref name=\"GI Review\"/> [[Gamespot]] scored the game a 8 out of 10, giving exceptional praise to the visuals, animations and musical scores, however admitting that \"return visits to previous environments aren't nearly as captivating as your first trip\".<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> [[IGN]] scored the game a 8.5 out of 10, likening the game to its predecessor as \"a bigger and bolder follow-up that expands on what made Journey so great.\"<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> [[Destructoid]], like many other reviewers praised how it's a game that \"most everyone should experience\", was however highly critical of the touch controls and the lack of control it gave of your character, going as far to suggest that \"most everyone should wait for a console or PC release\" to play the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: Sky: Children of the Light |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-sky-children-of-the-light-561952.phtml |website=Destructoid |accessdate=15 April 2020 |language=english}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe game won [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s iPhone game of the year for 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple celebrates the best apps and games of 2019 |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/12/apple-celebrates-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2019/ |website=[[Apple Newsroom]] |date=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It was Pitt's first major role.\n\nThe film was released [[direct-to-video]] by [[Republic Pictures]] on July 17, 1989.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe plot revolves around the return of Brian Woods, a \"problem teen\". He has just been released from a mental hospital; he was admitted after the suspicious death of his father, who crashed and died while driving a car with cut brakes. He falls in love with his classmate, Paula Carson, but the local basketball star, Dwight Ingalls, is already Paula's boyfriend. Meanwhile, the lecherous school principal also seeks Paula's affections. Then horrible murders start happening with no one certain of the identity of the culprit. The main suspects are Dwight, whose control of his anger has never been perfect; Woods, who may not have been fully cured at the sanitarium; and the principal, who seems to stop at nothing in his attempts to sleep with Paula.\n\nThe film opens with a paperboy delivering newspapers. A paper is delivered to Paula Carson's house. Paula is approached by her father, Bill, who is the district attorney, who has planned a hunting trip. He warns Paula to do her homework, not to allow boys in the house, and most importantly not to cut class. Paula then puts the newspaper in the bin, showing its headline: \"Boy who killed father released from Mental Asylum.\"\n\nBill Carson drives to the swamps for his hunting trip. As he takes shots into the air, someone is hiding nearby and holding a bow and arrows. The person calls over to Bill Carson and fires an arrow into him. Bill cries out and then falls down to the ground. Throughout the rest of the movie, there are cuts to Bill struggling to get help (including asking a dog to yell for help) as well as crawl his way back home.\n\nMeanwhile, Dwight Ingalls enters class late after avoiding two accidents on his ride to school. Dwight is questioned by his teacher, Mr. Conklin, and a boy sitting next to Dwight whispers the answers to him. Dwight tells him to shut up when he teases Dwight for not knowing what H2O is.\n\nLater, Colleen and Paula are taking out gym equipment. Paula walks past a set of bow and arrows and notices a leaf hanging off one of the arrow. Paula picks the leaf off. Meanwhile, Brian is told to climb a rope by the P.E. coach, but Dwight caused him to fall.\n\nAt a hot dog stand, Colleen, Paula, and Gary are waiting for Dwight. Brian approaches, and Colleen insults him before asserting that Brian has a crush on Paula. Dwight then pulls up in his car and starts talking to Paula. He asks her to go to her house, as her father is away, which would give them the opportunity to be alone. Dwight then goes to buy Paula a hot dog, but he is beaten by Brian who hands her one and says, \"You had that look.\" When Dwight returns, he tells Paula to get in the car and makes it clear to Brian that they are not friends anymore and to leave him and Paula alone. They all then drive off in Dwight's car.\n\nBrian and Paula nevertheless become friends, and she starts to trust him. Dwight warns her to stay away from him. A teacher is murdered in the copyroom, and the students notice that the killer made copies of the killing on the copy machine. The teacher's face is shown smashed into the copy machine glass along with a ring on the killer's finger. The ring belongs to Dwight. Soon they think that Dwight (Brad Pitt) is the killer instead of Brian.\n\nBrian tries to kill Paula, Dwight, and a math teacher in the school, and the janitor happens to be around at the time. Every classroom they run into, Brian starts talking to Paula and the math teacher through the PA in the principal's office. Paula still thinks that Dwight is the killer, and she is still running from him. Soon Brian goes into the classroom after hacking the math teacher to death. Dwight enters and gets Brian off of Paula, and they run out to the shop class and hide after Brian exclaims, \"YOU'RE A YANKEE DOODLE DANDY TOO; YOU TWO MUST KILL OR DIE!\" Brian knows they are in there, so he follows them while locking them in and turning on all the equipment.\n\nBrian corners Dwight and puts his head in a vice and points a drill towards his face. Paula ends up striking Brian in the head with a claw hammer, making him fall onto a moving circular saw, which goes right through his torso as Paula rescues Dwight. They leave the school and are in Dwight's car when, all of a sudden, they see Paula's dad as he is falling down the hill into the road. Paula points out that it is her dad, but Dwight cannot stop because Brian cut the brakes earlier. They swerve and miss hitting Paula's dad. All he says is, \"Shouldn't you be in school? You're not cutting class, I hope!\" The movie ends with the camera's freezing on Paula's face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=45em}}\n\n*[[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] as Brian Woods\n*[[Jill Schoelen]] as Paula Carson\n*[[Brad Pitt]] as Dwight Ingalls\n*[[Roddy McDowall]] as Mr. Dante\n*[[Martin Mull]] as William Carson III\n*Brenda James as Colleen (as Brenda Lynn Klemme)\n*Mark Barnet as Gary\n*[[Tom Ligon]] as Mr. Ingalls\n*[[Robert Glaudini]] as Shultz\n*Eric Boles as Mr. Glynn\n*[[Dirk Blocker]] as Coach Harris\n*Nancy Fish as Mrs. Knocht\n*Robert Machray as Mr. Conklin\n*[[David Clarke (actor)|David Clarke]] as Crusty Old Man\n*[[Norman Alden]] as Officer Fondulac\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe movie was received negatively by critics.
