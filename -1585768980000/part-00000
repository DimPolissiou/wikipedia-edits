He was an eight-time [[NBA All-Star]] and a seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection. Twice, Nash was named the [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the [[Phoenix Suns]]. He currently serves as senior advisor of the [[Canada men's national basketball team|Canadian men's national team]] and as a player development consultant for the [[Golden State Warriors]].\n\nAfter a successful [[high school]] basketball career in [[British Columbia]], Nash earned a scholarship to [[Santa Clara University]] in California. In his four seasons with the [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|Broncos]], the team made three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, and he was twice named the [[West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|West Coast Conference (WCC) Player of the Year]]. Nash graduated from Santa Clara as the team's all-time leader in [[assist (basketball)|assists]] and was taken as the 15th pick in the [[1996 NBA draft]] by the [[Phoenix Suns]]. He made minimal impact and was traded to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in 1998. By his fourth season with the Mavericks, he was voted to his first [[NBA All-Star Game]] and had earned his first [[All-NBA]] selection. Together with [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and [[Michael Finley]], Nash led the Mavericks to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Finals the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|following season]]. He became a [[free agent]] after the {{nbay|2003|app=season}} and returned to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIn the {{nbay|2004|app=season}}, Nash led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals and was named the league's MVP. He was named MVP again in the {{nbay|2005|app=season}} and was runner-up for a third consecutive MVP to Nowitzki in [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307]]. Named by [[ESPN]] in 2006 as the ninth-greatest [[point guard]] of all time, Nash led the league in assists and [[free throw]] percentage at various points in his career. He is also ranked as one of the top players in NBA league history in [[three-point field goal|three-point shooting]], free throw shooting, total assists, and assists per game.\n\nNash has been honoured for his contributions to various philanthropic causes. In 2006, he was named by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]] in 2007 and invested to the order in 2016, and was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] by the [[University of Victoria]] in 2008. Nash has been a co-owner of the [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) since the team entered the league in 2011. From 2012 to 2019, he served as general manager of the Canadian men's national team, for whom he played from 1991 to 2003, making one [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] appearance and being twice named [[FIBA AmeriCup Most Valuable Player|FIBA AmeriCup MVP]].\n\n==Early life==\nNash was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, to a Welsh mother, Jean, and English father, John, on 7 February 1974.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080101192548/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5252 Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada], gg.ca.

He was an eight-time [[NBA All-Star]] and a seven-time [[All-NBA]] selection. Twice, Nash was named the [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the [[Phoenix Suns]]. He currently serves as senior advisor of the [[Canada men's national basketball team|Canadian men's national team]] and as a player development consultant for the [[Golden State Warriors]].\n\nAfter a successful [[high school]] basketball career in [[British Columbia]], Nash earned a scholarship to [[Santa Clara University]] in California. In his four seasons with the [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|Broncos]], the team made three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, and he was twice named the [[West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|West Coast Conference (WCC) Player of the Year]]. Nash graduated from Santa Clara as the team's all-time leader in [[assist (basketball)|assists]] and was taken as the 15th pick in the [[1996 NBA draft]] by the [[Phoenix Suns]]. He made minimal impact and was traded to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in 1998. By his fourth season with the Mavericks, he was voted to his first [[NBA All-Star Game]] and had earned his first [[All-NBA]] selection. Together with [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and [[Michael Finley]], Nash led the Mavericks to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Finals the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|following season]]. He became a [[free agent]] after the {{nbay|2003|app=season}} and returned to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIn the {{nbay|2004|app=season}}, Nash led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals and was named the league's MVP. He was named MVP again in the {{nbay|2005|app=season}} and was runner-up for a third consecutive MVP to Nowitzki in [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307]]. Named by [[ESPN]] in 2006 as the ninth-greatest [[point guard]] of all time, Nash led the league in assists and [[free throw]] percentage at various points in his career. He is also ranked as one of the top players in NBA league history in [[three-point field goal|three-point shooting]], free throw shooting, total assists, and assists per game.\n\nNash has been honoured for his contributions to various philanthropic causes. In 2006, he was named by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]] in 2007 and invested to the order in 2016, and was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] by the [[University of Victoria]] in 2008. Nash has been a co-owner of the [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) since the team entered the league in 2011. From 2012 to 2019, he served as general manager of the Canadian men's national team, for whom he played from 1991 to 2003, making one [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] appearance and being twice named [[FIBA AmeriCup Most Valuable Player|FIBA AmeriCup MVP]].\n\n==Early life==\nNash was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, to a Welsh mother, Jean, and English father, John, on 7 February 1974.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080101192548/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5252 Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada], gg.ca.

It often takes a well-defined number of [[clock cycles]] to execute. In other instruction sets, a NOP can be simulated by executing an instruction having operands that cause the same effect; e.g., on the [[SPARC]] processor, the instruction <code>sethi 0, %g0</code> is the recommended solution.\n\nA NOP is most commonly used for timing purposes, to force [[Data structure alignment|memory alignment]], to prevent [[hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]s, to occupy a [[branch delay slot]], to render void an existing instruction such as a jump, or as a place-holder to be replaced by active instructions later on in program development (or to replace removed instructions when reorganizing would be problematic or time-consuming). In some cases, a NOP can have minor side effects; for example, on the [[Motorola 68000]] series of processors, the NOP opcode causes a synchronization of the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]].<ref name=m68ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf|title=Motorola 68000 Programmer's Reference Manual}}</ref>\n\nListed below are the NOP instruction for some CPU architectures:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

A common [[compiler optimization]] is the [[Dead code elimination|detection and removal of this kind of code]]. Such code may be required by the grammar of the programming language, which does not allow a blank.\n\n=== Ada ===\nIn [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], the <code>null</code> statement serves as a NOP.<ref>[http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/05aarm/html/AA-5-1.html#S0134 Ada Reference Manual &mdash; null statements]. \"The execution of a null_statement has no effect.\"</ref> As the syntax forbids that control statements or functions be empty, the <code>null</code> statement must be used to specify that no action is required. (Thus, if the programmer forgets to write a sequence of statements, the program will fail to compile.)\n\n=== C and derivatives ===\nThe second line below is an example of a single [[C (programming language)|C]] statement that ''behaves'' like a NOP. In practice, most [[compilers]] will not generate code for this statement:\n   int i = 0;\n   i+1;\nThis statement performs an addition and discards the result. Indeed, any statement without side effects (and that does not affect control flow, e.g., break, return) can be removed, as the result of the computation is discarded.\n\nThe simplest possible statement in C that behaves like a NOP is the so-called ''null statement'', which is just a semi-colon in a context requiring a statement. (A compiler is not required to generate a NOP instruction in this case; typically, no instructions whatsoever would be generated.)\n   ;\nAlternatively, an empty block (compound statement) may be used, and may be more legible:\n   {}\nIn some cases, such as the body of a function, a block must be used, but this can be empty. In C, statements cannot be empty\u2014simple statements must end with a ; (semicolon) while compound statements are enclosed in {} (braces), which does not itself need a following semicolon. Thus in contexts where a statement is grammatically required, some such null statement can be used.\n\nThe null statement is useless by itself, but it can have a syntactic use in a wider context, e.g., within the context of a loop:\n<source lang=\"c\">\n  while (getchar() != '\\n') {}\n</source>\nalternatively,\n<source lang=\"c\">\n\n  while (getchar() != '\\n')\n      ;\n</source>\nor more tersely:\n<source lang=\"c\">\n\n  while (getchar() != '\\n');\n</source>\n(note that the last form may be confusing, and as such generates a warning with some compilers or compiler options, as semicolon usually indicates an end of function call instruction when placed after a round parenthesis on the end of line).\n\nThe above code continues calling the function ''getchar()'' until it returns a \\n (newline) character, essentially fast-forwarding the current reading location of standard input to the beginning of next line.\n\n=== Fortran ===\nIn [[Fortran]], the <code>CONTINUE</code> statement is used in some contexts such as the last statement in a DO loop, although it can be used anywhere, and does not have any functionality.\n\n=== Pascal ===\nAs with C, the ; used by itself can be used as a null statement in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. In fact, due to the specification of the language, in a BEGIN / END block, the semicolon is optional before the END statement, thus a semicolon used there is superfluous. \n\nAlso, a block consisting of <code> BEGIN END;</code> may be used as a placeholder to indicate no action, even if placed inside another BEGIN / END block.\n\n=== Python ===\nThe [[Python programming language]] has a [[Python programming language#Statements and control flow|<code>pass</code> statement]] which has no effect when executed and thus serves as a NOP. It is primarily used to ensure correct syntax due to Python's [[off-side rule|indentation-sensitive syntax]]; for example the syntax for definition of a [[class (computer programming)|class]] requires an indented block with the class logic, which has to be expressed as <code>pass</code> when it should be empty.\n\n=== JavaScript ===\nThe [[JavaScript]] language does not have a built-in NOP statement. Many implementations are possible:\n* Use the '<code>;</code>' ''empty statement''<ref>MDN JavaScript reference \u2013 [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/Empty empty statement]. \"The empty statement is a semicolon (<code>;</code>) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one.\"</ref> or the '<code>{}</code>' empty ''block statement'' the same way as in the [[NOP (code)#C_and_derivatives|C and derivatives]] examples;\n* Use the <code>undefined</code> or the <code>null</code> expression as a complete statement (an ''expression statement'') when the previous methods are not allowed by the syntax.\nAlternatives, in situations where a function is required, are:\n* Use the <code>Function.prototype()</code> built-in function, that accepts any arguments and returns <code>undefined</code>;<ref>ECMAScript Language Specification \u2013 Edition 5.1 \u2013 [https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.3.4 Properties of the Function Prototype Object]</ref>\n* Use a NOP function available in a third-party library \u2014see below;\n* Define a custom NOP function, as in the following example (using the [[ES6]] arrow function syntax):\n<source lang=\"javascript\">const noop = () => {};</source>\n\n==== Angular ====\nThe [[AngularJS|Angular]] framework provides [https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.noop angular.noop] function that performs no operations.\n\n==== jQuery ====\nThe [[jQuery]] library provides a function <code>jQuery.noop()</code>, which does nothing.<ref>[http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noop/ jQuery.noop()] from jQuery API documentation</ref>\n\n==== Lodash ====\nThe [[Lodash]] library provides a function <code>_.noop()</code>, which returns undefined and does nothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lodash.com/docs/#noop|title=Lodash Documentation|website=lodash.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell scripting (bash, zsh, etc.) ===\nThe '<code>:</code>' [colon] command is a shell builtin that has similar effect to a \"NOP\" (a do-nothing operation). It is not technically an NOP, as it changes the special parameter $? (exit status of last command) to 0. It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin 'true', and its exit status is true (0).<ref>[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide > Chapter 3. Special Characters]</ref><ref>bash manpage > SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</ref><ref>zsh manpage (zshbuiltins) > SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</ref>\n\n== NOP protocol commands ==\nMany [[protocol (computing)|computer protocol]]s, such as [[telnet]], include a NOP command that a client can issue to request a response from the server without requesting any other actions. Such a command can be used to [[Keepalive|ensure the connection is still alive]] or that the server is responsive.

It often takes a well-defined number of [[clock cycles]] to execute. In other instruction sets, a NOP can be simulated by executing an instruction having operands that cause the same effect; e.g., on the [[SPARC]] processor, the instruction <code>sethi 0, %g0</code> is the recommended solution.\n\nA NOP is most commonly used for timing purposes, to force [[Data structure alignment|memory alignment]], to prevent [[hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]s, to occupy a [[branch delay slot]], to render void an existing instruction such as a jump, or as a place-holder to be replaced by active instructions later on in program development (or to replace removed instructions when reorganizing would be problematic or time-consuming). In some cases, a NOP can have minor side effects; for example, on the [[Motorola 68000]] series of processors, the NOP opcode causes a synchronization of the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]].<ref name=m68ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf|title=Motorola 68000 Programmer's Reference Manual}}</ref>\n\nListed below are the NOP instruction for some CPU architectures:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

A common [[compiler optimization]] is the [[Dead code elimination|detection and removal of this kind of code]]. Such code may be required by the grammar of the programming language, which does not allow a blank.\n\n=== Ada ===\nIn [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], the <code>null</code> statement serves as a NOP.<ref>[http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/05aarm/html/AA-5-1.html#S0134 Ada Reference Manual &mdash; null statements]. \"The execution of a null_statement has no effect.\"</ref> As the syntax forbids that control statements or functions be empty, the <code>null</code> statement must be used to specify that no action is required. (Thus, if the programmer forgets to write a sequence of statements, the program will fail to compile.)\n\n=== C and derivatives ===\nThe second line below is an example of a single [[C (programming language)|C]] statement that ''behaves'' like a NOP. In practice, most [[compilers]] will not generate code for this statement:\n   int i = 0;\n   i+1;\nThis statement performs an addition and discards the result. Indeed, any statement without side effects (and that does not affect control flow, e.g., break, return) can be removed, as the result of the computation is discarded.\n\nThe simplest possible statement in C that behaves like a NOP is the so-called ''null statement'', which is just a semi-colon in a context requiring a statement. (A compiler is not required to generate a NOP instruction in this case; typically, no instructions whatsoever would be generated.)\n   ;\nAlternatively, an empty block (compound statement) may be used, and may be more legible:\n   {}\nIn some cases, such as the body of a function, a block must be used, but this can be empty. In C, statements cannot be empty\u2014simple statements must end with a ; (semicolon) while compound statements are enclosed in {} (braces), which does not itself need a following semicolon. Thus in contexts where a statement is grammatically required, some such null statement can be used.\n\nThe null statement is useless by itself, but it can have a syntactic use in a wider context, e.g., within the context of a loop:\n<source lang=\"c\">\n  while (getchar() != '\\n') {}\n</source>\nalternatively,\n<source lang=\"c\">\n\n  while (getchar() != '\\n')\n      ;\n</source>\nor more tersely:\n<source lang=\"c\">\n\n  while (getchar() != '\\n');\n</source>\n(note that the last form may be confusing, and as such generates a warning with some compilers or compiler options, as semicolon usually indicates an end of function call instruction when placed after a round parenthesis on the end of line).\n\nThe above code continues calling the function ''getchar()'' until it returns a \\n (newline) character, essentially fast-forwarding the current reading location of standard input to the beginning of next line.\n\n=== Fortran ===\nIn [[Fortran]], the <code>CONTINUE</code> statement is used in some contexts such as the last statement in a DO loop, although it can be used anywhere, and does not have any functionality.\n\n=== Pascal ===\nAs with C, the ; used by itself can be used as a null statement in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. In fact, due to the specification of the language, in a BEGIN / END block, the semicolon is optional before the END statement, thus a semicolon used there is superfluous. \n\nAlso, a block consisting of <code> BEGIN END;</code> may be used as a placeholder to indicate no action, even if placed inside another BEGIN / END block.\n\n=== Python ===\nThe [[Python programming language]] has a [[Python programming language#Statements and control flow|<code>pass</code> statement]] which has no effect when executed and thus serves as a NOP. It is primarily used to ensure correct syntax due to Python's [[off-side rule|indentation-sensitive syntax]]; for example the syntax for definition of a [[class (computer programming)|class]] requires an indented block with the class logic, which has to be expressed as <code>pass</code> when it should be empty.\n\n=== JavaScript ===\nThe [[JavaScript]] language does not have a built-in NOP statement. Many implementations are possible:\n* Use the '<code>;</code>' ''empty statement''<ref>MDN JavaScript reference \u2013 [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/Empty empty statement]. \"The empty statement is a semicolon (<code>;</code>) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one.\"</ref> or the '<code>{}</code>' empty ''block statement'' the same way as in the [[NOP (code)#C_and_derivatives|C and derivatives]] examples;\n* Use the <code>undefined</code> or the <code>null</code> expression as a complete statement (an ''expression statement'') when the previous methods are not allowed by the syntax.\nAlternatives, in situations where a function is required, are:\n* Use the <code>Function.prototype()</code> built-in function, that accepts any arguments and returns <code>undefined</code>;<ref>ECMAScript Language Specification \u2013 Edition 5.1 \u2013 [https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.3.4 Properties of the Function Prototype Object]</ref>\n* Use a NOP function available in a third-party library \u2014see below;\n* Define a custom NOP function, as in the following example (using the [[ES6]] arrow function syntax):\n<source lang=\"javascript\">const noop = () => {}</source>\n\n==== Angular ====\nThe [[AngularJS|Angular]] framework provides [https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.noop angular.noop] function that performs no operations.\n\n==== jQuery ====\nThe [[jQuery]] library provides a function <code>jQuery.noop()</code>, which does nothing.<ref>[http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noop/ jQuery.noop()] from jQuery API documentation</ref>\n\n==== Lodash ====\nThe [[Lodash]] library provides a function <code>_.noop()</code>, which returns undefined and does nothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lodash.com/docs/#noop|title=Lodash Documentation|website=lodash.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell scripting (bash, zsh, etc.) ===\nThe '<code>:</code>' [colon] command is a shell builtin that has similar effect to a \"NOP\" (a do-nothing operation). It is not technically an NOP, as it changes the special parameter $? (exit status of last command) to 0. It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin 'true', and its exit status is true (0).<ref>[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide > Chapter 3. Special Characters]</ref><ref>bash manpage > SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</ref><ref>zsh manpage (zshbuiltins) > SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</ref>\n\n== NOP protocol commands ==\nMany [[protocol (computing)|computer protocol]]s, such as [[telnet]], include a NOP command that a client can issue to request a response from the server without requesting any other actions. Such a command can be used to [[Keepalive|ensure the connection is still alive]] or that the server is responsive. A NOOP command is part of the following protocols (''this is a partial list''):\n*[[telnet]]\n*[[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]\n*[[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]\n*[[X Window core protocol|X11]]\n*[[Post Office Protocol|POP3]]\n*[[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]\n*[[Finger protocol|finger]]\n*[[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP4]]\n*[[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]\n*[[Character encoding]]: the [[null (Character)|null]] [[control character]]\nNote that unlike the other protocols listed, the IMAP4 NOOP command has a specific purpose\u2014it allows the server to send any pending notifications to the client.\n\nWhile most [[telnet]] or [[FTP]] servers respond to a NOOP command with \"OK\" or \"+OK\", some programmers have added quirky responses to the client.
