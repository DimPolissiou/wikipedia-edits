The site is near [[K\u00e2hta\u00e7ay]], known in ancient times as Nymphaios. Arsameia was a royal seat of the kingdom of [[Commagene]]. It is best known for the Hierothesion of [[Mithridates I Callinicus|King Mithridates I Kallinikos]], built for him by his son and heir [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochos I]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe ancient town of Nymphaios was renamed Arsameia in the third century BCE by the Armenian king [[Arsames I|Arsames]] (255\u2013225 BCE). It was then taken in 235 BCE by the [[Seleukid]] [[Antiochus Hierax]] who was fleeing from his brother [[Seleucus II]], who was later claimed as an ancestor by the Commagenian King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochus I]]. The city had already been abandoned again by Roman times, stones from local graves were used by Roman soldiers or building bridges.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=to3bsuF7OnYC&pg=PA198&dq=arsameia+am+Nymphaios&as_brr=3 Gernot Lang ''Klassische Antike St\u00e4tten Anatoliens: Klassische Antike St\u00e4tten Anatoliens I u.

Apart from the Hierothesion which Antiochos himself built on [[Nemrut Da\u011f\u0131]], and the second one on [[Karaku\u015f]] which his son Mithridates II built for the female members of the royal house, a third is to be found in Arsameia, the burial site and the associated cultic area for Antiochus' father Mithridates. A processional way leads up the mountain in the form of a Z and passes three sites which its discoverer [[Friedrich Karl D\u00f6rner]] marked as Sites I\u2013III. At the first of these, Site II, stands the fragment described as the [[Mithras]] relief. It is the right hand side of a [[dexiosis]], which shows Antiochos or Mithridates shaking hands with the sun god Mithras. Antiochus and those associated with him depicted themselves as being on the same level as the gods through these representations which are distributed throughout Commagene. D\u00f6rner was able to re-erect the upper and lower halves of Mithras, of the left-hand side of the relief only part of a shoulder was found, which D\u00f6rner however identified with one of the kings due to its clothing.\n\n[[image:ArsameiaSchrift.jpg|thumb|upright|Inscribed wall and entrance to the tunnel at Site III]]\n\nOn the first bend of the path is located Site I. Here too can be seen the remains of the depiction of a dexiosis, in which the portraits can no longer be identified. In addition to this there is a hallway carved into the rock, from which 14 steps lead up to a further room, nine meters high and about eight by eight meters in size. The function of this is not clear; D\u00f6rner took it to be a temple to Mithras, while other archaeologists conjecture that it could be the burial site of Mithridates.\n\nThe path leads on further to Site III. Here on a wall of rock was found an inscription of Antiochos in five columns, in which he relates the story of how the city was founded and the building of the Hierothesion as well as detailed instructions about how to carry out the rites that needed to be performed. Since the inscription had been almost completely covered in earth from ancient times it is still in an amazing condition. In the lower part of the inscribed wall a walkway begins that goes steeply up the rock and then suddenly ends after 158 metres. Nothing is known about its purpose. Above the wall stands the best preserved dexiosis relief of Commagene. It shows one of the two kings, either Antiochos or Mithridates shaking hands with a naked Herakles, recognizable from his club.\n\nThe processional way leads further beyond this site as far as the summit of the mountain. There was found the foundations of buildings with mosaic flooring, which can be dated back to the Second Century before Christ. On the basis of fragments of sculpture D\u00f6rner takes it that this is where the mausoleum of Mithridates stood, decorated with statues.\n\n==Yenikale and the Pigeon Castle ==\n[[image:AntiochosAntepMuseum.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of Antiochos from the plateau now in the museum at Gaziantep]]\n\nAbout two kilometers away, on the other side of the Kahta\u00e7ay, lies the fortress of Yenikale (\"New Castle\"). Here according to the inscription at Site III lay the Palace buildings of the Commagenian rulers. Today one can see a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mameluke]] castle. In its interior are found building and restoration inscriptions from the sultans [[Qala'un]] (1279\u201390), [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]] (1290\u201393) and [[al-Nasir Muhammad]] (1293\u20131341). An earlier building had already been conquered and destroyed in 1286 by Kara Sonkar, the governor of [[Aleppo]]. A path leads from the lower part of the castle on the side of the river to a building known as the \"Pigeon Castle\", which is positioned under an overhanging ledge of rock. It was used to provide water to the castle, as well as relaying it over a bridge to the Eski Kale. On the top floor is a room set up as a homing pigeon house, with a rectangular hole entry hole and 32 nesting niches. It was still being used for communications as late as the 13th century when the Sultan Qala'un was seeking information about the troop movements of the hostile [[Ilkhanate]] before the [[Second Battle of Homs]].<ref>Marianne Mehling (ed.): ''Knaurs Kulturf\u00fchrer in Farbe T\u00fcrkei''.

When he later found the inscriptional wall of Site III, which he could read straight away thanks to its excellent state of preservation, he was able to identify the site as the Commagenian royal seat of Arsameia. In 1953 he undertook the first excavations. Along with the American [[Theresa Goell]] he uncovered between the years 1953\u201356 the finds that are visible today.

Also, production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] when cells are fed and recharge their energy supplies requires phosphate.\n* [[Respiratory alkalosis]] \u2013 Any alkalemic condition moves phosphate out of the blood into cells. This includes most common respiratory alkalemia (a higher than normal blood pH from low carbon dioxide levels in the blood), which in turn is caused by any hyperventilation (such as may result from sepsis, fever, pain, anxiety, drug withdrawal, and many other causes).  This phenomenon is seen because in respiratory alkalosis carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) decreases in the extracellular space, causing intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> to freely diffuse out of the cell.  This drop in intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> causes a rise in cellular pH which has a stimulating effect on [[glycolysis]].  Since the process of glycolysis requires phosphate (the end product is [[adenosine triphosphate]]), the result is a massive uptake of phosphate into metabolically active tissue (such as muscle) from the serum.  However, that this effect is not seen in [[metabolic alkalosis]], for in such cases the cause of the alkalosis is increased bicarbonate rather than decreased CO<sub>2</sub>.  Bicarbonate, unlike CO<sub>2</sub>, has poor diffusion across the cellular membrane and therefore there is little change in intracellular pH.<ref name=\"obrien\">{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Thomas M|last2=Coberly|first2=LeAnn|year=2003|title=Severe Hypophosphatemia in Respiratory Alkalosis|journal=Advanced Studies in Medicine|volume=3|issue=6|pages=347|url=http://www.jhasim.com/files/journal_p345%28V3-6%29ClinicalV.pdf|access-date=2011-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815161118/http://www.jhasim.com/files/journal_p345(V3-6)ClinicalV.pdf|archive-date=2012-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*Metabolic acidosis\n* [[Alcohol abuse]] \u2013 Alcohol impairs phosphate absorption. Alcoholics are usually also malnourished with regard to minerals. In addition, alcohol treatment is associated with refeeding, and the stress of [[alcohol withdrawal]] may create respiratory alkalosis, which exacerbates hypophosphatemia (see above).\n* [[Malabsorption]] \u2013 This includes gastrointestinal damage, and also failure to absorb phosphate due to lack of vitamin D, or chronic use of phosphate binders such as [[sucralfate]], aluminum-containing antacids, and (more rarely) calcium-containing antacids.\n* Intravenous iron therapy \u2013 Iron (ferric carboxymaltose) infusion therapy is used to treat severe iron deficiency which is not responding to the first-line oral iron therapy. However, it can also cause severe renal wasting of phosphate resulting in severe hypophosphataemia in some patients. Despite the growing number of case reports, this side effect is not well known to healthcare professionals. The product labelling information sheet does mention that hypophosphataemia can be a side effect, but also says that this side effect is usually transient and asymptomatic.<ref name=Eseoghene></ref>\n\n\nPrimary hypophosphatemia is the most common cause of non-nutritional [[rickets]].
