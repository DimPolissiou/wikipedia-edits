(Great Britain)|A1(M)]], between [[Letchworth Garden City]] to the north and [[Welwyn Garden City]] to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].\n\n==Etymology==\nStevenage may derive from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''sti\u00feen \u0101c'' / ''sti\u00f0en \u0101c'' / ''stithen ac'' (various [[Old English language|Old English]] dialects cited here) meaning '(place at) the stiff [[oak]]'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes|first=H.G.|year=1948|chapter=A Land of Woods and Water|title=English Place-Names|location=Edinburgh|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd.|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe name was recorded as ''Stithen\u00e6ce'', c.1060 and ''Stigenace'' in 1086 in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\n==History==\nStevenage lies near the line of the [[Roman road]] from [[Verulamium]] to [[Baldock]]. Some [[Romano-British]] remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered in 1986 during new house building in the Chells Manor area. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is ''[[Six Hills]]'', six [[tumulus|tumuli]] by the side of the old [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] \u2013 presumably the burial places of a local family.\n\nA little to the east of the Roman sites the first [[Saxon people|Saxon]] camp was made in a clearing in the woods where the church, [[manor house]] and the first [[village]] were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall (though before the New Town Shephall was a separate parish and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth).\n\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] the [[Lord of the Manor]] was the [[Abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road and in 1281 it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to hold a weekly market and annual fair (still held in the High Street).\n\nThe earliest part of [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]] dates from the 12th century but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The known list of priests or rectors is relatively complete from 1213.\n\nThe remains of a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] moated homestead in Whomerley Wood is an 80-yard-square trench almost 5 feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle, and both Roman and later pottery has been found there.\n\nAround 1500 the Church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a [[clerestory]].\n\nIn 1558 [[Thomas Alleyne]], a rector of the town, founded a free [[grammar school]] for boys, [[The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School]], which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring [[Hitchin]]) until 1989 when it merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. [[Francis Cammaerts]] was headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed [[comprehensive school]] and is now an [[Academy]] as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to [[Great Ashby]], but the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010\u201315)]] proposed scrapping the move owing to [[Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts]].\n\nStevenage's prosperity came in part from the North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century. Many inns in the High Street served the [[stage coach]]es, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800.\n\nIn 1857 the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed, and the era of the stage coach had ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, \"The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.\"\n\nIn 1928 Philip Vincent bought the [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]] out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]]. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.\n\n==Stevenage New Town==\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square building works in 1959.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Square under development in 1959]]\n[[File:Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\n[[File:Stevenage Old Town - Middle Row.jpg|alt=Middle Row in Stevenage Old Town|thumb|Middle Row, Stevenage Old Town]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square CGI.jpg|alt=|thumb|CGI of Stevenage Town Square]]\n[[File:Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way - Stevenage.jpg|alt=|thumb|Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way, Stevenage]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\nSlow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the [[Second World War]], when the [[County of London Plan|Abercrombie Plan]] called for the establishment of a ring of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around London. On 1 August 1946, Stevenage was designated the first New Town under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-37826783|title=The town that aimed for Utopia|first=Jodie|last=Halford|date=11 November 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe plan was not popular and local people protested at a meeting held in the town hall before [[Lewis Silkin]], minister in the Labour Government of Clement Attlee. As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs 'Stevenage' to 'Silkingrad'. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town's residents): \"It's no good your jeering, it's going to be done.\" Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) 'entirely against' the expansion, the plan went ahead.<ref name=Austerity>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|author=David Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=161, 162|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed.\n\nIn 1949 the radical town planner Dr [[Monica Felton]] became Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the [[Korean War]] (for which she was later awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]) sullied her reputation.<ref>Mark Clapson, ''The rise and fall of Dr Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist'' on [http://www.fau.usp.br/iphs/abstractsAndPapersFiles/IPHS_miolo_20120711.pdf]</ref>\nFelton was replaced first by [[Allan Duff]] and later [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], who carried the project to completion.<ref>Stephen Ward, ''Peaceful Path: Building Garden Cities and New Towns'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2016</ref> [[Gordon Stephenson]] was the planner, [[Peter Shepheard]] the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer.<ref>Stevenage Museum, [http://www.talkingnewtowns.org.uk/content/topics/developing-a-new-town/eric-claxton-creating-safe-town Eric Claxton about creating a safe town] (interview transcript), 18 April 1986</ref> Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible.\n\nIn keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods. The first two of these to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood 'Estates', in 1951. The ''Twin Foxes'' pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage's first 'new' public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin [[poaching|poachers]] ([[Albert and Ebenezer Fox]]). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The \"Edward the Confessor\" pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary's Church in nearby [[Walkern]] as [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward]] reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern's church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the \"Our Mutual Friend\" in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of [[Our Mutual Friend|a novel]] by [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens was an occasional guest of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in nearby [[Knebworth House]] and knew Stevenage very well.\n\nNext to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and [[Symonds Green]]. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. {{As of|2014}} it was still under construction. The Government gave almost \u00a32 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 2 July 2013  (pt 0003)}}</ref>\n\nThe pedestrianized town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in [[UK|Britain]], taking its inspiration from the [[Lijnbaan]] in Rotterdam,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pedestrian and the City |last=Hass-Klau |first=Carmen |year=2014 |publisher= Routledge |page=87 }}</ref> and was officially opened in 1959 by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Architectural guide to Cambridge and East Anglia since 1920 |last=McKean |first=Charles |year=1982 |publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects|ERA Publications Board, RIBA Eastern Region]] |isbn=978-0-907598-01-5 |page=174 }}</ref> By the [[clock tower]] and ornamental pool is ''Joyride'', a mother and child sculpture by [[Franta Belsky]].  Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.\n\nNext to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a cathedral-like Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban's, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, 'The Urban Elephant' by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.\n\nAdjacent to yet separate from the residential parts of the town is the Industrial Area.

(Great Britain)|A1(M)]], between [[Letchworth Garden City]] to the north and [[Welwyn Garden City]] to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom's first [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] under the [[New Towns Act 1946|New Towns Act]].\n\n==Etymology==\nStevenage may derive from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''sti\u00feen \u0101c'' / ''sti\u00f0en \u0101c'' / ''stithen ac'' (various [[Old English language|Old English]] dialects cited here) meaning '(place at) the stiff [[oak]]'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stokes|first=H.G.|year=1948|chapter=A Land of Woods and Water|title=English Place-Names|location=Edinburgh|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd.|page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe name was recorded as ''Stithen\u00e6ce'', c.1060 and ''Stigenace'' in 1086 in the [[Domesday Book]].\n\n==History==\nStevenage lies near the line of the [[Roman road]] from [[Verulamium]] to [[Baldock]]. Some [[Romano-British]] remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered in 1986 during new house building in the Chells Manor area. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is ''[[Six Hills]]'', six [[tumulus|tumuli]] by the side of the old [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] \u2013 presumably the burial places of a local family.\n\nA little to the east of the Roman sites the first [[Saxon people|Saxon]] camp was made in a clearing in the woods where the church, [[manor house]] and the first [[village]] were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall (though before the New Town Shephall was a separate parish and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth).\n\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] the [[Lord of the Manor]] was the [[Abbot]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road and in 1281 it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] to hold a weekly market and annual fair (still held in the High Street).\n\nThe earliest part of [[St Nicholas' Church, Stevenage|St Nicholas' Church]] dates from the 12th century but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The known list of priests or rectors is relatively complete from 1213.\n\nThe remains of a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] moated homestead in Whomerley Wood is an 80-yard-square trench almost 5 feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle, and both Roman and later pottery has been found there.\n\nAround 1500 the Church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a [[clerestory]].\n\nIn 1558 [[Thomas Alleyne]], a rector of the town, founded a free [[grammar school]] for boys, [[The Thomas Alleyne Academy|Alleyne's Grammar School]], which, despite becoming a boys' comprehensive school in 1967, had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring [[Hitchin]]) until 1989 when it merged with Stevenage Girls' School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. [[Francis Cammaerts]] was headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed [[comprehensive school]] and is now an [[Academy]] as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street.  It was intended to move the school to [[Great Ashby]], but the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|Coalition government (2010\u201315)]] proposed scrapping the move owing to [[Building Schools for the Future|budget cuts]].\n\nStevenage's prosperity came in part from the North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century. Many inns in the High Street served the [[stage coach]]es, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800.\n\nIn 1857 the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed, and the era of the stage coach had ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, \"The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.\"\n\nIn 1928 Philip Vincent bought the [[HRD Motorcycles|HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]] out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd]]. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.\n\n==Stevenage New Town==\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square building works in 1959.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Square under development in 1959]]\n[[File:Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Park Place from Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\n[[File:Stevenage Old Town - Middle Row.jpg|alt=Middle Row in Stevenage Old Town|thumb|Middle Row, Stevenage Old Town]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Square CGI.jpg|alt=|thumb|CGI of Stevenage Town Square]]\n[[File:Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way - Stevenage.jpg|alt=|thumb|Autumn Oak - Broadhall Way, Stevenage]]\n[[File:Stevenage Town Centre Gardens.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stevenage Town Centre Gardens]]\nSlow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the [[Second World War]], when the [[County of London Plan|Abercrombie Plan]] called for the establishment of a ring of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] around London.

As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs 'Stevenage' to 'Silkingrad'. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town's residents): \"It's no good your jeering, it's going to be done.\" Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) 'entirely against' the expansion, the plan went ahead.<ref name=Austerity>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945\u201351|author=David Kynaston|authorlink = David Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=161, 162|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed.\n\nIn 1949 the radical town planner Dr [[Monica Felton]] became Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the [[Korean War]] (for which she was later awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]) sullied her reputation.<ref>Mark Clapson, ''The rise and fall of Dr Monica Felton, British town planner & peace activist'' on [http://www.fau.usp.br/iphs/abstractsAndPapersFiles/IPHS_miolo_20120711.pdf]</ref>\nFelton was replaced first by [[Allan Duff]] and later [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]], who carried the project to completion.<ref>Stephen Ward, ''Peaceful Path: Building Garden Cities and New Towns'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2016</ref> [[Gordon Stephenson]] was the planner, [[Peter Shepheard]] the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer.<ref>Stevenage Museum, [http://www.talkingnewtowns.org.uk/content/topics/developing-a-new-town/eric-claxton-creating-safe-town Eric Claxton about creating a safe town] (interview transcript), 18 April 1986</ref> Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible.\n\nIn keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods. The first two of these to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood 'Estates', in 1951. The ''Twin Foxes'' pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage's first 'new' public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin [[poaching|poachers]] ([[Albert and Ebenezer Fox]]). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The \"Edward the Confessor\" pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary's Church in nearby [[Walkern]] as [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward]] reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern's church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the \"Our Mutual Friend\" in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of [[Our Mutual Friend|a novel]] by [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens was an occasional guest of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in nearby [[Knebworth House]] and knew Stevenage very well.\n\nNext to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and [[Symonds Green]]. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. {{As of|2014}} it was still under construction. The Government gave almost \u00a32 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 2 July 2013  (pt 0003)}}</ref>\n\nThe pedestrianized town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in [[UK|Britain]], taking its inspiration from the [[Lijnbaan]] in Rotterdam,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pedestrian and the City |last=Hass-Klau |first=Carmen |year=2014 |publisher= Routledge |page=87 }}</ref> and was officially opened in 1959 by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Architectural guide to Cambridge and East Anglia since 1920 |last=McKean |first=Charles |year=1982 |publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects|ERA Publications Board, RIBA Eastern Region]] |isbn=978-0-907598-01-5 |page=174 }}</ref> By the [[clock tower]] and ornamental pool is ''Joyride'', a mother and child sculpture by [[Franta Belsky]].  Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.\n\nNext to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a cathedral-like Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban's, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, 'The Urban Elephant' by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.\n\nAdjacent to yet separate from the residential parts of the town is the Industrial Area. For many years [[British Aerospace]] (now [[MBDA]]) was the largest employer in the town but now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] has a large pharmaceutical research laboratory complex (which is known as 'The Palace' to many of its inhabitants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|title=Peter's weather website|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234840/http://www.pete-weather.me/wxabout.php|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref> A smaller but interesting enterprise is [[Astrium]], which for some decades (as part of British Aerospace and its predecessors) has manufactured spacecraft, both as prime contractor and as equipment supplier.\n\nThere are many small- to medium-size firms as well.

Indeed, the [[Woodland Trust]] ranks it as one of the best places in the UK for ease of access to large woodland, with 99.9% of the population having access to woodland over {{convert|2|ha|acre|0}} within {{convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, only slightly behind those living in the [[Forest of Dean]] or [[New Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/mediafile/100083906/space-for-people.pdf|title=2638 Space for People|year=2010|accessdate=3 January 2014|work=[[Woodland Trust]]}}</ref> There are also many playing fields (e.g. St. Nicholas playing fields near Ripon Road). The town's schools all have a substantial amount of ground; key examples are Ashtree Primary School, Moss Bury Primary School, Longmeadow Primary School and Barnwell.\n\nStevenage also has a basketball team: Stevenage Scorpions.\n\nThe town is surrounded by the Stevenage Outer Orbital Path (STOOP), a {{convert|27|mi|km|adj=on}} circuit walk established by the North Herts Ramblers Group in 2008. The circuit provides an informal, active recreational leisure amenity readily available to the residents of Stevenage and the surrounding villages. The STOOP is split into several sections, accessible via a series of links from the town. The route passes through [[Graveley, Hertfordshire|Graveley]], [[Walkern]], [[River Beane|Beane Valley]], [[Datchworth]], [[Woolmer Green]], [[Knebworth Park]], [[St Ippolyts]] and [[Little Wymondley]]. It was launched on 20 September 2008.<ref name=\"ramblers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ramblers-herts-northmiddlesex.org.uk/stoop.htm|title=STOOP (Stevenage Outer Orbital Path)|publisher=Hertfordshire & North Middlesex Area of the Ramblers' Association|accessdate=25 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143050/http://ramblers-herts-northmiddlesex.org.uk/stoop.htm|archivedate=22 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"SBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/townandcommunity/soneighbourly/stooprightonit|title=STOOP right on it|publisher=[[Stevenage Borough Council]]|accessdate=25 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718111408/http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/townandcommunity/soneighbourly/stooprightonit|archivedate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA small community arts centre is located in the Roaring Meg Retail Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/31028/31013/|title=Arts in Stevenage}}</ref> The Boxfield and Foyer Gallery is situated in the [[Gordon Craig Theatre]], which forms part of the large central Leisure Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon-craig.co.uk/EducationsVisualArts/VisualArts.aspx|title=Gordon Craig Theatre|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220506/http://www.gordon-craig.co.uk/EducationsVisualArts/VisualArts.aspx|archivedate=21 October 2013}}</ref> Stevenage Museum is located under the St. Andrew and St. George's church on St George's Way<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/about-stevenage/museum/|title=Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Nearby attractions==\nNorth of Stevenage Old Town, near St Nicholas' Church, lies Rooks' Nest (\"under the big [[wych elm|wych-elm]]\"), home of the novelist [[Edward Morgan Forster]] from 1884 to 1894. Forster used Rooksnest and the surrounding area as the setting for his novel ''[[Howards End]]''. In the preface to one paperback edition of ''Howards End'' there is a lot to be found about landmarks of Stevenage and their relationship to the story of the novel, such as Stevenage High Street and the [[Six Hills]]. The land north of St Nicholas' Church, known as Forster Country, is the last remaining farmland within the boundary of Stevenage borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forstercountry.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=27|title=Where is Forster Country?|publisher=Friends of the Forster Country|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=23 August 2009}}</ref> Forster was unhappy with the development of new Stevenage, which would, in his words, \"fall out of the blue sky like a meteorite upon the ancient and delicate scenery of Hertfordshire\".<ref name=Austerity/>\n\nAlso close to Stevenage is [[Knebworth House]], a [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic]] stately home and venue of globally renowned rock concerts since 1974. The house was once home to [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], Victorian English novelist and spiritualist.\n\n==Transport==\nA distinctive feature of Stevenage is its urban landscape.  It has many [[roundabout]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenheartpartnership.org/site/68/253.html|title=Stevenage \"sunken\" roundabout|author=Green Heart Partnership|accessdate=20 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413022700/http://www.greenheartpartnership.org/site/68/253.html|archivedate=13 April 2011}}</ref> few [[traffic light]]s, a network of completely segregated [[Segregated cycle facilities|cycleways]], and some of the tallest [[street light]]s in Britain. [[Eric Claxton]] was chief engineer of Stevenage from 1962 to 1972, and the comprehensive separate cycle network was planned and implemented by him during that period. Despite this network, the bike mode share is 2.7%.<ref>{{cite news|title=Build it and they will come?

He was so adamant about roundabouts that he had a house built for himself on the gyratory system in the Old Town.\n\nStevenage is served by the [[A1(M) motorway]]. The old [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] passes through the centre of the town, and the High Street in the Old Town has several pubs that were [[coaching inn]]s on this road; it is mostly now classified as the [[B197 road|B197]]. Stevenage is also served by the [[A602 road|A602]], connecting the town to [[Hitchin]], [[Watton-at-Stone]], Hertford and [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]].\n\nBuses within and to outside the town are provided by several operators, the main within the town being [[Arriva Shires & Essex#Hitchin/Stevenage|Arriva The Shires]]. Other operators include [[Centrebus]], [[Uno (bus company)|Uno]], Cozy Travel and Trusty Bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|title=About us|date=21 January 2016|website=TrustyBus|access-date=14 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115132524/http://www.trustybus.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date=15 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe town is served by [[Stevenage railway station]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and has regular commuter services to London and Cambridge, as well as connections to the North and Scotland.\n\n==Education==\nMany schools were built in the 1950s/60s due to an influx of Londoners to affordable terraced housing in areas such as Shephall, Broadwater, Chells and St Nicholas. The town has around 23 primary schools (see below). Some go to the surrounding villages of [[Aston, Hertfordshire|Aston]], [[Benington, Hertfordshire|Benington]], [[Walkern]], [[Datchworth]] for their schooling. Stevenage also has a number of secondary schools and the central campus for North Hertfordshire College.\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Almond Hill Junior<ref>{{cite

However, Malaysia failed to win any matches in the group stage.\n\n===Malaysia senior national team===\nKhairul Fahmi made his debut against [[Oman national football team|Oman]] on 3 September 2010 replacing [[Sharbinee Allawee]] during the second half. He kept a clean sheet for the entire second half after Malaysia conceding 3 goals in the first half of the match.\n\nIn November 2010, Khairul Fahmi was called up to the [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia national team]] by coach [[K. Rajagopal]] for the [[2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]]. Khairul kept a clean sheet against [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] on a 0\u20130 draw. He also kept a clean sheet against [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] twice in the semi finals. In the first leg of the finals, Khairul Fahmi played well against the Indonesians. The match ended a 3\u20130 win to Malaysia, thus earning another clean sheet to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.affsuzukicup.com/news/malaysia-3-indonesia-0-malaysian-blitz-buries-indonesia|title=Malaysia 3 Indonesia 0 - Malaysian blitz buries Indonesia|last=|first=|date=26 December 2010|website=AFF Suzuki Cup|publisher=WSG|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109184410/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/news/malaysia-3-indonesia-0-malaysian-blitz-buries-indonesia|archive-date=9 November 2013|access-date=28 December 2010}}</ref> In the second leg of the finals held in Indonesia, Khairul Fahmi gave another outstanding performance by making numerous saves including a brilliant penalty save early in the match. The save proved to be a pivotal moment in the match in which Malaysia scored an away goal. Malaysia won on 4\u20132 aggregate and lifted the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup title for the first time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/12/30/nation/7704715&sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230234954/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F12%2F30%2Fnation%2F7704715&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 December 2010 |title=Goalie makes it to global Twitter trending list |date=30 December 2010 |website=The Star Online |publisher=Star Publications (M) Bhd |access-date=30 December 2010 }}</ref> \n\nKhairul Fahmi was selected for the [[2012 AFF Suzuki Cup]]. On 26 November 2012, Malaysia's opening group match against Singapore ended up with the Malaysian side losing 0\u20133. The Lions scored the first goal through their captain, [[Shahril Ishak]] at the 32nd-minute. Six minutes later, Ishak once again scored a goal for the Lions as a result of Khairul Fahmi's blunder at goal. In the second half, veteran Singaporean forward [[Aleksandar \u0110uri\u0107]] completed the rout against the Tigers with the third and final goal of the game. The match resulted in [[2012 AFF Suzuki Cup]] holders Malaysia losing its first group match of the tournament, and Khairul Fahmi was subsequently dropped for the rest of the Tigers' campaign.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club===\n{{Updated|20 July 2019}}<ref name=\"K.

She began her educational career teaching mathematics and Latin in the Concord school system. In 1868, she moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island to teach at Miss Shaw's, a [[finishing school]] for young ladies. In the 1870s, Wheeler twice traveled to Europe to study art and painting, and between her trips enrolled in a variety of art history courses taught by [[Brown University]] professors. In 1882, she opened an art studio in the Waterman Building on North Main Street in Providence. Two years later, she moved into a house and studio she built at 24 Cabot Street and began to offer painting classes for young women three days a week, and for children on Saturdays. In addition, she held an evening lecture series on Greek literature and early American history.<ref name=\"Website\" />\n\nIn 1887, Wheeler took a group of young women to [[Giverny]], France for a summer of painting, art history and French.

She began her educational career teaching mathematics and Latin in the Concord school system. In 1868, she moved to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island to teach at Miss Shaw's, a [[finishing school]] for young ladies. In the 1870s, Wheeler twice traveled to Europe to study art and painting, and between her trips enrolled in a variety of art history courses taught by [[Brown University]] professors. In 1882, she opened an art studio in the Waterman Building on North Main Street in Providence. Two years later, she moved into a house and studio she built at 24 Cabot Street and began to offer painting classes for young women three days a week, and for children on Saturdays. In addition, she held an evening lecture series on Greek literature and early American history.<ref name=\"Website\" />\n\nIn 1887, Wheeler took a group of young women to [[Giverny]], France for a summer of painting, art history and French.

She had her secondary education at [[Wellington Girls' College]], where she wrote poetry and short stories for the school magazine.  After school she briefly attended [[Victoria University of Wellington]].  When she was 18, Hyde suffered a knee injury which required a hospital operation.  Lameness and pain haunted her for the rest of her life. In 1925 she became a journalist for Wellington's ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]'' newspaper, mostly writing for the women's pages. She continued to support herself through journalism throughout her life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Matthews|first=Jacqueline|title=Hyde, Robin|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4h41/1|work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage, New Zealand Government|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Later Life==\nWhile working at the ''Dominion'', she had a brief love affair with Harry Sweetman, who left her to travel to England. In 1926, in Rotorua for a holiday and treatment for her tubercular knee, Hyde had an affair with Frederick de Mulford Hyde. When Hyde fell pregnant, Frederick paid for her to have the child in [[Sydney, Australia]]. Their son, Christopher Robin Hyde, was stillborn. She was to adopt the name 'Robin Hyde' as a 'nom de guerre', to preserve his memory. On her return to New Zealand in December 1926, she discovered that Frederick had married. Traumatised by the loss of her child, Hyde was hospitalised at Queen Mary Hospital in [[Hanmer Springs]] and then cared for at the family home in Wellington, though only her mother knew of the pregnancy.<ref>Challis, Derek and Rawlinson, Gloria (2002), ''The Book of Iris: A Life of Robin Hyde'', Auckland University Press</ref> \n\nAfter a period of recovery, she began to write again, publishing poetry in several New Zealand newspapers in 1927.  She was also engaged to write columns for the [[Christchurch]] ''Sun'', and the ''Mirror''.  However, she became frustrated at the lack of creative input, as the papers merely wanted a social column.  Social columns or women's pages were the main outlet available to women journalists during the period. These experiences contributed to her treatise on journalism in New Zealand, ''Journalese'', published in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hyde|first=Robin|title=Journalese|year=1934|publisher=The National Printing Company|location=Auckland}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, while working for the ''Wanganui Chronicle'', Hyde had an affair with the Marton-based journalist Harry Lawson Smith. Their son, Derek Arden Challis, was born in Picton that October. Lawson Smith was married, and his only relationship with Hyde and their son was to provide sporadic maintenance payments. In time Hyde's mother learned of Derek's existence, but her father was never told. <ref>Challis, Derek and Rawlinson, Gloria (2002), ''The Book of Iris: A Life of Robin Hyde'', Auckland University Press, p. 207</ref> \n\nIn 1929 Hyde published her first book of poetry, ''The Desolate Star''.
