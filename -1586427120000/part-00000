The result stands alone as the record home win in the competition's history and the joint biggest win either home or away. The two teams went into the match at opposite ends of the table; Manchester United were second, while Ipswich Town were second from last. In the corresponding fixture at Ipswich's [[Portman Road]] ground earlier in the season, they had beaten United 3\u20132. Manchester United were missing [[Eric Cantona]], their French international [[Forward (association football)|forward]] who was serving a nine-month suspension, and their attacking partnership of [[Andy Cole]] and [[Mark Hughes]] was not well regarded. \n\nPlaying in front of the highest attendance in the league to that point in the season, United scored three times in the first half; [[Roy Keane]] opened the scoring, before Cole added two more. In the second half, United scored four times in the first twenty minutes; Cole scored his third and fourth, while Hughes also scored two. [[Paul Ince]] scored United's eighth with a [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] into an empty net while Ipswich's goalkeeper [[Craig Forrest]] was arguing with the referee, before Cole scored a Premier League-record fifth goal, United's ninth, in the 89th minute. Ipswich finished the season in last place and were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] that season while Manchester United were second, one point behind champions [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were the reigning [[Premier League]] champions, having won the [[1993\u201394 FA Premier League|1993\u201394 title]] by eight points ahead of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=120 |publisher=Racing Post |work=Soccerbase |title=Premiership 1993/94 |accessdate=14 April 2011 }}</ref> However, they had been knocked out of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League]] in the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]],<ref name=\"cole-transfer\">{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Ferguson invests \u00a37 million in Cole |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47000426/ |page=18 |work=The Guardian |via=Newspapers.com |date=11 January 1995 }}</ref> and were trailing Blackburn by three points at the top of the table going into this match.<ref name=\"table_1995-03-03\">{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/league-tables/premier-league/03-march-1995/ |title=Historic league table generator \u2013 Premier League table after close of play on 03 March 1995 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=20 March 2020 }}</ref> In response to their elimination from European competition, and their need for a goal-scorer, they signed [[Andy Cole]] from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million in January 1995.<ref name=\"cole-transfer\"/>{{efn|The transfer for Cole was \u00a36&nbsp;million, plus the \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]].<ref name=\"cole-transfer\"/>}}\n\n[[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] had returned to the top flight of English football in time for the start of the Premier League in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]];<ref>{{Cite news |first=Ruaidhr\u00ed |last=Croke |title=The 22 original Premier League teams: Where are they now? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/the-22-original-premier-league-teams-where-are-they-now-1.3181343 |work=[[Irish Times]] |date=10 August 2017 |accessdate=29 March 2020 }}</ref> however, they had finished in the bottom half of the table in both of the new league's first two seasons and had narrowly avoided relegation to the First Division in the final minutes of the 1993\u201394 campaign, finishing one point above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=1993/94 Season Review |url=https://www.premierleague.com/history/1993-94 |website=premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=20 March 2020 }}</ref> Coming into this match, Ipswich were in 21st place in the league, three points and a game ahead of bottom club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but eight points away from escaping the relegation zone.<ref name=\"table_1995-03-03\"/>\n\nBefore this match, the two teams had met 50 times in all competitions; Manchester United had the upper hand with 24 wins to Ipswich's 18.

[[Manchester]], on 4 March 1995 as part of the [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League]] finished in a 9\u20130 victory for Manchester United.  The result stands alone as the record home win in the competition's history and the joint biggest win either home or away. The two teams went into the match at opposite ends of the table; Manchester United were second, while Ipswich Town were second from last. In the corresponding fixture at Ipswich's [[Portman Road]] ground earlier in the season, they had beaten United 3\u20132. Manchester United were missing [[Eric Cantona]], their French international [[Forward (association football)|forward]] who was serving a nine-month suspension, and their attacking partnership of [[Andy Cole]] and [[Mark Hughes]] was not well regarded. \n\nPlaying in front of the highest attendance in the league to that point in the season, United scored three times in the first half; [[Roy Keane]] opened the scoring, before Cole added two more. In the second half, United scored four times in the first twenty minutes; Cole scored his third and fourth, while Hughes also scored two. [[Paul Ince]] scored United's eighth with a [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] into an empty net while Ipswich's goalkeeper [[Craig Forrest]] was arguing with the referee, before Cole scored a Premier League-record fifth goal, United's ninth, in the 89th minute. Ipswich finished the season in last place and were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] that season while Manchester United were second, one point behind champions [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were the reigning [[Premier League]] champions, having won the [[1993\u201394 FA Premier League|1993\u201394 title]] by eight points ahead of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=120 |publisher=Racing Post |work=Soccerbase |title=Premiership 1993/94 |accessdate=14 April 2011 }}</ref> However, they had been knocked out of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League]] in the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]],<ref name=\"cole-transfer\">{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Ferguson invests \u00a37 million in Cole |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47000426/ |page=18 |work=The Guardian |via=Newspapers.com |date=11 January 1995 }}</ref> and were trailing Blackburn by three points at the top of the table going into this match.<ref name=\"table_1995-03-03\">{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/league-tables/premier-league/03-march-1995/ |title=Historic league table generator \u2013 Premier League table after close of play on 03 March 1995 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=20 March 2020 }}</ref> In response to their elimination from European competition, and their need for a goal-scorer, they signed [[Andy Cole]] from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million in January 1995.<ref name=\"cole-transfer\"/>{{efn|The transfer for Cole was \u00a36&nbsp;million, plus the \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]].<ref name=\"cole-transfer\"/>}}\n\n[[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] had returned to the top flight of English football in time for the start of the Premier League in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]];<ref>{{Cite news |first=Ruaidhr\u00ed |last=Croke |title=The 22 original Premier League teams: Where are they now? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/the-22-original-premier-league-teams-where-are-they-now-1.3181343 |work=[[Irish Times]] |date=10 August 2017 |accessdate=29 March 2020 }}</ref> however, they had finished in the bottom half of the table in both of the new league's first two seasons and had narrowly avoided relegation to the First Division in the final minutes of the 1993\u201394 campaign, finishing one point above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=1993/94 Season Review |url=https://www.premierleague.com/history/1993-94 |website=premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=20 March 2020 }}</ref> Coming into this match, Ipswich were in 21st place in the league, three points and a game ahead of bottom club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but eight points away from escaping the relegation zone.<ref name=\"table_1995-03-03\"/>\n\nBefore this match, the two teams had met 50 times in all competitions; Manchester United had the upper hand with 24 wins to Ipswich's 18.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

When conditions are right, [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of phytoplankton algae can occur in surface waters. Phytoplankton are [[r-strategist]]s which grow rapidly and can double their population every day. The blooms can become toxic and deplete the water of oxygen.

They are [[heterotrophic]] (other-feeding), meaning they cannot produce their own food and must consume instead other plants or animals as food. In particular, this means they eat phytoplankton.\n\nZooplankton are generally larger than phytoplankton, mostly still microscopic but some can be seen with the naked eye. Many [[protozoan]]s (single-celled [[#Marine protists|protists]] that prey on other microscopic life) are zooplankton, including [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, [[radiolarian]]s, some [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[#Marine microanimals|marine microanimals]]. Macroscopic zooplankton (not covered further here) include pelagic [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[tunicate]]s, as well as planktonic [[chaetognatha|arrow worms]] and [[Polychaete|bristle worms]].\n\n'''Microzooplankton: major grazers of the plankton...'''\n<gallery mode=packed heights=144px style=float:left;>\nFile:Copepod 2 with eggs.jpg|[[Copepod]]s eat phytoplankton.

Marine microorganisms also recycle nutrients for use in the [[marine food web]] and in the process release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Microbial biomass and other organic matter (remnants of plants and animals) are converted to fossil fuels over millions of years. By contrast, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s liberates greenhouse gases in a small fraction of that time. As a result, the [[carbon cycle]] is out of balance, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels will continue to rise as long as fossil fuels continue to be burnt.<ref name=Cavicchioli2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Cavicchioli | first1 = R. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Timmis | first3 = K.N. | last4 = Azam | first4 = F. | last5 = Bakken | first5 = L.R. | last6 = Baylis | first6 = M. | last7 = Behrenfeld | first7 = M.J. | last8 = Boetius | first8 = A. | last9 = Boyd | first9 = P.W. | last10 = Classen | first10 = A.T. | last11 = Crowther | first11 = T.W. | year = 2019 | title = Scientists' warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 9| pages = 569\u2013586 | doi = 10.1038/s41579-019-0222-5 | pmid = 31213707 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Marine life]]\n* [[Deep chlorophyll maximum]]\n* [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series]]\n* [[International Census of Marine Microbes]]\n* [[Marine microbial symbiosis]]\n* [[Microbial biogeography]]\n* [[Microbial communities]]\n* [[Microbial ecology]]\n* [[Microbial food web]]\n* [[Microbial loop]]\n* [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur]]\n** [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms]]\n* [[Microbially induced sedimentary structure]]\n* [[Microbiology of oxygen minimum zones]]\n* [[Oceanic carbon cycle]]\n* [[Ooid]]\n* [[Picoeukaryote]]\n* [[Roseobacter]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n* Haq B.U. and Boersma A.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

However, phytoplankton numbers are usually kept in check by the phytoplankton exhausting available nutrients and by grazing zooplankton.<ref name=Wassilieff2006>Wassilieff, Maggy (2006) [https://teara.govt.nz/en/plankton/page-1 \"Plankton - Plant plankton\"], ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''.

It extends at least 5&nbsp;kilometers below the continental surface and 10.5&nbsp;kilometers below the sea surface, with temperatures that may exceed 100&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nAbove the surface living organisms consume organic matter and oxygen. Lower down, these are not available, so they make use of \"edibles\" ([[electron acceptor]]s) such as hydrogen released from rocks by various chemical processes, methane, reduced sulfur compounds and ammonium. They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface. Cells may live for thousands of years before dividing and there is no known limit to their age. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in bacteria and archaea, and 15% of the total biomass for the biosphere.
