In 1630, [[Puritan]] colonists from England founded Boston and helped it become the way it is today. Boston quickly became the political, commercial, financial, religious and educational center of the [[New England]] region. The [[American Revolution]] erupted in [[Boston]], as the British retaliated harshly for the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the patriots fought back. They besieged the British in the city, with a famous battle at [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Breed's Hill]] in Charlestown on June 17, 1775 (which was lost by the colonists, but inflicted great damage against the British) and won the [[Siege of Boston]], forcing the British to evacuate the city on March 17, 1776.  However, the combination of American and British blockades of the town and port during the conflict seriously damaged the economy, and the population fell by two thirds in the 1770s.\n\nThe city recovered after 1800, re-establishing its role as the transportation hub for the New England region with its network of railroads, and even more importantly, the intellectual, educational and medical center of the nation. Along with New York, Boston was the financial center of the United States in the 19th century, and was especially important in funding railroads nationwide.  In the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, it was the base for many [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery activities]]. In the 19th century the city was dominated by an elite known as the [[Boston Brahmin]]s. They faced the political challenge coming from Catholic immigrants. The Irish Catholics, typified by the [[Kennedy Family]], took political control of the city by 1900.\n\nThe industrial foundation of the region, financed by Boston, reached its peak around 1950; thereafter thousands of textile mills and other factories were closed down and the city went into decline. By the 21st century the city's economy had recovered and was centered on education, medicine, and high technology\u2014notably [[biotechnology]], while the many surrounding towns became residential suburbs.\n\n==Prehistoric era==\nThe [[Shawmut Peninsula]] was originally connected to the mainland to its south by a narrow [[isthmus]], [[Boston Neck]], and surrounded by [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]], an [[estuary]] of the [[Charles River]]. Several prehistoric Native American archaeological sites, including the [[Boylston Street Fishweir]], excavated during construction of buildings and subways in the city, have shown that the peninsula was inhabited as early as 7,500 years [[Before Present]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/mhc/mhcexh/exhidx.htm\n| title=Archaeology of the Central Artery Project: Highway to the Past\n| publisher=Commonwealth Museum \u2013 Massachusetts Historical Commission \n| year=2008\n| accessdate=April 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:Copp's Hill Burying Grounds Boston Detroit Publishing.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Copp's Hill Burying Ground]], founded 1659]]\nIn 1629, the [[Cambridge Agreement]] was signed in England among the [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].

This influenced every facet of Boston life, and made it imperative that colonists legislate morality as well as enforce marriage, church attendance, education in the Word of God, and the persecution of sinners. One of the  first schools in America, [[Boston Latin School]] (1635), and the first college in America, [[Harvard College]] (1636), were founded shortly after Boston's European settlement.\n[[File:A South-East View of the City of Boston in North America.jpg|thumb|right|''A South-East View of the City of Boston in North America'', printed at [[London]], c. 1730]]\nTown officials in colonial Boston were chosen annually; positions<ref>Robert Francis Seybolt.

By 1679, Boston Baptists were bold enough to open their own meetinghouse, which was promptly closed by colonial authorities. Expansion and innovation in practice and worship characterized the early Baptists despite the restrictions on their religious liberty.<ref>Milton P. Ryder, \"Swimming Against the Current: The Strange Therapy of Persecution; The Price Paid for Religious Liberty by Some Early Massachusetts Baptists and the First Baptist Church of Boston,\" ''American Baptist Quarterly,'' March 2002, Vol. 21 Issue 1, pp 11\u201327</ref> On June 1, 1660, [[Mary Dyer]] was hanged on Boston Common for repeatedly defying a law banning [[Quakers]] from being in the colony.\n\nThe [[Boston Post Road]] connected the city to New York and the major settlements in Central and Western Massachusetts.  The lower route ran near present-day [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] via [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  The upper route, laid out in 1673, left via Boston Neck and followed present-day [[U.S. Route 20]] until around [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts]]. It continued through [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut]].   \n[[File:Bunker Hill Monument and Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|Bunker Hill Monument]]\nFrom 1686 until 1689, Massachusetts and surrounding colonies were united.  This larger province, known as the [[Dominion of New England]], was governed by [[Sir Edmund Andros]], an appointee of [[James II of England|King James II]].  Andros, who supported the [[Church of England]] in a largely Puritan city, grew increasingly unpopular.  On April 18, 1689, he was [[1689 Boston revolt|overthrown due to a brief revolt]].  The Dominion was not reestablished.\n\n===Disasters in the 1700s===\nA particularly virulent sequence of six smallpox outbreaks took place from 1636 to 1698. In 1721\u201322, the most severe epidemic occurred, killing 844 people. Out of a population of 10,500, 5889 caught the disease, 844 (14%) died, and at least 900 fled the city, thereby spreading the virus.<ref>Ballard C. Campbell, ed. ''American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation'' (2008) pp 21\u201322</ref>  Colonists tried to prevent the spread of smallpox by isolation. For the first time in America, [[inoculation]] was tried; it causes a mild form of the disease. Inoculation was itself very controversial because of the threat that the procedure itself could be fatal to 2% of those who were treated, or otherwise spread the disease. It was introduced by [[Zabdiel Boylston]] and [[Cotton Mather]].<ref>Ola Elizabeth Winslow, ''A destroying angel: The conquest of smallpox in colonial Boston'' (1974)</ref>\n\nIn 1755, Boston endured the largest earthquake ever to hit the Northeastern United States, (estimated at 6.0 to 6.3 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]), called the ''[[1755 Cape Ann earthquake|Cape Ann earthquake]]''.

Its merchants avoided the customs duties which angered London officials and led to a crackdown on smuggling. Governor [[Thomas Pownall]] (1757 to 1760) tried to be conciliatory, but his replacement Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]]  (1760\u201369) was a hard-liner who wanted to stamp out the opposition voices that were growing louder and louder in town meetings and pamphlets. Historian Pauline Maier says that his letters to London greatly influenced officials there, but they \"distorted\" reality. \"His misguided conviction that the 'faction' had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition, for example, kept him from recognizing the radicals' peace-keeping efforts....Equally dangerous, Bernard's elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Pauline Maier|title=From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765\u20131776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aQuIbSA19YC&pg=PA151|year=1973|publisher=W.W.

In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day, and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768, \"certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town.\" Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the \"same strain of hysteria.\"<ref>G.

Boston played the primary role in sparking both the [[American Revolution]] and the ensuing [[American Revolutionary War]]. The [[Boston Massacre]] came on March 5, 1770, when British soldiers fired into unarmed demonstrators outside the British custom house, resulting in the deaths of five civilians and dramatically escalating tensions.<ref>Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1970)</ref>  Parliament, meanwhile, insisted on its right to tax the Americans and finally came up with a small tax on tea.  Up and down the 13 colonies, Americans prevented merchants from selling the tea, but a shipment arrived in Boston Harbor. On December 16, 1773, 30\u201360 local [[Sons of Liberty]], disguised as Native Americans, dumped 342 chests of tea in the harbor in the [[Boston Tea Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Coming of the American Revolution|url=http://www.masshist.org/revolution/teaparty.php|publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> The Sons of Liberty decided to take action in order to defy Britain's new tax on tea, but the British government retaliated with a series of harsh laws, closing down the Port of Boston and stripping Massachusetts of its self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosa|first=Greg|title=Analyzing the Boston Tea Party|date=2006|publisher=The Rosen group|location=New York}}</ref>  The other colonies rallied in solidarity behind Massachusetts, setting up the [[First Continental Congress]], while arming and training militia units. The British sent more troops to Boston, and made its commander General [[Thomas Gage]] the governor. Gage believed the Patriots were hiding munitions in the town of Concord, and he sent troops to capture them.  [[Paul Revere]], [[William Dawes]], and [[Dr. Samuel Prescott]] made their famous midnight rides to alert the [[Minutemen]] in the surrounding towns, who fought the resulting [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775. It was the first battle of the American Revolution.\n\nMilitia units across New England rallied to the defense of Boston, and Congress sent in General [[George Washington]] to take command.  The British were [[Siege of Boston|trapped in the city]], and suffered very heavy losses in their victory at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. \nWashington brought in artillery and forced the British out as the patriots took full control of Boston. The American victory on March 17, 1776, is celebrated as [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]].  The city has preserved and celebrated its revolutionary past, from the harboring of the USS ''[[USS Constitution|Constitution]]'' to the many famous sites along the [[Freedom Trail]].\n\n==19th century==\n{{Historical populations|type=USA\n| 1722|10567\n\n| 1765|15520\n\n| 1790|18320\n\n| 1800|24937\n\n| 1810|33787\n\n| 1820|43298\n\n| 1830|61392\n\n| 1840|93383\n\n| 1850|136881\n\n| 1860|177840\n\n| 1870|250526\n\n| 1880|362839\n\n| 1890|448477\n\n| 1900|560892\n\n| 1910|670585\n\n| 1920|748060\n\n| 1930|781188\n\n| 1940|770816\n\n| 1950|801444\n\n| 1960|697197\n\n| 1970|641071\n\n| 1980|562994\n\n| 1990|574283\n\n| 2000|589141\n\n| 2010|617594\n\n| 2011|625087\n\n| footnote=* = population estimate. {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}<ref name=\"1950_Census_Urban_populations_since_1790\">{{cite journal | title=1950 Census of Population | volume=1: Number of Inhabitants | at=Section 6, Pages 21\u20137 through 21-09, Massachusetts Table 4.

It had become one of the world's wealthiest international trading ports, exporting products like rum, fish, salt and tobacco.<ref>[http://www.universityarchives.com/browse.asp?sn=39159-001&show=True&thumbnails=True University Archives Colonial Boston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207181331/http://www.universityarchives.com/browse.asp?sn=39159-001&show=True&thumbnails=True |date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref>  The upheaval of the American Revolution, and the British naval blockade that shut down its economy, had caused a majority of the population to flee the city. From a base of 10,000 in 1780, the population approached 25,000 by 1800. The abolition of slavery in the state in 1783 gave blacks greater physical mobility, but their social mobility was slow.<ref>Jacqueline Barbara Carr, \"A Change 'as Remarkable as the Revolution Itself': Boston's Demographics, 1780\u20131800,\" ''New England Quarterly,'' Dec 2000, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 583\u2013602</ref>\n\nBoston was part of the New England corner of [[triangular trade]], receiving sugar from the [[Caribbean]] and refining it into [[rum]] and [[molasses]], partly for export to Europe.  Later, [[confectionery]] manufacturing would become another refined product made from similar raw materials.  Related companies with facilities in Boston included the [[Boston Sugar Refinery]] (inventors of [[granulated sugar]]), [[Domino Sugar]], the [[Purity Distilling Company]], [[Necco]], [[Schrafft's]], [[Squirrel Brands]] (as the predecessor Austin T.

The [[Boston Fruit Company]] began importing tropical fruit from the Caribbean in 1885; it is a predecessor of [[United Fruit Company]] and [[Chiquita Brands International]].\n\nBoston had the status of a town; it was [[Boston City Charter|chartered]] as a city in 1822.<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3865.html US History.com, Cities, Boston, Massachusetts]</ref> The second mayor was [[Josiah Quincy III]], who undertook infrastructure improvements in roads and sewers, and organized the city's dock area around the newly erected Faneuil Hall Marketplace, popularly known as Quincy Market. By the mid-19th century Boston was one of the largest manufacturing centers in the nation, noted for its garment production, leather goods, and machinery industries.  Manufacturing overtook international trade to dominate the local economy. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region made for easy shipment of goods and allowed for a proliferation of mills and factories. The building of the [[Middlesex Canal]] extended this small river network to the larger Merrimack River and its mills, including the [[Lowell mills]] and mills on the [[Nashua River]] in [[New Hampshire]].  By the 1850s, an even denser network of railroads (''see also [[List of railroad lines in Massachusetts]]'') facilitated the region's industry and commerce. For example, in 1851, [[Eben Jordan]] and Benjamin L. Marsh opened the [[Jordan Marsh]] [[Department store]] in downtown Boston. Thirty years later William Filene opened his own department store across the street, called [[Filene's]].\n\nSeveral turnpikes were constructed between cities to aid transportation, especially of cattle and sheep to markets. A major east-west route, the Worcester Turnpike (now [[Massachusetts Route 9]]), was constructed in 1810.  Others included the Newburyport Turnpike (now Route 1) and the Salem Lawrence Turnpike (now Route 114).\n\n===Brahmin elite===\nBoston's [[Boston Brahmin|\"Brahmin elite\"]] developed a particular semi-aristocratic value system by the 1840s\u2014cultivated, urbane, and dignified, the ideal Brahmin was the very essence of enlightened aristocracy.<ref>Ronald Story, ''Harvard and the Boston Upper Class: The Forging of an Aristocracy, 1800\u20131970'' (1985).</ref><ref>Paul Goodman, \"Ethics and Enterprise: The Values of a Boston Elite, 1800\u20131860,\" ''American Quarterly,'' Sept 1966, Vol. 18 Issue 3, pp 437\u2013451</ref>  He was not only wealthy, but displayed suitable personal virtues and character traits.  The term was coined in 1861 by Dr. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]<ref>Holmes entitled the first chapter of his 1861 novel ''Elsie Venner'' \"The Brahmin caste of New England\"; he had long been writing about the group without using the term \"Brahmin.\"</ref>  The Brahmin had high expectations to meet: to cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against \"avarice\" and insisted upon \"personal responsibility.\" Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society.  Young men attended the same prep schools and colleges,<ref>Ronald Story, \"Harvard Students, The Boston Elite, And The New England Preparatory System, 1800\u20131870,\" ''History of Education Quarterly,'' Fall 1975, Vol. 15 Issue 3, pp 281\u2013298</ref> and had their own [[Boston Brahmin accent|way of talking]]. Heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belonged to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists.  Politically, they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans.\n\nA poem about Boston, attributed to various people, describes the city thus: \"And here's to good old Boston / The land of the bean and the cod / Where Lowells talk only to Cabots / and Cabots talk only to God.\" While wealthy colonial families like the Lowells and Cabots (often called the ''[[Boston Brahmin]]s'') ruled the city, the 1840s brought waves of new immigrants from Europe. These included large numbers of [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Italy|Italians]], giving the city a large [[Roman Catholic]] population.\n\n===Abolitionists===\n[[Image:Boston-view-1841-Havell.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Boston from [[Dorchester Heights]], 1841.]]\nIn 1831, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] newsletter, in Boston. It advocated \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves\" in the United States, and established Boston as the center of the abolitionist movement. After the passing of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Boston became a bastion of abolitionist thought. Attempts by slave-catchers to arrest fugitive slaves often proved futile, which included the notable case of [[Anthony Burns]] and Kevin McLaughlin.  After the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Boston also became the hub of efforts to send anti-slavery New Englanders to settle in [[Kansas Territory]] through the [[Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company]].\n\n===Irish===\n[[File:Aerial Boston 1860-10-13.jpg|alt=A black-and-white aerial photo of Boston|thumb|This aerial photo of Boston was taken October 13, 1860 and is the second aerial photo after one of Paris.]]\nThe earliest Irish settlers began arriving in the early 18th century. Initially they were indentured servants who came to work in Boston and New England for five to seven years, before gaining their independence. They were mainly individuals and families, and they were forced to hide their religious roots since Catholicism was banned in the Bay Colony. Then in 1718, congregations of Presbyterians from Ulster in the north of Ireland began arriving in Boston Harbor. They were referred to as Ulster Irish but later were referred to as Scots-Irish because many of them had roots in Scotland. The Puritan leaders initially sent the Ulster Irish to the fringes of the Bay Colony, where they settled places like Belfast, Maine, Londonderry and Derry, New Hampshire, and Worcester, Massachusetts. But by 1729 they were permitted to set up a church in downtown Boston.<ref>[http://globepequot.com/irish_boston_2nd-9780762788347 ''Irish Boston: A Lively Look at Boston's Colorful Irish History'', by Michael Quinlin. Published by Globe Pequot Press, 2013.]</ref>\n\nThroughout the 19th century, Boston became a haven for Irish Catholic immigrants, especially following the [[The Great Hunger|potato famine of 1845\u201349]]. Their arrival transformed Boston from a singular, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city to one that has progressively become more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1850s, an anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant movement was directed against the Irish, called the Know Nothing Party. But in the 1860s, many Irish immigrants joined the Union ranks to fight in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism and valor began to soften the harsh sentiments of Yankees about the Irish.<ref>[[Thomas H. O'Connor]], ''The Boston Irish: A Political History'' (1995) ch 3</ref>\n\nEven to the present day, Boston still commands the largest percentage of Irish-descended people of any city in the United States. With an expanding population, group loyalty, and block by block political organization, the Irish took political control of the city, leaving the Yankees in charge of finance, business and higher education. The Irish left their mark on the region in a number of ways: in still heavily Irish neighborhoods such as [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] and [[South Boston]]; in the name of the local basketball team, the [[Boston Celtics]]; in the dominant Irish-American political family, the [[Kennedys]]; in a large number of prominent local politicians, such as [[James Michael Curley]]; in the establishment of Catholic [[Boston College]] as a rival to [[Harvard]]; and in underworld figures such as [[James \"Whitey\" Bulger]].<ref>O'Connor, ''The Boston Irish: A Political History'' (1995) ch 9</ref>\n\n===Great Fire of 1872===\nThe [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] started at the corner of Summer Street and Kingston Street on November 9. In two days the conflagration destroyed about 65 acres (260,000 m\u00b2) of the city, including 776 buildings in the [[Financial District (Boston, Massachusetts)|financial district]], totaling $60 million in damage.\n\n[[Image:Scollay1880s.jpg|thumb|left|Scollay Square, Boston, in the 1880s.]]\n[[Image:Boston ground 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Map showing all ground in Boston occupied by buildings in 1880. From [[U.S. Census Bureau]].]]\n\n===High culture===\n[[File:19th_century_idealized_illustration_of_Copley_Square,_Boston.jpg|right|thumb|Idealized illustration of [[Copley Square]] from an 1890s clothing catalog, prominently featuring [[H. H. Richardson]]'s [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]]]]\nFrom the mid-to-late-19th century, the Boston Brahmins flourished culturally\u2014they became renowned for its rarefied literary culture and lavish artistic patronage. Literary residents included, among many others, writers [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Julia Ward Howe]], as well as historians [[John Lothrop Motley]], [[John Gorham Palfrey]], [[George Bancroft]], [[William Hickling Prescott]],  [[Francis Parkman]], [[Henry Adams]], [[James Ford Rhodes]], [[Edward Channing]] and [[Samuel Eliot Morison]]. Also there were theologians and philosophers such as [[William Ellery Channing]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Mary Baker Eddy]]. When [[Bret Harte]] visited Howells, he remarked that in Boston \"it was impossible to fire a revolver without bringing down the author of a two-volume work.\" Boston had many great publishers and magazines, such as ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' (founded 1857) and the publishers [[Little, Brown and Company]], [[Houghton Mifflin]], and [[Harvard University Press]].<ref>Van Wyck Brooks, ''The flowering of New England'' (1955)</ref>\n\nHigher education became increasingly important, principally at Harvard (based across the river in Cambridge), but also at other institutions. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) opened in the city in 1865. The first medical school for women, The Boston Female Medical School (which later merged with the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine), opened in Boston on November 1, 1848. The Jesuits opened [[Boston College]] in 1863; [[Emerson College]] opened in 1880, and [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]] for women in 1899.\n\nThe Brahmins were the foremost authors and audiences of high culture, despite being a minority. Emerging Irish, Jewish, and Italian cultures made little to no impact on the elite.<ref>{{cite book|author=E. Digby Baltzell|title=Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ZL0-hg2owC&pg=PA286|year=1979|publisher=Transaction Publishers|pages=286, 430|isbn=9781412832571}}</ref>\n\nTo please a different audience, the first [[vaudeville]] theater opened on February 28, 1883, in Boston. The last one, the Old Howard in [[Scollay Square]], which had evolved from opera to vaudeville to burlesque, closed in 1953.\n\nThe public Boston Museum of Natural History (founded in 1830 and renamed the New England Museum of Natural History in 1864, and the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston Museum of Science]] in the mid-twentieth century), was run by the Boston Society of Natural History.  It served the function of public and professional education in natural history, including ocean life, geology and mineralogy.  Around the end of the 19th century a scientific library and children's rooms were added.  In addition, the private Warren Museum of Natural History at Boston operated 1858\u20131906. It was acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 1906.<ref>Paul DiMaggio, Paul. \"Cultural entrepreneurship in nineteenth-century Boston.\" in Chandra Mukerji and Mich\u00e6l Schudson, eds, ''Rethinking Popular Culture: Contemporary Perspectives in Cultural Studies'' (1991) pp 374+.</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\nAs the population increased rapidly, [[Boston-area streetcar lines]] facilitated the creation of a profusion of [[streetcar suburbs]].  Middle-class businessmen, office workers and professionals lived in the suburbs and commuted into the city by subway.<ref>Sam Bass Warner, ''Streetcar suburbs'' (1978).</ref>  Downtown congestion worsened, prompting the opening of the first [[Subway (rail)|subway]] in North America on September 1, 1897, the [[Tremont Street Subway]]. Between 1897 and 1912, subterranean rail links were built to Cambridge and East Boston, and elevated and underground lines expanded into other neighborhoods from downtown. Today, the regional passenger rail and bus network has been consolidated into the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. Two union stations, [[North Station (Boston)|North Station]] and [[South Station, Boston|South Station]] were constructed to consolidate downtown railroad terminals.\n\n===Censorship===\nFrom the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, the phrase \"[[Banned in Boston]]\" was used to describe a literary work, motion picture, or play prohibited from distribution or exhibition. During this time, Boston city officials took it upon themselves to \"ban\" anything that they found to be salacious, immoral, or offensive: theatrical shows were run out of town, books confiscated, and motion pictures were prevented from being shown\u2014sometimes stopped in mid-showing after an official had \"seen enough\".  The phrase \"banned in Boston\" came to suggest something sexy and lurid; some distributors advertised that their products had been banned in Boston, when in fact they had not.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Twentieth century Boston (2674949807).jpg|thumb|1905]]\n[[File:1917 Boston Index Card Co byLewisHine 1.jpg|thumb|right|Child labor in Boston, 1917.

Extending her role as teacher and mother she became an ethnic spokesperson as she confronted the power of the Yankee Protestant men of the Public School Association. She worked to replace 37-year-old textbooks, to protect the claims of local Boston women for career opportunities in the school system, and to propose a degree-granting teachers college. In 1905, the 25 member committee was reduced to five, which blocked women's opportunities for direct participation in school policies.<ref>Polly Welts Kaufman, \"Julia Harrington Duff: An Irish Woman Confronts the Boston Power Structure, 1900\u20131905,\" ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'',  1990 18(2): 113\u2013137, 25p.

Twenty-one people were killed and 150 injured as an immense wave of molasses, which rushed through the streets at an estimated {{convert|35|mph}}, crushed and asphyxiated many of the victims to death.

Boston fell prey to several riots as there were minimal law officers to maintain order in the city. [[Calvin Coolidge]], then governor of Massachusetts, garnered national fame for quelling violence by almost entirely replacing the police force. The [[Boston Police Strike|1919 Boston Police Strike]] would ultimately set precedent for police unionization across the country.\n\nOn August 23, 1927, Italian [[anarchists]] [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] were sent to the electric chair after a seven-year trial in Boston. Their execution sparked riots in London, Paris and Germany, and helped to reinforce the image of Boston as a hotbed of intolerance and discipline.\n\n===Mid-century transportation and urban renewal===\n[[File:Old John Hancock Tower and the Boston skyline in summer of 1956.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Berkeley Building|Old John Hancock Tower]] and Boston skyline, as it appeared in 1956]]\n[[Image:Boston, Massachusetts 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|1955 Yellow Book plan for the Boston-area highway system.]] The [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|I-695 Inner Belt]] shown on this map was never built.

Few major buildings were being built anywhere in the city. Factories were closing and moving their operations south, where labor was cheaper. The assets Boston had\u2014excellent banks, hospitals, universities and technical know-how\u2014were minimal parts of the U.S. economy. To combat this downturn, Boston's politicians enacted [[urban renewal]] policies, which resulted in the demolition of several neighborhoods, including the New York Streets district in the [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]], the [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|old West End]], a largely [[Jewish]] and [[Italian-American|Italian]] neighborhood, and [[Scollay Square]]. In their places went a new headquarters for the [[Boston Herald]], the Charles River Park apartment complex, additions to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], and [[Scollay Square|Government Center]]. These projects displaced thousands, closed hundreds of businesses, and provoked a furious backlash, which in turn ensured the survival of many historic neighborhoods.\n\nIn 1948, [[William F. Callahan]] had published the Master Highway Plan for Metropolitan Boston. Parts of the financial district, Chinatown, and the North End were demolished to make way for construction. By 1956, the northern part of the [[Central Artery]] had been constructed, but strong local opposition resulted in the southern downtown portion being built underground. The [[Dewey Square Tunnel]] connected downtown to the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]]. In 1961, the [[Callahan Tunnel]] opened, paralleling the older Sumner Tunnel.\n\nBy 1965, the first [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] Extension was completed from Route 128 to near [[South Station (Boston)|South Station]]. The proposed [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, and Somerville was canceled due to public outcry. <!-- not sure when, exactly --> In 1971, public protest canceled the routing of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] into downtown Boston. Demolition had already begun along the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]], which was instead used to re-route the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\n===World War II and later===\nOn November 28, 1942, Boston's Cocoanut Grove [[nightclub]] was the site of the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]], the deadliest nightclub fire in United States history, killing 492 people and injuring hundreds more.\n\nDuring the war years, antisemitic violence escalated in Boston. Gangs largely composed of Irish Catholic youths desecrated Jewish cemeteries and synagogues, vandalized Jewish stores and homes, and physically assaulted Jews in the streets. The Boston police force, which was made up largely of Irish Catholics, seldom intervened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Norwood | first1 = Stephen H. | year =2003 | title = Marauding Youth and the Christian Front: Antisemitic Violence in Boston and New York during World War II | url = | journal = American Jewish History | volume =  91 | issue  = 2| pages = 233\u2013267 | doi = 10.1353/ajh.2004.0055 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the [[Great Brink's Robbery]] was committed; at the time it was the largest bank robbery in the United States, with the thieves stealing $2.775 million.\n\nIn 1953, the [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing projects were completed on the Dorchester peninsula. There were 1,502 units in the development on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land. In 1966, the Columbia Point Health Center opened and was the first community health center in the country.\n\nBetween June 14, 1962, and January 4, 1964, as many as thirteen single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in Boston by the infamous [[The Boston Strangler|Boston Strangler]]. (The actual number remains in dispute.)\n\n[[Image:Boston Back Bay.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Aerial view of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] ]]\nIn the 1970s, after years of economic downturn, Boston boomed again. Financial institutions were granted more latitude, more people began to play the market, and Boston became a leader in the [[mutual fund]] industry. Health care became more extensive and expensive, and hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] led the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Higher education also became more expensive, and universities such as [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Boston College]], [[Boston University|BU]] and [[Tufts University|Tufts]] attracted hordes of students to the Boston area; many stayed and became permanent residents. MIT graduates, in particular, founded many successful [[high-tech]] companies, which made Boston second only to [[Silicon Valley]] as a high-tech center.\n\nIn 1974, the city [[Boston busing crisis|dealt with a crisis]] when a federal district court judge, W. Arthur Garrity, ordered [[desegregation busing]] to integrate the city's public schools. Racially motivated violence erupted in several neighborhoods (many white parents resisted the busing plan). Public schools\u2014particularly public high schools\u2014became scenes of unrest and violence. Tension continued throughout the mid-1970s, reinforcing Boston's reputation for discrimination. A famous photograph, ''[[The Soiling of Old Glory]]'', was taken in front of Boston City Hall, viscerally depicting the conflict.\n\nThe Columbia Point housing complex deteriorated until only 350 families remained living there in 1988.   In 1984, the city of Boston gave control of the complex to a private developer, Corcoran-Mullins-Jennison, who re-developed and re-vitalised the property into a residential mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments.  It is a very significant example of revitalisation and re-development and was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, [[mixed-income housing]] in the USA. Harbor Point has won much acclaim for this transformation, including awards from the [[Urban Land Institute]], the [[FIABCI]] Award for International Excellence, and the [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]].<ref name=\"Bruner Foundation\">{{cite web|title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba|publisher=Bruner Foundation|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>Kamin, Blair.

Twelve paintings, collectively worth over $100 million, were stolen from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] by two thieves posing as police officers. The paintings were not recovered.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Big Dig and public transit in the 2000s===\n[[Image:FleetCenterAndZakimBridge20040729.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Boston's Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge is a result of the Big Dig.]]\nIn 2007, the Central Artery/Tunnel project was completed. Nicknamed the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]], it had been planned and approved in the 1980s under Massachusetts governor [[Michael Dukakis]]. With construction beginning in 1991, the Big Dig moved the remainder of the Central Artery underground, widened the north-south highway, and created local bypasses to prevent east-west traffic from contributing to congestion. The [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] became the third highway tunnel to East Boston and [[Logan International Airport]] as part of the project. The Big Dig also produced the landmark [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]], and will create over 70 acres (280,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of public parks in the heart of the city. The project as a whole has eased (but not eliminated) Boston's notorious traffic congestion; however, it is the most expensive construction project in United States history and the [[List of megaprojects|most expensive construction project]] in the world.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Susan Moir (University of Massachusetts Lowell) | title=Big Dig | journal=Electronic Library of Construction \u2013 Occupational Safety and Health (CDC) | url=http://www.elcosh.org/docs/d0100/d000067/d000067.html}}</ref>\n <!---really needs dollars here someplace. Hard to believe this exceeds, in current dollars, the chunnel under the English channel--->\n\nThe city also saw other transportation projects, including improvement and expansion to its mass transit system, notably to its commuter rail system to southeastern Massachusetts and the development of a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system dubbed \"The Silver Line.\" The maritime [[Port of Boston]] and [[Logan International Airport]] were also developed.\n\n==21st century==\n[[Image:Boston20040307-03.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Downtown Boston as seen from Cambridge]]\nRecently, Boston has experienced a loss of regional institutions and traditions, which once gave it a very distinct social character, as it has become part of the [[Northeast megalopolis|northeastern megalopolis]]. Examples include: the acquisition of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' by ''[[The New York Times]]''; the loss of Boston-headquartered publishing houses (noted above); the acquisition of the century-old Jordan Marsh department store by [[Macy's]]; and the loss to mergers, failures, and acquisitions of once-prominent financial institutions such as Shawmut Bank, BayBank, Bank of New England, and Bank of Boston. In 2004, this trend continued as [[Charlotte]]-based [[Bank of America]] acquired [[FleetBoston Financial]], and [[P&G]] has announced plans to acquire [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]].\n\nDespite these losses, Boston's ambiance remains unique among [[Global city|world cities]] and, in many ways, has improved in recent years\u2014racial tensions have eased dramatically, city streets bustle with a vitality not seen since the 1920s, and once again Boston has become a hub of intellectual, technological, and political ideas. Nevertheless, the city had to tackle [[gentrification]] issues and rising living expenses. According to ''Money Magazine'', Boston is one of the world's 100 most expensive cities.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2005/06/21/pf/costliest_cities/ \"World's most expensive cities.\" ''Money Magazine'']. Accessed June 30, 2005.</ref>\n\nBoston was the host city of the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. The city also found itself at the center of national attention in early 2004 during the controversy over [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|same-sex marriage]]s. After the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled that such marriages cannot be banned under the state's constitution, opponents and supporters of such marriages converged on the [[Massachusetts State House]] as the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]] voted on a state constitutional amendment that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman. Much attention was focused on the city and the rest of Massachusetts when marriage licenses for same-sex couples were issued.\n\nAlso in [[2004 World Series|2004]], the [[Boston Red Sox]] won their first [[World Series]] in 86 years, following it up three years later with a victory in [[2007 World Series|2007]], another in [[2013 World Series|2013]], and another World Series win in [[2018 World Series|2018]]. Boston sports continue to dominate.\n\nOn April 15, 2013, [[Boston Marathon bombings|two bombs were detonated]] during the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring hundreds.\n\nOn August 20, 2017 the [[.boston]] top-level internet domain ([[GeoTLD]]) officially started taking registrations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bray |first1=Hiawatha |date=August 10, 2017 |title=The dot-Boston domain is now open |trans-title= |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/08/10/the-dot-boston-domain-now-open/06SU5Q82wWHMTW51ZfwoJO/story.html |access-date=February 18, 2018 |url-access=subscription  |quote=The .boston domain was initially awarded to the city of Boston and the Boston Globe in 2012, but the media company sold off nearly all its interests in the venture to Minds + Machines Group Limited, a company specializing in the operation of Internet domains.

Beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a {{convert|50|acre|ha|adj=on}} mill pond that later became the [[Bulfinch Triangle Historic District|Bulfinch Triangle]] (just south of today's North Station area). The present-day [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] sits atop this shortened Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the areas now known as the South End, West End, Financial District, and Chinatown. After [[Great Boston Fire of 1872|The Great Boston Fire of 1872]], building rubble was used as landfill along the downtown waterfront.\n\nThe most dramatic reclamation project was the filling in of the Back Bay in the mid to late 19th century. Almost six hundred acres (240 hectares) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of the Boston Common were filled in with gravel brought in by rail from the hills of [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham Heights]].\n\nBoston also grew by annexing the adjacent communities of [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] (including [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]] and [[Roslindale, Massachusetts|Roslindale]]), [[South Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]], [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[Allston, Boston, Massachusetts|Allston]], [[Hyde Park, Boston, Massachusetts|Hyde Park]], and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], some of which were also augmented by landfill reclamation. Several proposals to regionalize municipal government failed due to concerns about loss of local control, corruption, and Irish immigration, including:<ref>{{cite news|agency=Boston Globe|title=Welcome to Megaboston|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/01/22/welcome-megaboston/nYTuQFpRryVrd8i35yFjsL/story.html#|date=January 22, 2012|accessdate=January 22, 2012|author=Chris Marstall}}</ref>\n* 1896 \u2013 \"County of Boston\" proposal in the state legislature\n* 1910 \u2013 \"Real Boston\" proposal by Edward Filene to create a regional advisory board\n* 1912 \u2013 \"Greater Boston\" proposal by Daniel J.

In 1630, [[Puritan]] colonists from England founded Boston and helped it become the way it is today. Boston quickly became the political, commercial, financial, religious and educational center of the [[New England]] region. The [[American Revolution]] erupted in [[Boston]], as the British retaliated harshly for the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the patriots fought back. They besieged the British in the city, with a famous battle at [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Breed's Hill]] in Charlestown on June 17, 1775 (which was lost by the colonists, but inflicted great damage against the British) and won the [[Siege of Boston]], forcing the British to evacuate the city on March 17, 1776.  However, the combination of American and British blockades of the town and port during the conflict seriously damaged the economy, and the population fell by two thirds in the 1770s.\n\nThe city recovered after 1800, re-establishing its role as the transportation hub for the New England region with its network of railroads, and even more importantly, the intellectual, educational and medical center of the nation. Along with New York, Boston was the financial center of the United States in the 19th century, and was especially important in funding railroads nationwide.  In the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, it was the base for many [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery activities]]. In the 19th century the city was dominated by an elite known as the [[Boston Brahmin]]s. They faced the political challenge coming from Catholic immigrants. The Irish Catholics, typified by the [[Kennedy Family]], took political control of the city by 1900.\n\nThe industrial foundation of the region, financed by Boston, reached its peak around 1950; thereafter thousands of textile mills and other factories were closed down and the city went into decline. By the 21st century the city's economy had recovered and was centered on education, medicine, and high technology\u2014notably [[biotechnology]], while the many surrounding towns became residential suburbs.\n\n==Prehistoric era==\nThe [[Shawmut Peninsula]] was originally connected to the mainland to its south by a narrow [[isthmus]], [[Boston Neck]], and surrounded by [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]], an [[estuary]] of the [[Charles River]]. Several prehistoric Native American archaeological sites, including the [[Boylston Street Fishweir]], excavated during construction of buildings and subways in the city, have shown that the peninsula was inhabited as early as 7,500 years [[Before Present]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/mhc/mhcexh/exhidx.htm\n| title=Archaeology of the Central Artery Project: Highway to the Past\n| publisher=Commonwealth Museum \u2013 Massachusetts Historical Commission \n| year=2008\n| accessdate=April 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:Copp's Hill Burying Grounds Boston Detroit Publishing.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Copp's Hill Burying Ground]], founded 1659]]\nIn 1629, the [[Cambridge Agreement]] was signed in England among the [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].

This influenced every facet of Boston life, and made it imperative that colonists legislate morality as well as enforce marriage, church attendance, education in the Word of God, and the persecution of sinners. One of the  first schools in America, [[Boston Latin School]] (1635), and the first college in America, [[Harvard College]] (1636), were founded shortly after Boston's European settlement.\n[[File:A South-East View of the City of Boston in North America.jpg|thumb|right|''A South-East View of the City of Boston in North America'', printed at [[London]], c. 1730]]\nTown officials in colonial Boston were chosen annually; positions<ref>Robert Francis Seybolt.

By 1679, Boston Baptists were bold enough to open their own meetinghouse, which was promptly closed by colonial authorities. Expansion and innovation in practice and worship characterized the early Baptists despite the restrictions on their religious liberty.<ref>Milton P. Ryder, \"Swimming Against the Current: The Strange Therapy of Persecution; The Price Paid for Religious Liberty by Some Early Massachusetts Baptists and the First Baptist Church of Boston,\" ''American Baptist Quarterly,'' March 2002, Vol. 21 Issue 1, pp 11\u201327</ref> On June 1, 1660, [[Mary Dyer]] was hanged on Boston Common for repeatedly defying a law banning [[Quakers]] from being in the colony.\n\nThe [[Boston Post Road]] connected the city to New York and the major settlements in Central and Western Massachusetts.  The lower route ran near present-day [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] via [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  The upper route, laid out in 1673, left via Boston Neck and followed present-day [[U.S. Route 20]] until around [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts]]. It continued through [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut]].   \n[[File:Bunker Hill Monument and Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|Bunker Hill Monument]]\nFrom 1686 until 1689, Massachusetts and surrounding colonies were united.  This larger province, known as the [[Dominion of New England]], was governed by [[Sir Edmund Andros]], an appointee of [[James II of England|King James II]].  Andros, who supported the [[Church of England]] in a largely Puritan city, grew increasingly unpopular.  On April 18, 1689, he was [[1689 Boston revolt|overthrown due to a brief revolt]].  The Dominion was not reestablished.\n\n===Disasters in the 1700s===\nA particularly virulent sequence of six smallpox outbreaks took place from 1636 to 1698. In 1721\u201322, the most severe epidemic occurred, killing 844 people. Out of a population of 10,500, 5889 caught the disease, 844 (14%) died, and at least 900 fled the city, thereby spreading the virus.<ref>Ballard C. Campbell, ed. ''American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation'' (2008) pp 21\u201322</ref>  Colonists tried to prevent the spread of smallpox by isolation. For the first time in America, [[inoculation]] was tried; it causes a mild form of the disease. Inoculation was itself very controversial because of the threat that the procedure itself could be fatal to 2% of those who were treated, or otherwise spread the disease. It was introduced by [[Zabdiel Boylston]] and [[Cotton Mather]].<ref>Ola Elizabeth Winslow, ''A destroying angel: The conquest of smallpox in colonial Boston'' (1974)</ref>\n\nIn 1755, Boston endured the largest earthquake ever to hit the Northeastern United States, (estimated at 6.0 to 6.3 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]), called the ''[[1755 Cape Ann earthquake|Cape Ann earthquake]]''.

Its merchants avoided the customs duties which angered London officials and led to a crackdown on smuggling. Governor [[Thomas Pownall]] (1757 to 1760) tried to be conciliatory, but his replacement Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]]  (1760\u201369) was a hard-liner who wanted to stamp out the opposition voices that were growing louder and louder in town meetings and pamphlets. Historian Pauline Maier says that his letters to London greatly influenced officials there, but they \"distorted\" reality. \"His misguided conviction that the 'faction' had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition, for example, kept him from recognizing the radicals' peace-keeping efforts....Equally dangerous, Bernard's elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Pauline Maier|title=From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765\u20131776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aQuIbSA19YC&pg=PA151|year=1973|publisher=W.W.

In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day, and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768, \"certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town.\" Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the \"same strain of hysteria.\"<ref>G. B. Warden, ''Boston 1689\u20131776'' (1970) pp 213\u201314</ref> Four thousand British Army troops arrived in Boston in October 1768 as a massive show of force; tensions escalated.\n[[Image:Boston area colonial map.jpg|left|thumb|320px|A map showing Boston and vicinity, including Bunker Hill, Dorchester Heights, and troop disposition of Gen.

Boston played the primary role in sparking both the [[American Revolution]] and the ensuing [[American Revolutionary War]]. The [[Boston Massacre]] came on March 5, 1770, when British soldiers fired into unarmed demonstrators outside the British custom house, resulting in the deaths of five civilians and dramatically escalating tensions.<ref>Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1970)</ref>  Parliament, meanwhile, insisted on its right to tax the Americans and finally came up with a small tax on tea.  Up and down the 13 colonies, Americans prevented merchants from selling the tea, but a shipment arrived in Boston Harbor. On December 16, 1773, 30\u201360 local [[Sons of Liberty]], disguised as Native Americans, dumped 342 chests of tea in the harbor in the [[Boston Tea Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Coming of the American Revolution|url=http://www.masshist.org/revolution/teaparty.php|publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> The Sons of Liberty decided to take action in order to defy Britain's new tax on tea, but the British government retaliated with a series of harsh laws, closing down the Port of Boston and stripping Massachusetts of its self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosa|first=Greg|title=Analyzing the Boston Tea Party|date=2006|publisher=The Rosen group|location=New York}}</ref>  The other colonies rallied in solidarity behind Massachusetts, setting up the [[First Continental Congress]], while arming and training militia units. The British sent more troops to Boston, and made its commander General [[Thomas Gage]] the governor. Gage believed the Patriots were hiding munitions in the town of Concord, and he sent troops to capture them.  [[Paul Revere]], [[William Dawes]], and [[Dr. Samuel Prescott]] made their famous midnight rides to alert the [[Minutemen]] in the surrounding towns, who fought the resulting [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775. It was the first battle of the American Revolution.\n\nMilitia units across New England rallied to the defense of Boston, and Congress sent in General [[George Washington]] to take command.  The British were [[Siege of Boston|trapped in the city]], and suffered very heavy losses in their victory at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. \nWashington brought in artillery and forced the British out as the patriots took full control of Boston. The American victory on March 17, 1776, is celebrated as [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]].

It had become one of the world's wealthiest international trading ports, exporting products like rum, fish, salt and tobacco.<ref>[http://www.universityarchives.com/browse.asp?sn=39159-001&show=True&thumbnails=True University Archives Colonial Boston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207181331/http://www.universityarchives.com/browse.asp?sn=39159-001&show=True&thumbnails=True |date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref>  The upheaval of the American Revolution, and the British naval blockade that shut down its economy, had caused a majority of the population to flee the city. From a base of 10,000 in 1780, the population approached 25,000 by 1800. The abolition of slavery in the state in 1783 gave blacks greater physical mobility, but their social mobility was slow.<ref>Jacqueline Barbara Carr, \"A Change 'as Remarkable as the Revolution Itself': Boston's Demographics, 1780\u20131800,\" ''New England Quarterly,'' Dec 2000, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 583\u2013602</ref>\n\nBoston was part of the New England corner of [[triangular trade]], receiving sugar from the [[Caribbean]] and refining it into [[rum]] and [[molasses]], partly for export to Europe.  Later, [[confectionery]] manufacturing would become another refined product made from similar raw materials.  Related companies with facilities in Boston included the [[Boston Sugar Refinery]] (inventors of [[granulated sugar]]), [[Domino Sugar]], the [[Purity Distilling Company]], [[Necco]], [[Schrafft's]], [[Squirrel Brands]] (as the predecessor Austin T.

The [[Boston Fruit Company]] began importing tropical fruit from the Caribbean in 1885; it is a predecessor of [[United Fruit Company]] and [[Chiquita Brands International]].\n\nBoston had the status of a town; it was [[Boston City Charter|chartered]] as a city in 1822.<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3865.html US History.com, Cities, Boston, Massachusetts]</ref> The second mayor was [[Josiah Quincy III]], who undertook infrastructure improvements in roads and sewers, and organized the city's dock area around the newly erected Faneuil Hall Marketplace, popularly known as Quincy Market. By the mid-19th century Boston was one of the largest manufacturing centers in the nation, noted for its garment production, leather goods, and machinery industries.  Manufacturing overtook international trade to dominate the local economy. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region made for easy shipment of goods and allowed for a proliferation of mills and factories. The building of the [[Middlesex Canal]] extended this small river network to the larger Merrimack River and its mills, including the [[Lowell mills]] and mills on the [[Nashua River]] in [[New Hampshire]].  By the 1850s, an even denser network of railroads (''see also [[List of railroad lines in Massachusetts]]'') facilitated the region's industry and commerce. For example, in 1851, [[Eben Jordan]] and Benjamin L. Marsh opened the [[Jordan Marsh]] [[Department store]] in downtown Boston. Thirty years later William Filene opened his own department store across the street, called [[Filene's]].\n\nSeveral turnpikes were constructed between cities to aid transportation, especially of cattle and sheep to markets. A major east-west route, the Worcester Turnpike (now [[Massachusetts Route 9]]), was constructed in 1810.  Others included the Newburyport Turnpike (now Route 1) and the Salem Lawrence Turnpike (now Route 114).\n\n===Brahmin elite===\nBoston's [[Boston Brahmin|\"Brahmin elite\"]] developed a particular semi-aristocratic value system by the 1840s\u2014cultivated, urbane, and dignified, the ideal Brahmin was the very essence of enlightened aristocracy.<ref>Ronald Story, ''Harvard and the Boston Upper Class: The Forging of an Aristocracy, 1800\u20131970'' (1985).</ref><ref>Paul Goodman, \"Ethics and Enterprise: The Values of a Boston Elite, 1800\u20131860,\" ''American Quarterly,'' Sept 1966, Vol. 18 Issue 3, pp 437\u2013451</ref>  He was not only wealthy, but displayed suitable personal virtues and character traits.  The term was coined in 1861 by Dr. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]<ref>Holmes entitled the first chapter of his 1861 novel ''Elsie Venner'' \"The Brahmin caste of New England\"; he had long been writing about the group without using the term \"Brahmin.\"</ref>  The Brahmin had high expectations to meet: to cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against \"avarice\" and insisted upon \"personal responsibility.\" Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society.  Young men attended the same prep schools and colleges,<ref>Ronald Story, \"Harvard Students, The Boston Elite, And The New England Preparatory System, 1800\u20131870,\" ''History of Education Quarterly,'' Fall 1975, Vol. 15 Issue 3, pp 281\u2013298</ref> and had their own [[Boston Brahmin accent|way of talking]]. Heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belonged to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists.  Politically, they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans.\n\nA poem about Boston, attributed to various people, describes the city thus: \"And here's to good old Boston / The land of the bean and the cod / Where Lowells talk only to Cabots / and Cabots talk only to God.\" While wealthy colonial families like the Lowells and Cabots (often called the ''[[Boston Brahmin]]s'') ruled the city, the 1840s brought waves of new immigrants from Europe. These included large numbers of [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Italy|Italians]], giving the city a large [[Roman Catholic]] population.\n\n===Abolitionists===\n[[Image:Boston-view-1841-Havell.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Boston from [[Dorchester Heights]], 1841.]]\nIn 1831, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] newsletter, in Boston. It advocated \"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves\" in the United States, and established Boston as the center of the abolitionist movement. After the passing of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Boston became a bastion of abolitionist thought. Attempts by slave-catchers to arrest fugitive slaves often proved futile, which included the notable case of [[Anthony Burns]] and Kevin McLaughlin.  After the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Boston also became the hub of efforts to send anti-slavery New Englanders to settle in [[Kansas Territory]] through the [[Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company]].\n\n===Irish===\n[[File:Aerial Boston 1860-10-13.jpg|alt=A black-and-white aerial photo of Boston|thumb|This aerial photo of Boston was taken October 13, 1860 and is the second aerial photo after one of Paris.]]\nThe earliest Irish settlers began arriving in the early 18th century. Initially they were indentured servants who came to work in Boston and New England for five to seven years, before gaining their independence. They were mainly individuals and families, and they were forced to hide their religious roots since Catholicism was banned in the Bay Colony. Then in 1718, congregations of Presbyterians from Ulster in the north of Ireland began arriving in Boston Harbor. They were referred to as Ulster Irish but later were referred to as Scots-Irish because many of them had roots in Scotland. The Puritan leaders initially sent the Ulster Irish to the fringes of the Bay Colony, where they settled places like Belfast, Maine, Londonderry and Derry, New Hampshire, and Worcester, Massachusetts. But by 1729 they were permitted to set up a church in downtown Boston.<ref>[http://globepequot.com/irish_boston_2nd-9780762788347 ''Irish Boston: A Lively Look at Boston's Colorful Irish History'', by Michael Quinlin. Published by Globe Pequot Press, 2013.]</ref>\n\nThroughout the 19th century, Boston became a haven for Irish Catholic immigrants, especially following the [[The Great Hunger|potato famine of 1845\u201349]]. Their arrival transformed Boston from a singular, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city to one that has progressively become more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1850s, an anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant movement was directed against the Irish, called the Know Nothing Party. But in the 1860s, many Irish immigrants joined the Union ranks to fight in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism and valor began to soften the harsh sentiments of Yankees about the Irish.<ref>[[Thomas H. O'Connor]], ''The Boston Irish: A Political History'' (1995) ch 3</ref>\n\nEven to the present day, Boston still commands the largest percentage of Irish-descended people of any city in the United States. With an expanding population, group loyalty, and block by block political organization, the Irish took political control of the city, leaving the Yankees in charge of finance, business and higher education. The Irish left their mark on the region in a number of ways: in still heavily Irish neighborhoods such as [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] and [[South Boston]]; in the name of the local basketball team, the [[Boston Celtics]]; in the dominant Irish-American political family, the [[Kennedys]]; in a large number of prominent local politicians, such as [[James Michael Curley]]; in the establishment of Catholic [[Boston College]] as a rival to [[Harvard]]; and in underworld figures such as [[James \"Whitey\" Bulger]].<ref>O'Connor, ''The Boston Irish: A Political History'' (1995) ch 9</ref>\n\n===Great Fire of 1872===\nThe [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] started at the corner of Summer Street and Kingston Street on November 9. In two days the conflagration destroyed about 65 acres (260,000 m\u00b2) of the city, including 776 buildings in the [[Financial District (Boston, Massachusetts)|financial district]], totaling $60 million in damage.\n\n[[Image:Scollay1880s.jpg|thumb|left|Scollay Square, Boston, in the 1880s.]]\n[[Image:Boston ground 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Map showing all ground in Boston occupied by buildings in 1880. From [[U.S. Census Bureau]].]]\n\n===High culture===\n[[File:19th_century_idealized_illustration_of_Copley_Square,_Boston.jpg|right|thumb|Idealized illustration of [[Copley Square]] from an 1890s clothing catalog, prominently featuring [[H. H. Richardson]]'s [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]]]]\nFrom the mid-to-late-19th century, the Boston Brahmins flourished culturally\u2014they became renowned for its rarefied literary culture and lavish artistic patronage. Literary residents included, among many others, writers [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Julia Ward Howe]], as well as historians [[John Lothrop Motley]], [[John Gorham Palfrey]], [[George Bancroft]], [[William Hickling Prescott]],  [[Francis Parkman]], [[Henry Adams]], [[James Ford Rhodes]], [[Edward Channing]] and [[Samuel Eliot Morison]]. Also there were theologians and philosophers such as [[William Ellery Channing]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Mary Baker Eddy]]. When [[Bret Harte]] visited Howells, he remarked that in Boston \"it was impossible to fire a revolver without bringing down the author of a two-volume work.\" Boston had many great publishers and magazines, such as ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' (founded 1857) and the publishers [[Little, Brown and Company]], [[Houghton Mifflin]], and [[Harvard University Press]].<ref>Van Wyck Brooks, ''The flowering of New England'' (1955)</ref>\n\nHigher education became increasingly important, principally at Harvard (based across the river in Cambridge), but also at other institutions. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) opened in the city in 1865. The first medical school for women, The Boston Female Medical School (which later merged with the [[Boston University]] School of Medicine), opened in Boston on November 1, 1848. The Jesuits opened [[Boston College]] in 1863; [[Emerson College]] opened in 1880, and [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]] for women in 1899.\n\nThe Brahmins were the foremost authors and audiences of high culture, despite being a minority. Emerging Irish, Jewish, and Italian cultures made little to no impact on the elite.<ref>{{cite book|author=E. Digby Baltzell|title=Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ZL0-hg2owC&pg=PA286|year=1979|publisher=Transaction Publishers|pages=286, 430|isbn=9781412832571}}</ref>\n\nTo please a different audience, the first [[vaudeville]] theater opened on February 28, 1883, in Boston. The last one, the Old Howard in [[Scollay Square]], which had evolved from opera to vaudeville to burlesque, closed in 1953.\n\nThe public Boston Museum of Natural History (founded in 1830 and renamed the New England Museum of Natural History in 1864, and the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston Museum of Science]] in the mid-twentieth century), was run by the Boston Society of Natural History.  It served the function of public and professional education in natural history, including ocean life, geology and mineralogy.  Around the end of the 19th century a scientific library and children's rooms were added.  In addition, the private Warren Museum of Natural History at Boston operated 1858\u20131906. It was acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 1906.<ref>Paul DiMaggio, Paul. \"Cultural entrepreneurship in nineteenth-century Boston.\" in Chandra Mukerji and Mich\u00e6l Schudson, eds, ''Rethinking Popular Culture: Contemporary Perspectives in Cultural Studies'' (1991) pp 374+.</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\nAs the population increased rapidly, [[Boston-area streetcar lines]] facilitated the creation of a profusion of [[streetcar suburbs]].  Middle-class businessmen, office workers and professionals lived in the suburbs and commuted into the city by subway.<ref>Sam Bass Warner, ''Streetcar suburbs'' (1978).</ref>  Downtown congestion worsened, prompting the opening of the first [[Subway (rail)|subway]] in North America on September 1, 1897, the [[Tremont Street Subway]]. Between 1897 and 1912, subterranean rail links were built to Cambridge and East Boston, and elevated and underground lines expanded into other neighborhoods from downtown. Today, the regional passenger rail and bus network has been consolidated into the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. Two union stations, [[North Station (Boston)|North Station]] and [[South Station, Boston|South Station]] were constructed to consolidate downtown railroad terminals.\n\n===Censorship===\nFrom the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, the phrase \"[[Banned in Boston]]\" was used to describe a literary work, motion picture, or play prohibited from distribution or exhibition. During this time, Boston city officials took it upon themselves to \"ban\" anything that they found to be salacious, immoral, or offensive: theatrical shows were run out of town, books confiscated, and motion pictures were prevented from being shown\u2014sometimes stopped in mid-showing after an official had \"seen enough\".  The phrase \"banned in Boston\" came to suggest something sexy and lurid; some distributors advertised that their products had been banned in Boston, when in fact they had not.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Twentieth century Boston (2674949807).jpg|thumb|1905]]\n[[File:1917 Boston Index Card Co byLewisHine 1.jpg|thumb|right|Child labor in Boston, 1917.

Extending her role as teacher and mother she became an ethnic spokesperson as she confronted the power of the Yankee Protestant men of the Public School Association. She worked to replace 37-year-old textbooks, to protect the claims of local Boston women for career opportunities in the school system, and to propose a degree-granting teachers college. In 1905, the 25 member committee was reduced to five, which blocked women's opportunities for direct participation in school policies.<ref>Polly Welts Kaufman, \"Julia Harrington Duff: An Irish Woman Confronts the Boston Power Structure, 1900\u20131905,\" ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'',  1990 18(2): 113\u2013137, 25p.

Twenty-one people were killed and 150 injured as an immense wave of molasses, which rushed through the streets at an estimated {{convert|35|mph}}, crushed and asphyxiated many of the victims to death. It took over six months to remove the molasses from the cobblestone streets, theaters, businesses, automobiles, and homes.

Boston fell prey to several riots as there were minimal law officers to maintain order in the city. [[Calvin Coolidge]], then governor of Massachusetts, garnered national fame for quelling violence by almost entirely replacing the police force. The [[Boston Police Strike|1919 Boston Police Strike]] would ultimately set precedent for police unionization across the country.\n\nOn August 23, 1927, Italian [[anarchists]] [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] were sent to the electric chair after a seven-year trial in Boston. Their execution sparked riots in London, Paris and Germany, and helped to reinforce the image of Boston as a hotbed of intolerance and discipline.\n\n===Mid-century transportation and urban renewal===\n[[File:Old John Hancock Tower and the Boston skyline in summer of 1956.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Berkeley Building|Old John Hancock Tower]] and Boston skyline, as it appeared in 1956]]\n[[Image:Boston, Massachusetts 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|1955 Yellow Book plan for the Boston-area highway system.]] The [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|I-695 Inner Belt]] shown on this map was never built. [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] is shown here approaching the urban core from the southwest, but it was never built beyond the outer loop shown on this map (which was built as [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] and which I-95 was later re-routed over).\n\nIn 1934, the [[Sumner Tunnel]] created the first direct road connection under Boston Harbor, between the [[North End, Boston|North End]] and [[East Boston]].\n\nIn May 1938, the first public housing project, [[Old Harbor Housing Project|Old Harbor Village]] was opened in [[South Boston]].<ref>Vale, Lawrence J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=D855PFwzHzoC&printsec=frontcover ''From the Puritans to the projects: public housing and public neighbors''], Harvard University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nBy 1950, Boston was slumping. Few major buildings were being built anywhere in the city. Factories were closing and moving their operations south, where labor was cheaper. The assets Boston had\u2014excellent banks, hospitals, universities and technical know-how\u2014were minimal parts of the U.S. economy. To combat this downturn, Boston's politicians enacted [[urban renewal]] policies, which resulted in the demolition of several neighborhoods, including the New York Streets district in the [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]], the [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|old West End]], a largely [[Jewish]] and [[Italian-American|Italian]] neighborhood, and [[Scollay Square]]. In their places went a new headquarters for the [[Boston Herald]], the Charles River Park apartment complex, additions to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], and [[Scollay Square|Government Center]]. These projects displaced thousands, closed hundreds of businesses, and provoked a furious backlash, which in turn ensured the survival of many historic neighborhoods.\n\nIn 1948, [[William F. Callahan]] had published the Master Highway Plan for Metropolitan Boston. Parts of the financial district, Chinatown, and the North End were demolished to make way for construction. By 1956, the northern part of the [[Central Artery]] had been constructed, but strong local opposition resulted in the southern downtown portion being built underground. The [[Dewey Square Tunnel]] connected downtown to the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]]. In 1961, the [[Callahan Tunnel]] opened, paralleling the older Sumner Tunnel.\n\nBy 1965, the first [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] Extension was completed from Route 128 to near [[South Station (Boston)|South Station]]. The proposed [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, and Somerville was canceled due to public outcry. <!-- not sure when, exactly --> In 1971, public protest canceled the routing of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] into downtown Boston. Demolition had already begun along the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]], which was instead used to re-route the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\n===World War II and later===\nOn November 28, 1942, Boston's Cocoanut Grove [[nightclub]] was the site of the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]], the deadliest nightclub fire in United States history, killing 492 people and injuring hundreds more.\n\nDuring the war years, antisemitic violence escalated in Boston. Gangs largely composed of Irish Catholic youths desecrated Jewish cemeteries and synagogues, vandalized Jewish stores and homes, and physically assaulted Jews in the streets. The Boston police force, which was made up largely of Irish Catholics, seldom intervened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Norwood | first1 = Stephen H. | year =2003 | title = Marauding Youth and the Christian Front: Antisemitic Violence in Boston and New York during World War II | url = | journal = American Jewish History | volume =  91 | issue  = 2| pages = 233\u2013267 | doi = 10.1353/ajh.2004.0055 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the [[Great Brink's Robbery]] was committed; at the time it was the largest bank robbery in the United States, with the thieves stealing $2.775 million.\n\nIn 1953, the [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing projects were completed on the Dorchester peninsula. There were 1,502 units in the development on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land. In 1966, the Columbia Point Health Center opened and was the first community health center in the country.\n\nBetween June 14, 1962, and January 4, 1964, as many as thirteen single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in Boston by the infamous [[The Boston Strangler|Boston Strangler]]. (The actual number remains in dispute.)\n\n[[Image:Boston Back Bay.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Aerial view of the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] ]]\nIn the 1970s, after years of economic downturn, Boston boomed again. Financial institutions were granted more latitude, more people began to play the market, and Boston became a leader in the [[mutual fund]] industry. Health care became more extensive and expensive, and hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] led the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Higher education also became more expensive, and universities such as [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Boston College]], [[Boston University|BU]] and [[Tufts University|Tufts]] attracted hordes of students to the Boston area; many stayed and became permanent residents. MIT graduates, in particular, founded many successful [[high-tech]] companies, which made Boston second only to [[Silicon Valley]] as a high-tech center.\n\nIn 1974, the city [[Boston busing crisis|dealt with a crisis]] when a federal district court judge, W. Arthur Garrity, ordered [[desegregation busing]] to integrate the city's public schools. Racially motivated violence erupted in several neighborhoods (many white parents resisted the busing plan). Public schools\u2014particularly public high schools\u2014became scenes of unrest and violence. Tension continued throughout the mid-1970s, reinforcing Boston's reputation for discrimination. A famous photograph, ''[[The Soiling of Old Glory]]'', was taken in front of Boston City Hall, viscerally depicting the conflict.\n\nThe Columbia Point housing complex deteriorated until only 350 families remained living there in 1988.   In 1984, the city of Boston gave control of the complex to a private developer, Corcoran-Mullins-Jennison, who re-developed and re-vitalised the property into a residential mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments.  It is a very significant example of revitalisation and re-development and was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, [[mixed-income housing]] in the USA. Harbor Point has won much acclaim for this transformation, including awards from the [[Urban Land Institute]], the [[FIABCI]] Award for International Excellence, and the [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]].<ref name=\"Bruner Foundation\">{{cite web|title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba|publisher=Bruner Foundation|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>Kamin, Blair.

Twelve paintings, collectively worth over $100 million, were stolen from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] by two thieves posing as police officers. The paintings were not recovered.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Big Dig and public transit in the 2000s===\n[[Image:FleetCenterAndZakimBridge20040729.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Boston's Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge is a result of the Big Dig.]]\nIn 2007, the Central Artery/Tunnel project was completed. Nicknamed the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]], it had been planned and approved in the 1980s under Massachusetts governor [[Michael Dukakis]]. With construction beginning in 1991, the Big Dig moved the remainder of the Central Artery underground, widened the north-south highway, and created local bypasses to prevent east-west traffic from contributing to congestion. The [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] became the third highway tunnel to East Boston and [[Logan International Airport]] as part of the project. The Big Dig also produced the landmark [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]], and will create over 70 acres (280,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of public parks in the heart of the city. The project as a whole has eased (but not eliminated) Boston's notorious traffic congestion; however, it is the most expensive construction project in United States history and the [[List of megaprojects|most expensive construction project]] in the world.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Susan Moir (University of Massachusetts Lowell) | title=Big Dig | journal=Electronic Library of Construction \u2013 Occupational Safety and Health (CDC) | url=http://www.elcosh.org/docs/d0100/d000067/d000067.html}}</ref>\n <!---really needs dollars here someplace. Hard to believe this exceeds, in current dollars, the chunnel under the English channel--->\n\nThe city also saw other transportation projects, including improvement and expansion to its mass transit system, notably to its commuter rail system to southeastern Massachusetts and the development of a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system dubbed \"The Silver Line.\" The maritime [[Port of Boston]] and [[Logan International Airport]] were also developed.\n\n==21st century==\n[[Image:Boston20040307-03.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Downtown Boston as seen from Cambridge]]\nRecently, Boston has experienced a loss of regional institutions and traditions, which once gave it a very distinct social character, as it has become part of the [[Northeast megalopolis|northeastern megalopolis]]. Examples include: the acquisition of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' by ''[[The New York Times]]''; the loss of Boston-headquartered publishing houses (noted above); the acquisition of the century-old Jordan Marsh department store by [[Macy's]]; and the loss to mergers, failures, and acquisitions of once-prominent financial institutions such as Shawmut Bank, BayBank, Bank of New England, and Bank of Boston. In 2004, this trend continued as [[Charlotte]]-based [[Bank of America]] acquired [[FleetBoston Financial]], and [[P&G]] has announced plans to acquire [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]].\n\nDespite these losses, Boston's ambiance remains unique among [[Global city|world cities]] and, in many ways, has improved in recent years\u2014racial tensions have eased dramatically, city streets bustle with a vitality not seen since the 1920s, and once again Boston has become a hub of intellectual, technological, and political ideas. Nevertheless, the city had to tackle [[gentrification]] issues and rising living expenses. According to ''Money Magazine'', Boston is one of the world's 100 most expensive cities.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2005/06/21/pf/costliest_cities/ \"World's most expensive cities.\" ''Money Magazine'']. Accessed June 30, 2005.</ref>\n\nBoston was the host city of the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. The city also found itself at the center of national attention in early 2004 during the controversy over [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|same-sex marriage]]s. After the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled that such marriages cannot be banned under the state's constitution, opponents and supporters of such marriages converged on the [[Massachusetts State House]] as the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]] voted on a state constitutional amendment that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman. Much attention was focused on the city and the rest of Massachusetts when marriage licenses for same-sex couples were issued.\n\nAlso in [[2004 World Series|2004]], the [[Boston Red Sox]] won their first [[World Series]] in 86 years, following it up three years later with a victory in [[2007 World Series|2007]], another in [[2013 World Series|2013]], and another World Series win in [[2018 World Series|2018]]. Boston sports continue to dominate.\n\nOn April 15, 2013, [[Boston Marathon bombings|two bombs were detonated]] during the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring hundreds.\n\nOn August 20, 2017 the [[.boston]] top-level internet domain ([[GeoTLD]]) officially started taking registrations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bray |first1=Hiawatha |date=August 10, 2017 |title=The dot-Boston domain is now open |trans-title= |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/08/10/the-dot-boston-domain-now-open/06SU5Q82wWHMTW51ZfwoJO/story.html |access-date=February 18, 2018 |url-access=subscription  |quote=The .boston domain was initially awarded to the city of Boston and the Boston Globe in 2012, but the media company sold off nearly all its interests in the venture to Minds + Machines Group Limited, a company specializing in the operation of Internet domains.

Beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a {{convert|50|acre|ha|adj=on}} mill pond that later became the [[Bulfinch Triangle Historic District|Bulfinch Triangle]] (just south of today's North Station area). The present-day [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] sits atop this shortened Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the areas now known as the South End, West End, Financial District, and Chinatown. After [[Great Boston Fire of 1872|The Great Boston Fire of 1872]], building rubble was used as landfill along the downtown waterfront.\n\nThe most dramatic reclamation project was the filling in of the Back Bay in the mid to late 19th century. Almost six hundred acres (240 hectares) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of the Boston Common were filled in with gravel brought in by rail from the hills of [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham Heights]].\n\nBoston also grew by annexing the adjacent communities of [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] (including [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]] and [[Roslindale, Massachusetts|Roslindale]]), [[South Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]], [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[Allston, Boston, Massachusetts|Allston]], [[Hyde Park, Boston, Massachusetts|Hyde Park]], and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], some of which were also augmented by landfill reclamation. Several proposals to regionalize municipal government failed due to concerns about loss of local control, corruption, and Irish immigration, including:<ref>{{cite news|agency=Boston Globe|title=Welcome to Megaboston|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/01/22/welcome-megaboston/nYTuQFpRryVrd8i35yFjsL/story.html#|date=January 22, 2012|accessdate=January 22, 2012|author=Chris Marstall}}</ref>\n* 1896 \u2013 \"County of Boston\" proposal in the state legislature\n* 1910 \u2013 \"Real Boston\" proposal by Edward Filene to create a regional advisory board\n* 1912 \u2013 \"Greater Boston\" proposal by Daniel J.
