She heard the voice of Tem\u00fcjin and, recognizing it, she got off the cart and came running towards him. Although it was still night, Lady B\u00f6rte and Qo\u2019aq\u010din both recognized Tem\u00fcjin\u2019s reins and tether and grabbed them.

This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions.

I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book\n| last       = Morgan\n| first       = David\n| author-link = David Morgan (historian)\n| title       = The Mongols.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants. Genghis Khan had left [[Muqali]], one of his most trusted generals, in command of all Mongol forces in Jin China while he battled the Khwarezmid Empire to the west.\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n[[File:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|right|Genghis Khan (center) at the coronation of his son \u00d6gedei, ''[[Rashid al-Din]]'', early 14th century]]\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.\n\n== Mongol Empire ==\n{{Main|Mongol Empire}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]-->\n\n=== Politics and economics ===\n{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}\n\n[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]] 1206\u20131294.]]\n\nThe Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

The name would imply a blacksmith or a man strong like iron.\n\nNo evidence has survived to indicate that Genghis Khan had any exceptional training or reputation as a blacksmith.

This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him. Qiu Chuji died in Beijing the same year as Genghis Khan and his shrine became the [[White Cloud Temple]]. Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present. Kublai Khan had already met Haiyun in 1242 and been swayed towards Buddhism.<ref>Page 14-19, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>\n\nGenghis Khan's decree exempting Daoists (''xiansheng''), Buddhists (''toyin''), Christians (''erke'\u00fcd'') and Muslims (''dashmad'') from tax duties were continued by his successors until the end of the Yuan dynasty in 1368.

However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants. Genghis Khan had left [[Muqali]], one of his most trusted generals, in command of all Mongol forces in Jin China while he battled the Khwarezmid Empire to the west.\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n[[File:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|right|Genghis Khan (center) at the coronation of his son \u00d6gedei, ''[[Rashid al-Din]]'', early 14th century]]\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops. It was taken through Communist-held territory in [[Yan'an]] some {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.\n\n== Mongol Empire ==\n{{Main|Mongol Empire}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]-->\n\n=== Politics and economics ===\n{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}\n\n[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]] 1206\u20131294.]]\n\nThe Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

But the latter interpretation (a man strong like iron) is supported by the names of Genghis Khan's siblings, Tem\u00fclin and Tem\u00fcge, which are derived from the same root word.\n\n=== Name and spelling variations ===\n<!-- This section is linked from 'Genghis Khan' -->\nGenghis Khan is spelled in a variety of ways in different languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] Chinggis Khaan, English ''Chinghiz'', ''Chinghis'', and ''Chingiz'', {{zh|c=\u6210\u5409\u601d\u6c57|p=Ch\u00e9ngj\u00eds\u012b H\u00e1n}}, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: ''Cengiz Han'', ''\u00c7ingiz Xan'', ''Chingizxon'', ''Sh\u0131n'g'\u0131sxan'', ''\u00c7ingiz Han'' ''\u00c7\u0131\u00f1\u011f\u0131z Xan'', ''\u015e\u0131\u00f1\u011f\u0131s xan'', ''\u00c7i\u00f1\u011fiz Xaan'', ''\u00c7i\u00f1\u011fizhan'', [[Russian languages|Russian]]: \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0445\u0430\u043d (''\u010cingiskhan'') or \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0437-\u0445\u0430\u043d (''\u010cingiz-khan''), etc. Tem\u00fcjin is written in Chinese as {{zh|s=\u94c1\u6728\u771f|t=\u9435\u6728\u771e|p=Ti\u011bm\u00f9zh\u0113n}}.\n\nWhen [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271, he had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or ''Taizu'' ({{zh|\u592a\u7956|T\u00e0iz\u01d4}}).

Founded as an explicitly liberal group, it expanded its remit to cover the different traditions of each new Member State as they acceded to the [[European Union|Union]], progressively changing its name in the process. Its immediate predecessor was the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Group]] (ELDR).\n\nThe ALDE Group was the fourth-largest group in the [[Eighth European Parliament]] term, and previously participated in the Grand Coalition (the coalition designed to provide a majority) during the [[Sixth European Parliament|Sixth Parliament]] (2004\u20132009). The [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] platform of ALDE was in support of [[Free market|free market economics]] and pushed for [[European integration]] and the [[Internal market|European single market]].<ref name=\"PhinnemoreMcGowan2013\">{{cite book|author1=David Phinnemore|author2=Lee McGowan|title=A Dictionary of the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9EB7e8pgywC&pg=PA277|accessdate=7 August 2013|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-08127-0|page=277}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 2019 it was announced that the successor group in alliance with [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]] would be named [[Renew Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-liberal-alliance-to-be-named-renew-europe/|title=Macron-Liberal alliance to be named Renew Europe|last=Baume|first=Ma\u00efa de La|date=2019-06-12|website=POLITICO|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref><ref>https://euobserver.com/tickers/145134</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Guy_Verhofstadt_in_2005.jpg|thumb|[[Guy Verhofstadt]]]]\n\nThe ALDE Group traced its unofficial ancestry back to the Liberal members present at the first meeting of the Common Assembly of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (the Parliament's predecessor) on 10 September 1952,<ref name=\"ENA9892\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/composition_of_the_common_assembly_10_13_september_1952-en-5dd0109a-0c6f-47a3-833a-1c482b599a89.html |title=Composition of the Common Assembly (10\u201313 September 1952) |publisher=CVCE|accessdate=2013-04-28}}</ref> but the Group was officially founded as the Group of Liberals and Allies<ref name=\"t1s9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/alliance-des-democrates-et-des-liberaux-pour-l-europe.htm |title=ALDE on Europe Politique |publisher=Europe-politique.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> on 23 June 1953.<ref name=\"t1s9\"/>\n\nAs the Assembly grew into the Parliament, the French [[Gaullist Party|Gaullists]] split from the Group on 21 January 1965<ref name=\"t1s8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/rassemblement-des-democrates-europeens.htm |title=UFE on Europe Politique |publisher=Europe-politique.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> and the Group started the process of changing its name to match the liberal/centrist traditions of the new member states, firstly to the Liberal and Democratic Group<ref name=\"t1s9\"/><ref name=\"t1s2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.4504/ |title=Political Groups of the European Parliament |publisher=Kas.de |accessdate=2010-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517163147/http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.4504/ |archivedate=2011-05-17 }}</ref> in 1976,<ref name=\"t1s9\"/> then to the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group<ref name=\"t1s45\">{{EP MEP info/archive|1174|Simone Veil}}</ref> on 13 December 1985,<ref name=\"t1s9\"/> then to the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (European Parliament group)|Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]<ref name=\"t1s9\"/><ref name=\"t1s2\"/><ref name=\"t1s6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/results/legende.htm |title=Group names 1999 |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> on 19 July 1994<ref name=\"t1s9\"/> to match the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|European political party of the same name]].\n\nIn 1999, the Group partnered with [[European People's Party group|European People's Party\u2013European Democrats]] (EPP-ED) group to form the [[Grand Coalition]] for the Fifth Parliament. The customary split of the Presidency of the European Parliament between Groups in the Coalition meant that the Group achieved its first [[President of the European Parliament]] on 15 January 2002, when [[Pat Cox]] was elected to the post to serve the latter half of the five-year term. The Group lost its Grand Coalition status after the 2004 elections.\n\nOn 13 July 2004, the Group approved a recommendation to unite with [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from the centrist [[European political party|political party at the European level]] called the [[European Democratic Party]] (EDP) founded by [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]]'s [[Union for French Democracy]], the [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Labour Party]] of Lithuania and [[Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy]] of Italy.\n\nThe Group accordingly became the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe<ref name=\"t1s9\"/> (ALDE) on 20 July 2004,<ref name=\"t1s9\"/> to match the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|eponymous transnational political alliance]], although the two European-level parties remained separate outside the European Parliament. The MEP [[Graham Watson]] of the British [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] became the first chair of ALDE.\n\nIn May 2019, speaking at a debate leading up to the [[2019 European Parliament election]], ALDE President Guy Verhofstadt announced that following the election, the group intended to dissolve and form a new, centrist alliance with Emmanuel Macron's \"Renaissance\"
