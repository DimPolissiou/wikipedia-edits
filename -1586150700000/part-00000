The barley is dried in a closed [[kiln]] fired by natural gas (formerly [[anthracite]] coal).

The Jameson brand was acquired by the French drinks conglomerate [[Pernod Ricard]] in 1988 when it bought [[Irish Distillers]]. The old Jameson Distillery in Bow Street near Smithfield in Dublin now serves as a museum which offers tours and tastings. The distillery, which is historical in nature and no longer produces whiskey on site, went through a $12.6 million renovation that was concluded in March 2016, and is now a focal part of Ireland's strategy to raise the number of whiskey tourists, which stood at 600,000 in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-businessreport.com/article/jameson-distillery-triple-whiskey-tourists/ |title=Re-opened Jameson Distillery part of plan to triple whiskey tourists |publisher=The Business Report  |date=January 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/ie/tours/|title=Welcome to the Home of Jameson Whiskey|accessdate=2014-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507001319/http://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/ie/tours/|archive-date=7 May 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bow Street also now has a fully functioning Maturation Warehouse within its walls since the 2016 renovation.

[[barley]], all sourced from within a fifty-mile radius around the distillery in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. The barley is dried in a closed [[kiln]] fired by natural gas (formerly [[anthracite]] coal). This is in contrast to the traditional method used in some Scotch whisky distilleries, which fire the kiln with peat, adding a distinctive peat flavour.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stuart|first1=McNamara|title=A Beginners Guide to How Irish Whiskey is Made.|url=http://irishwhiskey.com/a-beginners-guide-to-how-irish-whiskey-is-made/|website=IrishWhiskey.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nJameson products \u2013 in particular its 18-Year and its Rarest Reserve \u2013 have rated very highly at international [[spirit ratings]] competitions.

various low-cost alternative ventilation devices or adaptations.\n\nAnaesthetist Dr. Alan Gauthier from [[Ontario]], Canada, turned one single-patient ventilator into a nine-patient device thanks to a 2006 YouTube video by 2 doctors from Detroit.<ref name=\":4\" /> The method uses T-shaped tubes to split airflow and multiply the number of patients provided with respiratory support.\n\nIn Ireland,

devices.<ref name=\":6\" /> The valves supplier was itself out of stock leading to patient deaths.<ref name=\":6\" /> Vallini contacted [[Fab lab|FabLab]] founder Massimo Temporelli, which invited Michele Faini, an expert in 3D print manufacturing and a research and development designer at Lonati SpA to join a 3D printing effort.<ref name=\":6\" /> When the supplier didn't wish to share the design's specifics, they reverse-engineered the valves and produced a limited not-for-profit series for local hospitals.<ref name=\":6\" /> To satisfy biomedical requirements that can withstand periodic sanitation, Lonati SpA used their SLS 3D printers to print about 100 valves in [[Nylon 12|Nylon PA12]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Faini and Temporelli still acknowledge the limitations of their production: 3D printing not being able to reach the quality and sterilised context of the original valves and manufacturing process.<ref name=\":6\" /> Contrary to rumours online, the valves don't cost {{usd|10,000}} each and the original manufacturer did not threaten to sue the 3D printers team.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nHackers of the ''Ventilator Project'' have brainstormed to propose to re-purposing [[CPAP machine]]s (sleep-apnea masks) as ventilators, hacking single ventilators to split air-flow and treat multiple patients, and using grounded aircraft as treatment facilities to

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE).  The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staffs.<ref name=\"20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE).  The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staffs.<ref name=20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.
