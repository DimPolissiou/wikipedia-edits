Cal.)) is the name of a  against  of  by the  and was handled by the  . This is the first  related prosecution in U.S history.\n\n==Case summary==\n\nAncheta violated the prohibited acts of accessing and transmitting malware with the intent and consequence of disrupting interstate and foreign commerce. The case was the first prosecution in the [[United States of America]] where an individual was sentenced to prison for profiting from the use of botnets that were used maliciously to launch destructive [[denial of service]] attacks and sending of large quantities of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] across the internet. The 57-month prison sentence for Ancheta was the longest in history for a defendant who has spread [[malware]].\n\nAncheta pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate to the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] causing damage to computers used by the [[federal government of the United States]] in national defence and accessing a [[protected computer]] without authorization for the purpose of commit various types of fraud. Between the dates of June 25, 2004 and September 15, 2004 in [[Los Angeles]] county Ancheta and others knowingly conspired to violate {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}, {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|i}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}} of [[US Code]].  This refers to knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code or command and as a result of such conduct cause damage without authorization to a computer used in interstate and foreign commerce and communication and cause loss during a one-year period aggregating at least $5000 in value. Secondly Acheta and others conspired to violate {{uscsub|18|1037|a|1}}, {{uscsub|18|1037|b|2|A}}, and {{uscsub|18|1037|b|2|F}} of US Code.  This refers to access without authorization a computer used in interstate and foreign commerce and communication, and intentionally intimate the transmission from and through that computer multiple commercial electronic email messages that affect interstate and foreign commerce.  Finally Ancheta was charged for laundering of monetary instruments under {{uscsub|18|1956|a|1|A|i}} and faced criminal forfeiture under {{uscsub|18|982}} and {{uscsub|21|853}}.\n\n==Case technical details==\n\n===Internet bots and botnets===\n[[Jeanson James Ancheta]] at the time of this crime was a 20-year-old high school drop-out. He found the [[rxbot]] software online and decided that he was going to use it to create a botnet army.  Once established, he set up a [[website]] where he would rent his [[computer zombie]]s to hackers so that they could employ them to fulfill whatever malicious job they had planned. Ancheta used at least one computer system at his place of residence and accessed the Internet from a [[dial up]] telephone line to configure and command the botnet and conduct any business communication.  A co-conspirator residing in [[Boca Raton, Florida]] referred to as SoBE was also involved, as he had previous experience launching computer attacks.\n\nAn [[internet bot]] is a program that infects a computer and enables remote control of that computer.<ref>{{cite web |title=Botnet (Zombie Army)|publisher=TechTarget|date = December 2004| url =http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/botnet}}</ref> A security vulnerability in the computer system is exploited by the hacker in order to install and run the malware; in this case a worm. The program installs itself and is set up to run as a background process or [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] which remains undetectable to the computer user.  The infected computer is often referred to as a [[zombie computer]] and was what Ancheta depended on as the building block of his botnet army.  Ancheta engaged these computers to function in unison in a network formation; this is referred to as a botnet and the controller is called the [[bot herder]]. Ancheta's primary purpose of engaging large numbers of computers was to amplify the attack and reduce the time taken to execute it.  Their greatest value is they provide a relatively high level of anonymity.<ref>{{cite web|last=McMillian|first=Robert|title=Zombie Armies Attack British PCs| publisher=PCWorld|date=September 19, 2005|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/122598/zombie_armies_attack_british_pcs.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in conjunction with 35 government agencies organized an initiative to encourage [[Internet service providers]] to actively monitor, identify and [[quarantine]] customers whose computers appeared to have been compromised, transformed into zombies, or appear to be under the remote control of hackers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leyden|first=John|title=ISPs urged to throttle spam zombies|publisher=The Register|date=May 24, 2005|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/24/operation_spam_zombie/}}</ref> One of the largest botnet implementations around that time (2005) was found by Dutch Police where a botnet of over 1.5 million computers was under a crime ring's control.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanders|first=Tom|title=Botnet operation controlled 1.5m PCs| publisher=Incisive Media|date=October 21, 2005|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/1944019/botnet-operation-controlled-15m-pcs}}</ref>  These zombie computers were often employed as a response to anti-spam laws and spam filtering.

Ancheta developed a [[computer worm]] which when installed and executed would report back to the IRC channel he controlled, scan for other computers with similar vulnerabilities, and leave itself open itself up for future unauthorized control.  Ancheta initially developed this worm by modifying an existing [[Trojan virus|Trojan]] called [[rxbot]].  While DDOS attacks were one use case for these botnets, another major purpose was to use them as a [[proxy server]] for [[email spam]] propagation. In 2004 it was reported that unsolicited email had doubled from late 2003, rising from 310 billion message to 700 billion messages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Tiernan|title=E-Mail viruses blamed as spam rises sharply| publisher=The Seattle Times|date=February 18, 2004|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001859752_spamdoubles18.html}}</ref> Worms like Conficker originally found in 2008 still remain a threat and is significantly more sophisticated, disallowing updates and communicated through encrypted channels.<ref>{{cite web|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|title=Years-old Confiker Worm Still A Threat| publisher=IBTimes|date=January 27, 2001|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/105943/20110127/conficker-worm-still-threat.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Profiting===\nAncheta advertised the sale of bots for the purpose of launching [[denial-of-service attack|distributed denial-of-service]] (DDoS) attacks or to send [[email spam|spam]].  He sold access to the bots in clusters, usually up to 10,000 at a time.  Ancheta acted as a consultant and advised the buyer on the exact number of bots they would need to successfully accomplish the designated attack. He would offer separate channels for an additional cost to assist in the control and direction of the bots, providing temporary control over the channel to the buyer.  Around the time of this crime, it was estimated that an average botnet was 20,000 computers in size.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=Lee|title=Hackers Strengthen Malicious Botnets By Shrinking Them|journal=Computer|issue=April 2006|pages=19|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=April 2006|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2006/04/r4017.pdf|doi=10.1109/MC.2006.136|volume=39}}</ref>  He also profited from sale of the developed worm which he would configure for best propagation.  Buyers also had the option of using their own malware to launch the attack and not use the worm he was offering.  Ancheta accepted all payments through [[PayPal]], where he would misleadingly describe the nature of the transaction as hosting, [[web hosting]], or dedicated box services.\n\n==Case legal details==\n\nIn total there were 17 different counts in this case.\n\n===Conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud a US agency===\nCount 1 was in violation of {{uscsub|18|371}}.  This refers to the conspiracy between Ancheta and others to commit an offense or to defraud a US agency. This violated {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}, {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|i}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}} of [[US Code]].\n\n===Fraud and related activity in connection with computers===\nCounts 2 through 11 were in violation of {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}, {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|v}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}}\n\nCounts 2, 3 and 4 involved intentionally causing damage while accessing an unauthorized computer belonging to King Pao Electronic Co and Sanyo Electric Software which if completed would have caused damage exceeding $5000 and launching a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack to a company (whose name remains confidential) which if completed would have caused damage exceeding $5000.  In furtherance of the conspiracy Ancheta committed various overt acts, including payments to accomplices, directing numerous computers to [[adware]] servers controlled by Ancheta himself.  These servers were where unsuspecting users would be redirected to download the [[malware]]. Counts 5 and 6 included knowingly causing the transmission of malicious code to protected computers belonging to the [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]] and the US [[Defense Information Systems Agency]];  both used for justice, national defence, and national security.  NAWS China Lake is a major Navy research, testing and evaluation facility and DISA provides IT and communication support the President and other top executive staff of the US Government.\n\nCount 7 through 11 were in violation of {{uscsub|18|1030|a|4}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}}. Ancheta knowingly accessed without authorization, computers involved in interstate and foreign commerce by installing adware without notice,  or consent with the sole intent to defraud.  Between 8,744 and 53,321 computers (different for each count) were accessed without authorization and monetary amounts between  $1306.52 and 7966.10 (different for each count) accepted as payment for services.\n\n===Laundering of monetary instruments===\nCounts 12 through 16 were in violation of {{uscsub|18|1956|a|1|A|i}}.  Knowing that property involved in a [[financial transaction]] represents the proceeds of some unlawful activity, Ancheta conducted financial transactions that involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity and those proceeds were further used with the intent to promote more unlawful activity. Proceeds from selling worms and the rental of the botnet were being passed as legitimate online transactions such as payments for web hosting or dedicated box services. Anchta was also transferring the same payments to internet hosting companies for additional access to the servers used to commit further fraud.  From November 2004 to May 2005 varying amounts of funds were transferred from [[Wells Fargo Bank]] to FDCServers and Sago Networks.\n\n===Criminal forfeiture===\nCount 17 was in violation of {{uscsub|18|982}} and {{uscsub|21|853}}. Ancheta was required to forfeit all property involved in the offence.  This included $2998.81 generated from the sale of internet bots and proxies and deposited into a Wells Fargo account, approximately $58,357.86 in proceeds generated from the surreptitious install of adware on protected computers linked to a PayPal account owned by Ancheta, a 1993 BMW 325 IS, and all property used to commit or facilitate the commission of the above violations including desktop computers, laptops and hard drives.\n\n==Summary of laws applied==\n*{{uscsub|18|371}}: Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States\n*{{uscsub|21|853}}: Criminal Forfeiture\n*{{uscsub|18|982}}: Criminal Forfeiture\n*{{uscsub|18|1037|a|1}}:  Fraud and related activity in connection with [[email]]\n*{{uscsub|18|1037|b|2|A}}:  Fraud and related activity in connection with email\n*{{uscsub|18|1037|b|2|F}}:  Fraud and related activity in connection with email\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|3}}: Computer trespassing in a government computer\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|4}}: Committing fraud with a [[protected computer]]\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}: Damaging a protected computer (including viruses, worms)\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|i}}: Damaging a protected computer (including viruses, worms)\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|b}}: Conspiracy to violate (a)\n*{{uscsub|18|1956|a|1|A|i}}: Laundering of monetary instruments\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Computer crime]]\n*[[Computer worm]]\n*[[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Howard Morland}}\n*[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cyberlaw/usanchetaind.pdf Text of the decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090531150650/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/anchetaArrest.htm US Department of Justice - Ancheta Case]\n*[http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Build_your_own_botnet_with_open_source_software Wired.com How-to: Build your own botnet with open source software]\n\n[[Category:United States federal criminal case law]]\n[[Category:Botnets]]\n[[Category:2006 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:United States District Court for the Central District of California cases]]\n[[Category:Hacking (computer security)]]\n[[Category:Denial-of-service attacks]]\n[[Category:2006 in computer science]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=March 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox court case\n| name               = United States of America v.

Ancheta acted as a consultant and advised the buyer on the exact number of bots they would need to successfully accomplish the designated attack. He would offer separate channels for an additional cost to assist in the control and direction of the bots, providing temporary control over the channel to the buyer.  Around the time of this crime, it was estimated that an average botnet was 20,000 computers in size.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=Lee|title=Hackers Strengthen Malicious Botnets By Shrinking Them|journal=Computer|issue=April 2006|pages=19|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=April 2006|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2006/04/r4017.pdf|doi=10.1109/MC.2006.136|volume=39}}</ref>  He also profited from sale of the developed worm which he would configure for best propagation.  Buyers also had the option of using their own malware to launch the attack and not use the worm he was offering.  Ancheta accepted all payments through [[PayPal]], where he would misleadingly describe the nature of the transaction as hosting, [[web hosting]], or dedicated box services.\n\n==Case legal details==\n\nIn total there were 17 different counts in this case.\n\n===Conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud a US agency===\nCount 1 was in violation of {{uscsub|18|371}}.  This refers to the conspiracy between Ancheta and others to commit an offense or to defraud a US agency. This violated {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}, {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|i}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}} of [[US Code]].\n\n===Fraud and related activity in connection with computers===\nCounts 2 through 11 were in violation of {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}, {{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|v}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}}\n\nCounts 2, 3 and 4 involved intentionally causing damage while accessing an unauthorized computer belonging to King Pao Electronic Co and Sanyo Electric Software which if completed would have caused damage exceeding $5000 and launching a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack to a company (whose name remains confidential) which if completed would have caused damage exceeding $5000.  In furtherance of the conspiracy Ancheta committed various overt acts, including payments to accomplices, directing numerous computers to [[adware]] servers controlled by Ancheta himself.  These servers were where unsuspecting users would be redirected to download the [[malware]]. Counts 5 and 6 included knowingly causing the transmission of malicious code to protected computers belonging to the [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]] and the US [[Defense Information Systems Agency]];  both used for justice, national defence, and national security.  NAWS China Lake is a major Navy research, testing and evaluation facility and DISA provides IT and communication support the President and other top executive staff of the US Government.\n\nCount 7 through 11 were in violation of {{uscsub|18|1030|a|4}} and {{uscsub|18|1030|b}}. Ancheta knowingly accessed without authorization, computers involved in interstate and foreign commerce by installing adware without notice,  or consent with the sole intent to defraud.  Between 8,744 and 53,321 computers (different for each count) were accessed without authorization and monetary amounts between  $1306.52 and 7966.10 (different for each count) accepted as payment for services.\n\n===Laundering of monetary instruments===\nCounts 12 through 16 were in violation of {{uscsub|18|1956|a|1|A|i}}.  Knowing that property involved in a [[financial transaction]] represents the proceeds of some unlawful activity, Ancheta conducted financial transactions that involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity and those proceeds were further used with the intent to promote more unlawful activity. Proceeds from selling worms and the rental of the botnet were being passed as legitimate online transactions such as payments for web hosting or dedicated box services. Anchta was also transferring the same payments to internet hosting companies for additional access to the servers used to commit further fraud.  From November 2004 to May 2005 varying amounts of funds were transferred from [[Wells Fargo Bank]] to FDCServers and Sago Networks.\n\n===Criminal forfeiture===\nCount 17 was in violation of {{uscsub|18|982}} and {{uscsub|21|853}}. Ancheta was required to forfeit all property involved in the offence.  This included $2998.81 generated from the sale of internet bots and proxies and deposited into a Wells Fargo account, approximately $58,357.86 in proceeds generated from the surreptitious install of adware on protected computers linked to a PayPal account owned by Ancheta, a 1993 BMW 325 IS, and all property used to commit or facilitate the commission of the above violations including desktop computers, laptops and hard drives.\n\n==Summary of laws applied==\n*{{uscsub|18|371}}: Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States\n*{{uscsub|21|853}}: Criminal Forfeiture\n*{{uscsub|18|982}}: Criminal Forfeiture\n*{{uscsub|18|1037|a|1}}:  Fraud and related activity in connection with [[email]]\n*{{uscsub|18|1037|b|2|A}}:  Fraud and related activity in connection with email\n*{{uscsub|18|1037|b|2|F}}:  Fraud and related activity in connection with email\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|3}}: Computer trespassing in a government computer\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|4}}: Committing fraud with a [[protected computer]]\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|A|i}}: Damaging a protected computer (including viruses, worms)\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|a|5|B|i}}: Damaging a protected computer (including viruses, worms)\n*{{uscsub|18|1030|b}}: Conspiracy to violate (a)\n*{{uscsub|18|1956|a|1|A|i}}: Laundering of monetary instruments\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Computer crime]]\n*[[Computer worm]]\n*[[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Howard Morland}}\n*[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cyberlaw/usanchetaind.pdf Text of the decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090531150650/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/anchetaArrest.htm US Department of Justice - Ancheta Case]\n*[http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Build_your_own_botnet_with_open_source_software Wired.com How-to: Build your own botnet with open source software]\n\n[[Category:United States federal criminal case law]]\n[[Category:Botnets]]\n[[Category:2006 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:United States District Court for the Central District of California cases]]\n[[Category:Hacking (computer security)]]\n[[Category:Denial-of-service attacks]]\n[[Category:2006 in computer science]]\n", "name_user": "124.122.40.207", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Ancheta"}

{"title_page": "Zombie (computing)", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn computing, a '''zombie''' is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse program and can be used to  perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.  Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks (DoS attacks).  Most owners of \"zombie\" computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to fictional zombies. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a \"zombie horde attack\", as depicted in fictional zombie films.\n\n==Advertising==\n\nZombie computers have been used extensively to send e-mail spam; as of 2005, an estimated 50&ndash;80% of all spam worldwide was sent by zombie computers. This allows spammers to avoid detection and presumably reduces their bandwidth costs, since the owners of zombies pay for their own bandwidth. This spam also greatly furthers the spread of Trojan horses, as Trojans are not self-replicating. They rely on the movement of e-mails or spam to grow, whereas worms can spread by other means For similar reasons zombies are also used to commit  against sites displaying  advertising. Others can host  or  recruiting websites.\n\n== Distributed denial-of-service attacks ==\nZombies can be used to conduct [[distributed denial-of-service]] (DDoS) attacks, a term which refers to the orchestrated flooding of target websites by large numbers of computers at once. The large number of Internet users making simultaneous requests of a website's server is intended to result in crashing and the prevention of legitimate users from accessing the site.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Truth about Avoiding Scams|page=[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutavoidi0000weis/page/201 201]|first=Steve|last=Weisman|publisher=FT Press|year=2008|isbn=0-13-233385-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/truthaboutavoidi0000weis/page/201}}</ref> A variant of this type of flooding is known as distributed degradation-of-service. Committed by \"pulsing\" zombies, distributed degradation-of-service is the moderated and periodical flooding of websites intended to slow down rather than crash a victim site. The effectiveness of this tactic springs from the fact that intense flooding can be quickly detected and remedied, but pulsing zombie attacks and the resulting slow-down in website access can go unnoticed for months and even years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law|year=2006|page=325|first=Aaron|last=Schwabach|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-731-7}}</ref> Notable incidents of distributed denial- and degradation-of-service attacks in the past include the attack upon the [[Spam Prevention Early Warning System|SPEWS]] service in 2003, and the one against [[Blue Frog]] service in 2006. In 2000, several prominent Web sites ([[Yahoo]], [[eBay]], etc.) were clogged to a standstill by a distributed denial of service attack mounted by \u2018[[MafiaBoy]]\u2019, a Canadian teenager. \n\nAn attack on grc.com is discussed at length,{{Vague|date=November 2019}} and the perpetrator, a 13-year-old probably from [[Sardis, Mississippi]], was identified on the Gibson Research Web site. [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] disassembled a 'bot' which was a zombie used in the attack, and traced it to its distributor.{{Vague|date=November 2019}} In his account about his research, he describes the operation of a 'bot'-controlling [[IRC]] channel.<ref>Steve Gibson, [http://www.crime-research.org/library/grcdos.pdf The Attacks on GRC.COM], ''[[Gibson Research Corporation]]'', first: May 4, 2001, last: August 12, 2009</ref>{{Vague|date=November 2019}}\n\n== Smartphones ==\nBeginning in July 2009, similar botnet capabilities have also emerged for the growing [[smartphone]] market. Examples include the July 2009 in the \"wild\" release of the Sexy Space [[text message]] worm, the world's first botnet capable [[SMS]] worm, which targeted the [[Symbian]] operating system in [[Nokia]] smartphones. Later that month, researcher [[Charlie Miller (security researcher)|Charlie Miller]] revealed a [[proof of concept]] text message worm for the [[iPhone]] at [[Black Hat Briefings]]. Also in July, [[United Arab Emirates]] consumers were targeted by the [[Etisalat]] BlackBerry [[spyware]] program. In the 2010s, the security community is divided as to the real world potential of mobile botnets. But in an August 2009 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', cyber security consultant [[Michael Gregg]] summarized the issue this way: \"We are about at the point with [smart]phones that we were with desktops in the '80s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/phone-hacking-threat-is-low-but-it-exists/|title=Phone Hacking Threat Is Low, but it Exists|first=Roy|last=Furchgott|website=Gadgetwise Blog|publisher=[[New York Times]]|access-date=July 16, 2017|date=August 14, 2009|archivedate=July 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716042023/https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/phone-hacking-threat-is-low-but-it-exists/}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BASHLITE]]\n* [[Botnet]]\n* [[Denial-of-service attack]]\n* [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]]\n* [[Malware]]\n* [[RDP shop]]\n* [[Trojan horse (computing)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{external links|date=May 2017}}\n<!-- DEAD LINK: *[http://www.hackillusion.com/2011/02/what-is-zombie-and-how-to-prevent-from.html What is zombie and how to prevent from zombie] -->\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061230152432/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2144375/botnet-operation-ruled-million Botnet operation controlled 1.5 million PCs]\n*[http://antivirus.about.com/od/whatisavirus/a/zombiepc.htm Is Your PC a Zombie? on About.com]\n*[http://lowkeysoft.com/proxy/ Intrusive analysis of a web-based proxy zombie network]\n*[http://tweezersedge.com/archives/2005/02/000534.html A detailed account of what a zombie machine looks like and what it takes to \"fix\" it]\n*[http://radsoft.net/news/roundups/grc/wkd/ Correspondence between Steve Gibson and Wicked]\n*[http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2006/01/16/zombie-comment-spam-referer-spam.html Zombie networks, comment spam, and referer [sic&#93; spam]\n*[http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/phone-hacking-threat-is-low-but-it-exists/ The New York Times: Phone Hacking Threat is Low, But It Exists]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqB-0sI8e-4 Hackers Target Cell Phones, WPLG-TV/ABC-10 Miami]\n*[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/07/blackberry-spyware/ Researcher: BlackBerry Spyware Wasn\u2019t Ready for Prime Time]\n*[https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/28/hackers-iphone-apple-technology-security-hackers.html Forbes: How to Hijack Every iPhone in the World]\n*[https://www.pcworld.com/article/173089/hackers_plan_to_clobber_the_cloud_spy_on_blackberries.html Hackers Plan to Clobber the Cloud, Spy on Blackberries]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091024033302/http://www.blackberrycool.com/2009/07/16/smobile-systems-release-solution-for-etisalat-blackberry-spyware/ SMobile Systems release solution for Etisalat BlackBerry spyware]\n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/loic-irc-0/ LOIC IRC-0 - An Open-Source IRC Botnet for Network Stress Testing]\n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/loic-slow-irc/ An Open-Source IRC and Webpage Botnet for Network Stress Testing]\n{{Malware}}\n[[Category:Computer network security]]\n[[Category:Denial-of-service attacks]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Botnets]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{About|the term \"zombie\" in computer security|\"zombie\" in UNIX programming|Zombie process}}\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''zombie''' is a computer connected to the Internet that has been [[computer security|compromised]] by a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], [[computer virus]] or [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] program and can be used to  perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.

Sharpe|year=2007|isbn=0-7656-1748-X}}</ref> For similar reasons zombies are also used to commit [[click fraud]] against sites displaying [[pay-per-click]] advertising. Others can host [[phishing]] or [[money mule]] recruiting websites.\n\n== Distributed denial-of-service attacks ==\nZombies can be used to conduct [[distributed denial-of-service]] (DDoS) attacks, a term which refers to the orchestrated flooding of target websites by large numbers of computers at once. The large number of Internet users making simultaneous requests of a website's server is intended to result in crashing and the prevention of legitimate users from accessing the site.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Truth about Avoiding Scams|page=[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutavoidi0000weis/page/201 201]|first=Steve|last=Weisman|publisher=FT Press|year=2008|isbn=0-13-233385-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/truthaboutavoidi0000weis/page/201}}</ref> A variant of this type of flooding is known as distributed degradation-of-service. Committed by \"pulsing\" zombies, distributed degradation-of-service is the moderated and periodical flooding of websites intended to slow down rather than crash a victim site. The effectiveness of this tactic springs from the fact that intense flooding can be quickly detected and remedied, but pulsing zombie attacks and the resulting slow-down in website access can go unnoticed for months and even years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law|year=2006|page=325|first=Aaron|last=Schwabach|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-731-7}}</ref> Notable incidents of distributed denial- and degradation-of-service attacks in the past include the attack upon the [[Spam Prevention Early Warning System|SPEWS]] service in 2003, and the one against [[Blue Frog]] service in 2006. In 2000, several prominent Web sites ([[Yahoo]], [[eBay]], etc.) were clogged to a standstill by a distributed denial of service attack mounted by \u2018[[MafiaBoy]]\u2019, a Canadian teenager. \n\nAn attack on grc.com is discussed at length,{{Vague|date=November 2019}} and the perpetrator, a 13-year-old probably from [[Sardis, Mississippi]], was identified on the Gibson Research Web site. [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] disassembled a 'bot' which was a zombie used in the attack, and traced it to its distributor.{{Vague|date=November 2019}} In his account about his research, he describes the operation of a 'bot'-controlling [[IRC]] channel.<ref>Steve Gibson, [http://www.crime-research.org/library/grcdos.pdf The Attacks on GRC.COM], ''[[Gibson Research Corporation]]'', first: May 4, 2001, last: August 12, 2009</ref>{{Vague|date=November 2019}}\n\n== Smartphones ==\nBeginning in July 2009, similar botnet capabilities have also emerged for the growing [[smartphone]] market. Examples include the July 2009 in the \"wild\" release of the Sexy Space [[text message]] worm, the world's first botnet capable [[SMS]] worm, which targeted the [[Symbian]] operating system in [[Nokia]] smartphones. Later that month, researcher [[Charlie Miller (security researcher)|Charlie Miller]] revealed a [[proof of concept]] text message worm for the [[iPhone]] at [[Black Hat Briefings]]. Also in July, [[United Arab Emirates]] consumers were targeted by the [[Etisalat]] BlackBerry [[spyware]] program. In the 2010s, the security community is divided as to the real world potential of mobile botnets. But in an August 2009 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', cyber security consultant [[Michael Gregg]] summarized the issue this way: \"We are about at the point with [smart]phones that we were with desktops in the '80s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/phone-hacking-threat-is-low-but-it-exists/|title=Phone Hacking Threat Is Low, but it Exists|first=Roy|last=Furchgott|website=Gadgetwise Blog|publisher=[[New York Times]]|access-date=July 16, 2017|date=August 14, 2009|archivedate=July 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716042023/https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/phone-hacking-threat-is-low-but-it-exists/}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BASHLITE]]\n* [[Botnet]]\n* [[Denial-of-service attack]]\n* [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]]\n* [[Malware]]\n* [[RDP shop]]\n* [[Trojan horse (computing)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{external links|date=May 2017}}\n<!-- DEAD LINK: *[http://www.hackillusion.com/2011/02/what-is-zombie-and-how-to-prevent-from.html What is zombie and how to prevent from zombie] -->\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061230152432/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2144375/botnet-operation-ruled-million Botnet operation controlled 1.5 million PCs]\n*[http://antivirus.about.com/od/whatisavirus/a/zombiepc.htm Is Your PC a Zombie? on About.com]\n*[http://lowkeysoft.com/proxy/ Intrusive analysis of a web-based proxy zombie network]\n*[http://tweezersedge.com/archives/2005/02/000534.html A detailed account of what a zombie machine looks like and what it takes to \"fix\" it]\n*[http://radsoft.net/news/roundups/grc/wkd/ Correspondence between Steve Gibson and Wicked]\n*[http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2006/01/16/zombie-comment-spam-referer-spam.html Zombie networks, comment spam, and referer [sic&#93; spam]\n*[http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/phone-hacking-threat-is-low-but-it-exists/ The New York Times: Phone Hacking Threat is Low, But It Exists]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqB-0sI8e-4 Hackers Target Cell Phones, WPLG-TV/ABC-10 Miami]\n*[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/07/blackberry-spyware/ Researcher: BlackBerry Spyware Wasn\u2019t Ready for Prime Time]\n*[https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/28/hackers-iphone-apple-technology-security-hackers.html Forbes: How to Hijack Every iPhone in the World]\n*[https://www.pcworld.com/article/173089/hackers_plan_to_clobber_the_cloud_spy_on_blackberries.html Hackers Plan to Clobber the Cloud, Spy on Blackberries]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091024033302/http://www.blackberrycool.com/2009/07/16/smobile-systems-release-solution-for-etisalat-blackberry-spyware/ SMobile Systems release solution for Etisalat BlackBerry spyware]\n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/loic-irc-0/ LOIC IRC-0 - An Open-Source IRC Botnet for Network Stress Testing]\n* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/loic-slow-irc/ An Open-Source IRC and Webpage Botnet for Network Stress Testing]\n{{Malware}}\n[[Category:Computer network security]]\n[[Category:Denial-of-service attacks]]\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Botnets]]\n", "name_user": "124.122.40.207", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computing)"}
