This lottery was set up with funds from Blagrave's will and it continued up until the 19th century upon Balgrave's contribution. Three maidservants of good character and five year's service to one master were selected by the three parishes of Reading.

{"title_page": "Skywalker saga", "text_new": "The Star Wars film series, which developed into a trilogy of trilogies and which has been rebranded as the \"Skywalker saga\" was released beginning with the Lucas/Kershner/Marquand-directed original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI, 1977\u20131983), followed by the Lucas-directed prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III, 1999\u20132005) and Abrams/Johnson-directed sequel trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII and IX, 2015\u20132019).The three trilogies each focus on the Force-sensitive Skywalker family. The prequels focus on Anakin Skywalker and his training as a Jedi and eventual fall to the dark side as Darth Vader. The original trilogy follows his children, Luke and Leia, as they join the Rebel Alliance and battle Vader and the Galactic Empire. The sequel trilogy features Kylo Ren (Ben Solo), a major antagonist and eventual Supreme Leader of the First Order, and son of Leia, nephew of Luke, and grandson of Anakin.\n\nEach episodic film begins with an opening crawl, accompanied by the main Star Wars theme by John Williams, who composes the scores for each film. The first six films have had retroactive changes made after their initial theatrical releases, most notably the original trilogy.\n\nOriginal trilogy\tEdit\n\nMain article: Star Wars Trilogy\n\nFilm\tU.S. release date\tDirector\tScreenwriter(s)\tStory by\tProducer(s)\n\nEpisode IV \u2013 A New Hope\tMay 25, 1977\tGeorge Lucas\tGary Kurtz\n\nEpisode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back\tMay 21, 1980\tIrvin Kershner\tLeigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan\tGeorge Lucas\n\nEpisode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi\tMay 25, 1983\tRichard Marquand\tLawrence Kasdan and George Lucas\tHoward Kazanjian\n\nImmediately after directing American Graffiti (1973), Lucas wrote a two-page synopsis for the space opera he had been planning, which 20th Century Fox invested in.[5] Lucas expanded his treatment into an overview called The Star Wars,[6] and by 1974, he had written the screenplay's first draft.[7] Lucas negotiated to retain the sequel rights,[8] and cast American Graffiti actor Harrison Ford as Han Solo.[9]\n\nStar Wars was released on May 25, 1977, followed by The Empire Strikes Back on May 21, 1980, and Return of the Jedi on May 25, 1983. The plot of the original trilogy centers on the Galactic Civil War of the Rebel Alliance trying to free the galaxy from the clutches of the evil Sith Lord[c] Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, as well as on Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi.\n\nEpisode IV \u2013 A New Hope (1977)\tEdit\n\nThe central trio of the original trilogy was played by Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia).\n\nThe original eponymous Star Wars film[d] opens with a Rebel spaceship being intercepted by the Empire above the desert planet of Tatooine. Aboard, the deadly Imperial agent Darth Vader and his stormtroopers capture Princess Leia Organa, a secret member of the rebellion. Before her capture, Leia makes sure the droid R2-D2 will escape with stolen Imperial blueprints and a holographic message for the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has been living in exile on Tatooine. Along with C-3PO, R2-D2 falls under the ownership of Luke Skywalker, a farmboy who has been raised by his aunt and uncle. Luke helps the droids locate Obi-Wan, now a solitary old hermit known as Ben Kenobi. He reveals himself as a friend of Luke's absent father, Anakin Skywalker, who was Obi-Wan's Jedi apprentice until being murdered by Vader. He tells Luke he must also become a Jedi. After discovering his family's homestead has been destroyed by the Empire, they hire the smuggler Han Solo, his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca and their space freighter, the Millennium Falcon. They discover that Leia's homeworld of Alderaan has been destroyed, and are soon captured by the planet-destroying Death Star. While Obi-Wan disables its tractor beam, Luke and Han rescue the captive Princess Leia. Finally, they deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance with the hope of exploiting a weakness.[10]\n\nThe first rough draft, titled The Star Wars, introduced \"the Force\" and the young hero Luke Skywalker. Anakin [sic] appeared as Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. The third draft replaced (a deceased) Anakin with Ben Kenobi.[7] Some months later, Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to two sequels. By 1976, a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled The Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars. During production, Lucas changed Luke's name to Skywalker and shortened the title to The Star Wars, and finally just Star Wars.[7] At that point, Lucas was not expecting the film to warrant full-scale sequels. The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes to become a self-contained story ending with the destruction of the Empire in the Death Star. The intention was that if the film was successful, Lucas could adapt a sequel novel of Alan Dean Foster into low-budget film sequels.[11] By that point, Lucas had developed a tentative backstory to aid in developing the saga.[12]Star Wars exceeded all expectations. The success of the film and its merchandise sales led Lucas to make Star Wars the basis of an elaborate film serial,[13] and use the profits to finance his filmmaking center, Skywalker Ranch.[14] After the release of the first sequel, the original film was subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope for a rerelease in 1981.[15][16][17]\n\nEpisode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\tEdit\n\nPeter Mayhew and actor Kenny Baker portrayed Chewbacca and R2-D2, respectively, until The Force Awakens. Chewbacca is absent from Episode I, II, and Rogue One, while R2-D2 appears in every Star Wars film except Solo.\n\nSet three years after the destruction of the Death Star,[18] The Empire Strikes Back begins with the Empire forcing the Rebel Alliance to evacuate its secret base on Hoth. Instructed by Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke travels to the swamp world of Dagobah to find the exiled Jedi Master Yoda. Luke's Jedi training is interrupted by Vader, who lures him into a trap by capturing Han and Leia at Cloud City, governed by Han's old friend Lando. During a fierce duel, Vader reveals a shocking truth about Luke's father.[19]\n\nOwing to financial concerns, Alan Dean Foster's sequel novel, Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978), restricted the story to Luke, Leia, and Darth Vader.[20][21] But after the success of the original film, Lucas knew a sequel would be granted a reasonable budget, and hired Leigh Brackett to write it from scratch. She finished a draft by early 1978, but died of cancer before Lucas was able to discuss changes he wanted made to it.[22] His disappointment with the first draft may have made him consider new directions.[23] Lucas penned the next draft, the first screenplay to feature episodic numbering for a Star Wars story.[24] Lucas found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggle writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more[25] in April 1978. The plot twist of Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series.[26] After writing these drafts, Lucas fleshed out the backstory between Anakin, Obi-Wan, and the Emperor.[27]\n\nWith this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies,[28] designating the first sequel Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back in the next draft.[25] Lawrence Kasdan, who had just completed writing Raiders of the Lost Ark, was hired to write the next drafts, and given additional input from director Irvin Kershner. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult story, and developed the sequel from the light adventure roots of the first film.[29]\n\nEpisode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi (1983)\tEdit\n\nSet about a year after Vader's revelation,[18] Return of the Jedi sees Luke joining Leia and Lando in a rescue attempt to save Han from the gangster Jabba the Hutt. Afterward, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training, only to find Yoda on his deathbed.[30] In his last words, Yoda confirms the truth that Vader is Anakin, Luke's father, and that Luke must confront him again in order to complete his training. As the rebels lead an attack on the second Death Star, Luke engages Vader in another lightsaber duel as Emperor Palpatine watches; both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice.[31]\n\nKurtz wanted a bittersweet and nuanced ending they had outlined that saw Han dead, the Rebel forces in pieces, Leia struggling as a queen, and Luke walking off alone (like in a Spaghetti Western)\u2014while Lucas wanted a happier ending, partly to encourage toy sales. This led to tension between the two, resulting in Kurtz leaving the production.[32]\n\nPrequel trilogy\tEdit\n\nMain article: Star Wars prequel trilogy\n\nFilm\tU.S. release date\tDirector(s)\tScreenwriter(s)\tStory by\tProducer(s)\n\nEpisode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace\tMay 19, 1999\tGeorge Lucas\tRick McCallum\n\nEpisode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones\tMay 16, 2002\tGeorge Lucas\tGeorge Lucas and Jonathan Hales\tGeorge Lucas\n\nEpisode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith\tMay 19, 2005\tGeorge Lucas\n\nLoose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original trilogy.[33] Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery, inspired him to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga.[34]\n\nThe prequel trilogy consists of Episode I: The Phantom Menace, released on May 19, 1999; Episode II: Attack of the Clones, released on May 16, 2002; and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, released on May 19, 2005.[35] The plot focuses on the fall of the Galactic Republic and near extinction of the Jedi as well as the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader.\n\nThe heroes of the prequels were played by Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan), Natalie Portman (Padm\u00e9), and Jake Lloyd (Anakin, in the first film only), respectively.\n\nEpisode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999)\tEdit\n\nSet 32 years before the original film,[18] The Phantom Menace begins with two Jedi who, acting as negotiators of the Republic, discover that the corrupt Trade Federation has formed a blockade around the planet Naboo. Sith Lord Darth Sidious has secretly caused the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, 25-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi, encounter a native of Naboo who helps them find the Queen of Naboo. With Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, they escape the blockade, but not without their starship being damaged. Landing on Tatooine for repairs, they meet a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon helps liberate the boy by betting with his master in a podrace, believing him to be the \"Chosen One\" prophesied by the Jedi to bring balance to the Force. Sidious dispatches his Sith apprentice, Darth Maul, to attack the queen's Jedi protectors. Arriving on Coruscant so the queen can plead Naboo's crisis before the Republic Senate, Anakin is brought before the Jedi Council, where Yoda senses that he possesses too much fear to be trained. The Jedi are ordered to accompany the queen back to Naboo, where she pleads to the natives for their help in the battle against the droid army.[36]\n\nThe prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy, but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin.[37] This would shape the film series into a self-contained saga. In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel, initially titled Episode I: The Beginning. Following the film's release, Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two.[38]\n\nEpisode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002)\tEdit\n\nHayden Christensen plays Anakin in Episodes II and III. Puppeteer Frank Oz and actor Ian McDiarmid play Yoda and Palpatine, respectively, in all three trilogies. McDiarmid was added into the 2004 release of The Empire Strikes Back, while Christensen appears as Anakin's Force ghost in Return of the Jedi.\n\nTen years after the Battle of Naboo,[18] Attack of the Clones opens with an assassination attempt upon former Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, who is serving as the Senator of Naboo. 35 year-old Obi-Wan and his apprentice, a 19 year-old Anakin, are assigned to protect her; Obi-Wan tracks the killer, while Anakin and Padm\u00e9 retreat to Naboo. They soon fall in love with each other, albeit secretly due to the Jedi Order's rule against attachment. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine secretly schemes to draw the entire galaxy into the \"Clone War\" between the Republic army led by the Jedi, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by Count Dooku (the former master of Obi-Wan's deceased master Qui-Gon, and Palpatine's new Sith apprentice).[39]\n\nThe first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, to polish it.[40] Lucas used the basic backstory developed for earlier Star Wars films in the concept of an army of clone shock troopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were resisted by the Jedi.[41]\n\nEpisode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005)\tEdit\n\nRevenge of the Sith begins three years into the Clone Wars,[18] with Anakin and Obi-Wan leading a rescue mission to save Chancellor Palpatine from Count Dooku and the droid commander General Grievous. Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of his secret wife Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth. Palpatine, who had been secretly engineering the Clone Wars to destroy the Jedi Order, convinces Anakin, who grows resentful towards the Jedi due to their seeming mistrust of him, that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padm\u00e9's life. Desperate, Anakin betrays the Jedi and submits to Palpatine and is renamed his new apprentice Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the clone army to fire on their Jedi generals, and declares the former Republic an Empire. Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi, culminating in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar.[42]\n\nWork on Episode III began before Episode II was released, with one scene shot during the earlier film's production. The climactic duel has its basis in the Return of the Jedi novelization, in which Obi-Wan recounts his battle with Anakin that ended with the latter falling \"into a molten pit\".[43] A rough draft screenplay includes a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through the Force.[44]\n\nSequel trilogy\tEdit\n\nMain article: Star Wars sequel trilogy\n\nFilm\tU.S. release date\tDirector(s)\tScreenwriter(s)\tStory by\tProducer(s)\n\nEpisode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens\tDecember 18, 2015\tJ.

Abrams and Michelle Rejwan\n\nPrior to releasing the original film, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\",[28][45] but after beginning work on the prequels, insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that no third trilogy would be developed.[46][47][48] Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney in late 2012, a new trilogy was announced, which began with Episode VII in 2015.[49]\n\nThe main cast of the trilogy includes Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron), respectively.\n\nThe sequel trilogy focuses on the journey of the orphaned scavenger Rey following in the footsteps of the Jedi with the guidance of Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-Stormtrooper Finn, she helps the Resistance led by Leia fight the First Order commanded by Supreme Leader Snoke and his pupil Kylo Ren (Han Solo and Leia's son). Episode VII: The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi on December 15, 2017, and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker was released on December 20, 2019.\n\nEpisode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens (2015)\tEdit\n\nThe Force Awakens is set thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the deaths of Vader and the Emperor,[18] by which time Luke Skywalker has gone missing. The remnants of the Empire have become the First Order lead by Supreme Leader Snoke who seek to destroy Luke and the New Republic. They are opposed by the Resistance, led by princess-turned-general Leia Organa. On the planet of Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron obtains a map to Luke's location, but is captured by stormtroopers under the command of First Order enforcer Kylo Ren (revealed to be the son of Leia and Han Solo and former Jedi-trained by his uncle Luke), who fell to the dark side after being seduced by Snoke. Poe's droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and encounters a scavenger girl, Rey. Kylo tortures Poe and learns of BB-8. A defecting stormtrooper, FN-2187, frees Poe, who dubs him \"Finn\", and both escape in a TIE fighter. Poe is seemingly killed in a crash-landing upon Jakku. Finn finds Rey and BB-8, as the First Order pursues them; they escape together in the impounded Millennium Falcon. The Falcon is recaptured by Han Solo and Chewbacca, working as smugglers again. They agree to help deliver the map inside BB-8 to the Resistance.\n\nIn early 2013, Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm officially announced J. J. Abrams as Star Wars Episode VII's director and producer, along with Bryan Burk and Bad Robot Productions.[50] The screenplay for Episode VII was originally set to be written by Michael Arndt, but in October 2013 it was announced that writing duties would be taken over by Lawrence Kasdan and J. J. Abrams.[51][52]\n\nWarwick Davis and Anthony Daniels have appeared in the most Star Wars films, with Daniels playing C-3PO in all except Solo.\n\nEpisode VIII \u2013 The Last Jedi (2017)\tEdit\n\nAfter a battle scene which overlaps with the end of the previous film, The Last Jedi follows Rey's attempt to convince Luke Skywalker to teach her the ways of the Force. She also seeks answers about her past and the conflict between Luke and his nephew Kylo Ren. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey starts using the Force to communicate with Ren. Meanwhile, Leia leads Poe, Finn, Rose Tico, BB-8, and the rest of the Resistance as they are pursued by the First Order, led by Snoke with Kylo as his second in command. After hearing Ren's perspective, Rey disagrees with Luke and leaves him in an attempt to redeem Kylo and achieve peace. In doing this, Rey unwittingly helps Kylo kill Snoke. However, Ren's intentions are to replace Snoke as Supreme Leader, believing that destroying the Jedi and the Resistance is the only way to achieve peace. Rey must choose between Kylo's offer to rule the galaxy with him, or helping the outnumbered Resistance survive on Crait.\n\nIn late 2012, it was reported that Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg would write and produce Episodes VIII and IX.[53] Kasdan and Kinberg were later confirmed as consultants on those films. In addition, John Williams, who wrote the music for the previous six episodes, was hired to compose the music for Episodes VII, VIII and IX.[54] On March 12, 2015, Lucasfilm announced that Looper director Rian Johnson would direct Episode VIII with Ram Bergman as producer for Ram Bergman Productions.[55] When asked about Episode VIII in mid-2014, Johnson said \"I'm just happy. I don't have the terror I kind of expected I would... I'm sure I will at some point.\"[56] Principal photography began in February 2016[57] and wrapped in July 2016.[58][59][60] Carrie Fisher had finished filming her scenes, but died on December 27, 2016,[61] approximately a year before the film's release.\n\nEpisode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\tEdit\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker is the final film of the Skywalker saga,[62] featuring a climactic clash between the Resistance and the First Order, and the Jedi and the Sith.[63][64] The film is set a year following The Last Jedi and depicts the return of the presumed-dead Palpatine,[65] who has been secretly controlling the First Order from the Sith planet Exegol. Palpatine tasks Kylo Ren with finding Rey, who is revealed to be the former's granddaughter. Palpatine unveils an armada of Star Destroyers, which he calls the Final Order, to reclaim the galaxy. Rey and the Resistance learn of Palpatine's return and embark on a quest to find him. They eventually locate Exegol; Rey confronts Palpatine while the Resistance attack Palpatine's fleet.\n\nProduction on Episode IX was scheduled to begin in 2017.[66] After Carrie Fisher's death, it was announced that her role would be created from unreleased footage from the previous two films.[67] By September 2017, original director Colin Trevorrow had left the project following creative differences.[68] J. J. Abrams returned to direct, and co-wrote the film alongside Chris Terrio. Principal photography began on August 1, 2018.[69] Most of the cast of The Last Jedi return, including Star Wars veterans Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Anthony Daniels. They are joined by Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian,[70] and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine,[65] who returned to the franchise onscreen for the first time since Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, respectively\n", "text_old": "#REDIRECT [[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga]]\n", "name_user": "Legobro99", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skywalker_saga&redirect=no"}

As a junior, McNair led the Mount Olive Pirates to the state championship.

In 1992, McNair threw for 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves fashioned a record of 7\u20134, including a last-second victory in their rematch with [[Grambling State University|Grambling]]. In that contest, McNair returned from an injury and helped Alcorn State, trailing late in the final period, move deep into Tigers' territory. Then, despite a leg injury, he tucked the ball under his arm and dove into the end zone for the winning touchdown. The victory over Grambling helped the Braves qualify for the I-AA playoffs where they faced off against then-Northeast Louisiana, falling 78\u201327 to the Indians on November 21, 1992. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8\u20133 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. He was also named First-Team All-SWAC for the third year in a row.\n\nIn his senior season, McNair gained 6,281 combined yards rushing (904) and passing (5,377), along with 56 touchdowns. In the process, he surpassed more than a dozen records and was named an All-American. In addition, McNair won the [[Walter Payton Award]] as the top I-AA player<!--This was the last Payton Award for which all I-AA players were eligible. The next year, it became an offense-only award with the creation of the Buck Buchanan Award.--> and finished third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting behind [[Rashaan Salaam]] and [[Ki-Jana Carter]].

McNair did not see his first action until the last two series of the fourth quarter in a November game versus the [[1995 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]]. Late in the season, he also appeared briefly against the [[1995 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] and [[1995 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]. In 1996, McNair remained a backup to [[Chris Chandler]] until starting a game on December 8 in Week 15 against the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199612080oti.htm|title=Jacksonville Jaguars at Houston Oilers - December 8th, 1996 - Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\n====1997 season====\nMcNair's first season as the Oilers' starter in 1997 (the team's first year in [[Tennessee]]) resulted in an 8\u20138 record for the team, which played its home games at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Liberty Bowl]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. McNair's 2,665 passing yards were the most for the Oilers in a season since [[Warren Moon]] in 1993, and his 13 interceptions were the fewest for a single season in franchise history. He also led the team in rushing touchdowns with eight and ranked second behind running back [[Eddie George]] with 674 yards on the ground, the third-highest total for a quarterback in NFL history.\n\n====1998 season====\nIn 1998, McNair set career passing highs with 492 attempts, 289 completions, 3,228 yards and 15 touchdowns for the Oilers, now competing in Nashville. He also cut his interceptions to ten, helping his quarterback rating climb to 80.1.\n\n====1999 season: Super Bowl season====\nThe team officially changed its name from Oilers to Titans for the 1999 season as they debuted a new stadium, [[Adelphia Coliseum]]. Early in the season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following the Titans' 36\u201335 win over the [[1999 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], and needed surgery. In his stead entered [[Neil O'Donnell]], a veteran who had guided the [[1999 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] to the Super Bowl four years earlier. Over the next five games, O'Donnell led the Titans to a 4\u20131 record. McNair returned against the [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games, good for a record of 13\u20133 and second place in the [[AFC Central]].\n\nThe Titans opened the [[NFL playoffs, 1999\u20132000|playoffs]] at home against the [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] in a Wild Card game, winning on the \"[[Music City Miracle]]\" and eventually advancing to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in a rematch with the Rams. On the second to last play with the Titans facing 3rd down and 5 to go, McNair was hit by two Rams defenders, but he somehow got away and completed a 16-yard pass to [[Kevin Dyson]] to gain a 1st down at the Rams' 10-yard line. On the final play of the game, McNair's pass to Dyson was complete, but [[Final play of Super Bowl XXXIV|Dyson was unable to break the plane of the goal line]], giving the Rams the win. McNair signed a new six-year contract after the 1999 season worth US$47&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2006-04-22-notes_x.htm?csp=34 Notes: Favre backs McNair; Leinart hires Condon]. ''[[USA Today]]'', April 22, 2006. Retrieved July 4, 2009.</ref>\n\n====2000\u20132001 seasons====\nMcNair played in all sixteen games in 2000 but did not start the first of two annual games against the Steelers. This was because of a sternum injury incurred in a 17-14 win over the Kansas City Chiefs the previous game.  Following the Titans\u2019 bye week [[Neil O\u2019Donnell]] started against his former team but after O\u2019Donnell threw three picks he was sacked out of the game in the final four minutes. McNair came in and threw the winning touchdown to [[Erron Kinney]]; a missed Steelers field goal attempt ended the Titans win (23-20). \n\nFollowing a 13\u20133 season in 2000 which ended in a playoff loss to the [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], McNair put together his most productive year as a pro in 2001. In 2001, McNair registered career passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21) and quarterback rating (90.2). He was also the team's most effective rusher, tying George for the club lead with five scores. Named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, McNair sat out the game due to a shoulder injury.<ref>The Steve McNair Foundation, [http://www.officialstevemcnair.com/biography.php?pageid=3 Biography]. Retrieved July 4, 2009.</ref>\n\n====2002 season====\nIn 2002, Tennessee finished the regular season 11\u20135 and reached the playoffs. In the divisional playoff contest against the [[2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], McNair threw for a career postseason high 338 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions, while rushing for 29 yards and another score on the ground. The game had a controversial finish when, after missing a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation time and a second failed kick in overtime was negated because of a controversial running-into-the-kicker penalty on Pittsburgh's [[Dewayne Washington]], kicker [[Joe Nedney]] won the game from 26 yards out 2:15 into overtime. Steelers coach [[Bill Cowher]] said that he called a timeout before the winning kick took place.\nMcNair and the Titans reached the AFC Championship game but were unable to reach the Super Bowl, losing to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 41\u201324.\n\nBetween the 2002 and 2003 seasons, McNair was arrested for DUI and illegal gun possession (in May 2003).

In 1992, McNair threw for 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves fashioned a record of 7\u20134, including a last-second victory in their rematch with [[Grambling State University|Grambling]]. In that contest, McNair returned from an injury and helped Alcorn State, trailing late in the final period, move deep into Tigers' territory. Then, despite a leg injury, he tucked the ball under his arm and dove into the end zone for the winning touchdown. The victory over Grambling helped the Braves qualify for the I-AA playoffs where they faced off against then-Northeast Louisiana, falling 78\u201327 to the Indians on November 21, 1992. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8\u20133 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. He was also named First-Team All-SWAC for the third year in a row.\n\nIn his senior season, McNair gained 6,281 combined yards rushing (904) and passing (5,377), along with 56 touchdowns. In the process, he surpassed more than a dozen records and was named an All-American. In addition, McNair won the [[Walter Payton Award]] as the top I-AA player<!--This was the last Payton Award for which all I-AA players were eligible. The next year, it became an offense-only award with the creation of the Buck Buchanan Award.--> and finished third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting behind [[Rashaan Salaam]] and [[Ki-Jana Carter]].

Late in the season, he also appeared briefly against the [[1995 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] and [[1995 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]. In 1996, McNair remained a backup to [[Chris Chandler]] until starting a game on December 8 in Week 15 against the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199612080oti.htm|title=Jacksonville Jaguars at Houston Oilers - December 8th, 1996 - Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\n====1997 season====\nMcNair's first season as the Oilers' starter in 1997 (the team's first year in [[Tennessee]]) resulted in an 8\u20138 record for the team, which played its home games at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Liberty Bowl]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. McNair's 2,665 passing yards were the most for the Oilers in a season since [[Warren Moon]] in 1993, and his 13 interceptions were the fewest for a single season in franchise history. He also led the team in rushing touchdowns with eight and ranked second behind running back [[Eddie George]] with 674 yards on the ground, the third-highest total for a quarterback in NFL history.\n\n====1998 season====\nIn 1998, McNair set career passing highs with 492 attempts, 289 completions, 3,228 yards and 15 touchdowns for the Oilers, now competing in Nashville. He also cut his interceptions to ten, helping his quarterback rating climb to 80.1.\n\n====1999 season: Super Bowl season====\nThe team officially changed its name from Oilers to Titans for the 1999 season as they debuted a new stadium, [[Adelphia Coliseum]]. Early in the season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following the Titans' 36\u201335 win over the [[1999 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], and needed surgery. In his stead entered [[Neil O'Donnell]], a veteran who had guided the [[1999 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] to the Super Bowl four years earlier. Over the next five games, O'Donnell led the Titans to a 4\u20131 record. McNair returned against the [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games, good for a record of 13\u20133 and second place in the [[AFC Central]].\n\nThe Titans opened the [[NFL playoffs, 1999\u20132000|playoffs]] at home against the [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] in a Wild Card game, winning on the \"[[Music City Miracle]]\" and eventually advancing to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in a rematch with the Rams. On the second to last play with the Titans facing 3rd down and 5 to go, McNair was hit by two Rams defenders, but he somehow got away and completed a 16-yard pass to [[Kevin Dyson]] to gain a 1st down at the Rams' 10-yard line. On the final play of the game, McNair's pass to Dyson was complete, but [[Final play of Super Bowl XXXIV|Dyson was unable to break the plane of the goal line]], giving the Rams the win. McNair signed a new six-year contract after the 1999 season worth US$47&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2006-04-22-notes_x.htm?csp=34 Notes: Favre backs McNair; Leinart hires Condon].

This was because of a sternum injury incurred in a 17-14 win over the Kansas City Chiefs the previous game.  Following the Titans\u2019 bye week [[Neil O\u2019Donnell]] started against his former team but after O\u2019Donnell threw three picks he was sacked out of the game in the final four minutes. McNair came in and threw the winning touchdown to [[Erron Kinney]]; a missed Steelers field goal attempt ended the Titans win (23-20). \n\nFollowing a 13\u20133 season in 2000 which ended in a playoff loss to the [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], McNair put together his most productive year as a pro in 2001. In 2001, McNair registered career passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21) and quarterback rating (90.2). He was also the team's most effective rusher, tying George for the club lead with five scores. Named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, McNair sat out the game due to a shoulder injury.<ref>The Steve McNair Foundation, [http://www.officialstevemcnair.com/biography.php?pageid=3 Biography].

In the divisional playoff contest against the [[2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], McNair threw for a career postseason high 338 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions, while rushing for 29 yards and another score on the ground. The game had a controversial finish when, after missing a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation time and a second failed kick in overtime was negated because of a controversial running-into-the-kicker penalty on Pittsburgh's [[Dewayne Washington]], kicker [[Joe Nedney]] won the game from 26 yards out 2:15 into overtime. Steelers coach [[Bill Cowher]] said that he called a timeout before the winning kick took place.\nMcNair and the Titans reached the AFC Championship game but were unable to reach the Super Bowl, losing to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 41\u201324.\n\nBetween the 2002 and 2003 seasons, McNair was arrested for DUI and illegal gun possession (in May 2003). His blood alcohol was above 0.10, and a 9-mm handgun had been sitting in the front of the car.<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/7518506 Judge: Officer didn't have 'sufficient basis' to stop McNair for DUI].

McNair finished the 2003 season as the league leader in [[passer rating]] and became the youngest player in NFL history to pass for 20,000 yards and run for 3,000 yards.\n\n====2004\u20132005 seasons====\nMcNair missed the 2004 season's fourth game with a bruised sternum, an injury suffered the previous week against Jacksonville,<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2004/09/27/McNair-hospitalized-with-bruised-sternum/UPI-14731096324472/ McNair hospitalized with bruised sternum].
