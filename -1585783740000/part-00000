It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the \"Flying Shingle\" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an MG Special, and novice driver, actor [[James Dean]] in a [[Porsche 356]] Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's [[Porsche 550]] Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raskin|first=Lee|title=James Dean: At Speed|year=2005|publisher=David Bull|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=978-1893618497|page=70}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1957 season (in co-operation with Otto Zipper), Miles engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as \"the Pooper\", the first being an early 1950s Cooper chassis and body powered by a Porsche 356 power train that was built and campaigned by [[Pete Lovely]] of Tacoma, Washington. The resulting car dominated the F Modified class of SCCA on the west coast in the 1957 and 1958 seasons with Miles driving.\n\nDue to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a key member of the [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]/[[AC Cobra|Cobra]] race team in the early 1960s. Miles described himself this way:<ref>Baime, A.J.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PqhXAwAAQBAJ Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans]'', p. 214 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).</ref>\n<blockquote>I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others.  I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like.  I should think it would be jolly good fun!</blockquote>\n\nWith a very pronounced Brummie accent (from his hometown of Birmingham, renowned for car manufacturing) combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour, he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as \"Teddy Teabag\" (for his tea drinking) or \"Sidebite\" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth). He played a key role in the development and success of the racing versions of the [[AC Cobra#AC 289 Sports|Shelby Cobra 289]] in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the [[Shelby Daytona|Daytona Coupe]] and 427 versions of the Cobra and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT (GT40)]].\n\nHe became the chief test driver of [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] in 1963.<ref name=passaic />\n\nMiles had a \"reputation for courtesy on the track\" and was sometimes called the \"Stirling Moss of the West Coast\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biographical Sketches of Drivers|last=Canadian Racing Drivers Association|date=1964|work=Player's 200 Media Kit}}</ref> While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a [[Lotus 23]] in the 1964 Player's 200 at [[Mosport]]. [[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|GT40 Mk II rear]]\n\nIn 1965, he shared a [[Ford GT40#Mk II|Ford GT Mk.II]] with [[Bruce McLaren]] at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe next year he won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], sharing the Ford GT Mk.II with [[Lloyd Ruby]], and then won the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Several months later, sharing the drive with [[Denny Hulme]], Miles was leading the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together, instructed [[Carroll Shelby]] to order him to slow down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/[[Chris Amon]] and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146340/hartford_courant/|title=McLaren, Amon Win at LeMans|newspaper=Hartford Courant|location=Hartford, Connecticut|date=20 June 1966|page=21|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat \"photo-finish\", reneged during the final hour of the race. After first declaring Ken Miles and Denny Hulme the winner, the decision was reversed. Since the Ford driven by McLaren/Amon who finished #2 had started some 20 yards behind the Miles/Hulme #1 Car, it had travelled a further distance, and Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were declared the winners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146062/daily_independent_journal/|title=Fords Humiliate Mighty Ferraris in Le Mans Race|agency=Associated Press|date=20 June 1966|newspaper=Daily Independent Journal|location=San Rafael, California|via=Newspapers.com|page=29}}</ref> Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.\n\n==Death==\nThe Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the all-conquering Ford GT40 Mk.II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of [[Walt Hansgen]] in a J-car Ford while testing at Le Mans in April, the decision was made to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs, and little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with [[Kammback]] aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproved with high-speed prototype sports cars.\n\nAfter almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were greatly modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The death of 47-year-old Miles, following that of 46-year-old Hansgen, led Ford to favour younger drivers in subsequent race entries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The significantly revised J-car, renamed the [[Ford GT40#Mk IV|Ford Mk IV]], won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of [[Mario Andretti]], who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMiles is interred at the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum of the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nMiles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/ken-miles.html Ken Miles] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n===USAC Road Racing Championship results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the \"Flying Shingle\" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an MG Special, and novice driver, actor [[James Dean]] in a [[Porsche 356]] Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's [[Porsche 550]] Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raskin|first=Lee|title=James Dean: At Speed|year=2005|publisher=David Bull|location=Phoenix, Ariz.|isbn=978-1893618497|page=70}}</ref>\n\nFor the 1957 season (in co-operation with Otto Zipper), Miles engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and transmission in a 1956 [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] chassis and body. It was the second successful race car to be known on the West Coast as \"the Pooper\", the first being an early 1950s Cooper chassis and body powered by a Porsche 356 power train that was built and campaigned by [[Pete Lovely]] of Tacoma, Washington. The resulting car dominated the F Modified class of SCCA on the west coast in the 1957 and 1958 seasons with Miles driving.\n\nDue to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a key member of the [[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]/[[AC Cobra|Cobra]] race team in the early 1960s. Miles described himself this way:<ref>Baime, A.J.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PqhXAwAAQBAJ Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans]'', p. 214 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).</ref>\n<blockquote>I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to others.  I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see what it is like.  I should think it would be jolly good fun!</blockquote>\n\nWith a very pronounced Brummie accent (from his hometown of Birmingham, renowned for car manufacturing) combined with a seemingly obscure and sardonic sense of humour, he was affectionately known by his American racing crew as \"Teddy Teabag\" (for his tea drinking) or \"Sidebite\" (as he talked out of the side of his mouth). He played a key role in the development and success of the racing versions of the [[AC Cobra#AC 289 Sports|Shelby Cobra 289]] in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the [[Shelby Daytona|Daytona Coupe]] and 427 versions of the Cobra and the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT (GT40)]].\n\nHe became the chief test driver of [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] in 1963.<ref name=passaic />\n\nMiles had a \"reputation for courtesy on the track\" and was sometimes called the \"Stirling Moss of the West Coast\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Biographical Sketches of Drivers|last=Canadian Racing Drivers Association|date=1964|work=Player's 200 Media Kit}}</ref> While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a [[Lotus 23]] in the 1964 Player's 200 at [[Mosport]]. [[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|right|GT40 Mk II rear]]\n\nIn 1965, he shared a [[Ford GT40#Mk II|Ford GT Mk.II]] with [[Bruce McLaren]] at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nThe next year he won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], sharing the Ford GT Mk.II with [[Lloyd Ruby]], and then won the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. Several months later, sharing the drive with [[Denny Hulme]], Miles was leading the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the finish line together, instructed [[Carroll Shelby]] to order him to slow down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford driven by Bruce McLaren/[[Chris Amon]] and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146340/hartford_courant/|title=McLaren, Amon Win at LeMans|newspaper=Hartford Courant|location=Hartford, Connecticut|date=20 June 1966|page=21|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat \"photo-finish\", reneged during the final hour of the race. After first declaring Ken Miles and Denny Hulme the winner, the decision was reversed. Since the Ford driven by McLaren/Amon who finished #2 had started some 20 yards behind the Miles/Hulme #1 Car, it had travelled a further distance, and Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were declared the winners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39146062/daily_independent_journal/|title=Fords Humiliate Mighty Ferraris in Le Mans Race|agency=Associated Press|date=20 June 1966|newspaper=Daily Independent Journal|location=San Rafael, California|via=Newspapers.com|page=29}}</ref> Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.\n\n==Death==\nThe Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the all-conquering Ford GT40 Mk.II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of [[Walt Hansgen]] in a J-car Ford while testing at Le Mans in April, the decision was made to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs, and little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. Finally, in August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles serving as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section that experimented with [[Kammback]] aerodynamic theories, as well as a revolutionary (but untested) honeycomb panel design that was supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design remained unproved with high-speed prototype sports cars.\n\nAfter almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}}, downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly. The car had suffered precisely the sort of crash damage the honeycomb construction was designed to prevent. As a result, the aerodynamics of the J-car were greatly modified to correct the rear-end lift generated at race speeds. Ford officials, under pressure after the second of two fatal accidents in the program in five months, also ordered a NASCAR-style steel tube rollover cage to be installed in future versions of the car.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The death of 47-year-old Miles, following that of 46-year-old Hansgen, led Ford to favour younger drivers in subsequent race entries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The significantly revised J-car, renamed the [[Ford GT40#Mk IV|Ford Mk IV]], won the only two races in which it was entered: the 1967 Sebring (Fla.) 12 Hours, and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The steel roll cage in the Mk IV (mandated as a direct result of Miles's death) probably saved the life of [[Mario Andretti]], who crashed violently during the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans but escaped.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nMiles is interred at the Abbey of the Psalms Mausoleum of the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nMiles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/ken-miles.html Ken Miles] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n===USAC Road Racing Championship results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It is a suburb of the nearby city of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. The population was 7,526 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 6,120 in [[2000 United States Census|2000]]. Its name is derived from the Cajun French word for buzzard: the spot where the community was settled was one where large flocks of buzzards roosted in the bald cypress trees. The name means \"carrion crow.\"\n\nCarencro is part of the [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==Etymology==\nMany senior Carencro natives attest that the town's name originates from before the [[American Civil War]].  According to this local legend, [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native Americans]] told [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Vermilionville]] settlers that in old times a large number of \"carrion [[crows]]\" ([[vultures]], called ''carencro'' in [[French language|French]]) had settled around the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] between [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and [[Opelousas, Louisiana]] to feast on a [[fish die-off]].\n\nThere is a related theory, consistent with the spelling, that the place is named for the ''carencro t\u00eate rouge'', a red-headed [[buzzard]] referred to by [[Europe]]an explorers as early as 1699, and described in 1774 by [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz]].  Du Pratz described the bird as having black plumage and a head covered with red flesh.  He said the [[Spain|Spanish]] government protected the birds, ''\"for as they do not use the whole carcass of the buffaloes which (the [[Spaniards]]) kill, those birds eat what they leave, which otherwise, by rotting on the ground, would ... infect the air.\"'' <ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Carencro.htm Jim Bradshaw, \"Carencro name comes from old Attakapas legend\"], ''Lafayette (LA) Daily Advertiser'', January 27, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written on April 23, 1802, Martin Duralde, a former commandant of the [[Opelousas]] post, related the legend as it had come down from an Attakapas Indian.  Duralde wrote:<blockquote> \"Many years before the discovery of the elephant in the bayou called {{sic|Carancro}} an Attakapas savage had informed a man who is at present in my service in the capacity of cow-herd that the ancestors of his nation transmitted (the story) to their descendants that a beast of enormous size had perished either in this bayou or in one of the two water courses a short distance from it without their being able to indicate the true place, the antiquity of the event having without doubt made them forget it.\"</blockquote> (Note: The mastodon became extinct 4500\u201310,000 years ago, in part because of overhunting by American Indians.)\n\nA late 19th-century account stated the legend came from buzzards (vultures) feasting on a [[mastodon]] carcass. Its fossilized bones were reportedly discovered and collected by a [[France|French]] [[naturalist]] in the 18th century and shipped to the [[Jardin des Plantes]] of [[Paris]], but the ship was wrecked on the way, and the bones were lost at sea.  The only relic of the mastodon was a femur or leg bone, which was kept by an early settler, the first Guilbeau.  He used it as a pestle to bruise [[indigo]] for processing, a crop then cultivated in the [[Attakapas|Attakapas Indian]] country.  The Indians termed the birds ''carecros''; and from the spot where the mastodon died, the river takes the name of [[Bayou Carencro]].<ref>[http://carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/Cajun/Buzzard.htm \"How Buzzard's Prairie Got Its Name\"], reprinted in the ''Lafayette (LA) Daily Advertiser'' from the ''Lafayette (LA) Gazette'', May 22, 1897.</ref>\n\nFirst called St. Pierre, in the late 19th century, the town was renamed Carencro, after the \"carrion crow\" (vulture) legend.  Although Carencro's current town center lies well west of the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]], this legend has permanence within the community.\n\nSome people think that the name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''carnero'', meaning \"bone pile.\"  This idea also comes from the mastodon legend, and the idea that the buzzards left nothing but a pile of white bones after they had picked the mastodon clean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early settlement===\nFew European people settled in the Carencro area (around [[Lafayette, LA|Lafayette]]) until the coming of the [[Acadian]] refugees in the 18th century.  Some of the Acadians transported in 1765 to the Attakapas district were given lands along Bayou Carencro, although probably not in what is now the town of Carencro.  At that time, Jean and Marin Mouton, Charles Peck, Louis Pierre Arceneaux and others began to establish ''[[vacheries]]'' in the vicinity.  More cattlemen would follow after 1770, when Spanish Gov. [[Alejandro O'Reilly]] (English: '''Alexander O'Reilly''') decreed that \"a grant of 42 [[arpent]]s [{{convert|42|arpent|acre|disp=output only}}] in front by 42 in depth could be issued only to those who owned 100 head of tame cattle, some sheep and horses, and two slaves to oversee them.\"\n\nIn 1769, Juan Kelly and Eduardo Nugent toured the area for the government and reported to O'Reilly that \"the inhabitants maintain everything imaginable in the way of livestock, such as cows, horses and sheep.\"  A [[Frenchman]] named Lyonnet, visiting in 1793, found thousands of cattle on the [[Attakapas]] and Opelousas prairies.\n\nJean and Marin Mouton were among the early settlers on Bayou Carencro. Other early settlers in the Carencro area were Charles Peck, Traveille Bernard, Rosamond Breaux, Ovignar Arceneaux, and the Babineaux family.  An 1803 census of the Carencro area listed family names including Arceneaux, Babineaux, Benoit, Bernard, Breaux, Carmouche, Caruthers, Comeaux, Cormier, Guilbeaux, H\u00e9bert, Holway, LeBlanc, Melan\u00e7on, Mire, Mouton, Pierre, Prejean, Roger, St. Julien, Savoie, and Thibodeaux.\n\n===First post office===\nThe first post office in Carencro was established on January 11, 1872, with Auguste Melchior as postmaster.  The telegraph line reached there in 1884.  The first telephones were installed by the Teche and Vermilion Telephone Line in 1894.  The company was headquartered in [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].\n\n===Historic churches===\n[[Image:StPetersChurchFront-Carencro.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown facing St. Peter's church.]]\nAccording to Roger Baudier's history of the Catholic Church of Louisiana, the Carencro area was first served from [[Grand Coteau, Louisiana]], later from Vermilionville, and then from [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana]].  The parish of St. Peter was established in 1874 and the archdiocese sent Father Andre Marie Guillot as its first pastor.  The church was at first called ''St. Pierre au Carencro'', named for Pierre Cormier, who donated land for the first church.   Before a church was established at Carencro, services were held in the Carmouche blacksmith shop.  Father Guillot died of [[yellow fever]] while serving in Carencro and was buried in the church cemetery.\n\nAccording to Baudier, \"(Father Guillot's) successor was Father J.F Suriray.   Trouble with the parishioners arose and Father Suriray was threatened by the people.  Some three years after his coming to Carencro, he was obliged to leave.   Some time after, the church was destroyed by fire and the parish remained without a pastor until 1883.\"\n\nA new church was built in 1893, but was destroyed by a tornado before it was ever used.  Another church was built, and it burned in 1904.   The current church was built in 1906 under the administration of Father F.J. Grimeaux, who served the parish for some 25 years.  A plaque outside notes the donation of the land by the Jean Jacques Coussan family.  A young carpenter named Hector Connolly worked for $2.50 a day to build the 110-foot steeple.  Father Grimeaux, in addition to serving as pastor, organized and played clarinet in the Carencro Brass Band.\n\nThe Church of the Assumption was completed in 1925 to serve a black congregation.  The Holy Ghost Fathers accepted an invitation to direct the parish and sent Father Joseph Dolan as the first pastor.  Assumption Church continues to operate today with its original structure still intact and is the only white, wood frame structure of its kind in the Diocese of Lafayette.\n\nOur Lady of the Assumption Religious Complex consists of the church, rectory, school, Drexel Parish Hall (former Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament Convent), the church cemetery, and St. Katharine Drexel Shrine.  The complex was listed on the State and National Register of Historic Places in November 2001.\n\n===Historic schools===\nAssumption School was built in 1932 and was staffed by the [[Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament]].  Assumption School was the combination of several black schools in the area.  The school was operated with finances from Saint Katharine Drexel.  After the 1950s, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament taught at Carencro Catholic School, located at the west end of Church Street.  In the early 1980s, Assumption School Combined with St. Pierre School to form Carencro Catholic.\n\nAbout the turn of the century, Father J.B. Laforet sold three lots to Mother St. Patrick of the Sisters of Mount Carmel, who opened St. Ann's School of Carencro, in 1897.\n\nIn 1874, what was probably the first school in Carencro, was opened on the Auguste Melchior farm. Melchior, a Frenchman who had come here from [[New Orleans]], was named director of the [[Lafayette Parish]] educational system about 1870. His wife, Viviana, taught at the Carencro school.\n\nIn 1889, Carencro had two private schools.  Charles Heichelheim, a German, ran a school for boys, and Edmond Vill\u00e9re operated one for both boys and girls.  That year, the first public school was built in Carencro, and a second story was added to it 10 years later.  The school became an approved high school about 1917.\n\n===Economic prosperity===\n''The Opelousas Courier'' reported on the young settlement at least twice during the year 1879.  The April 19 edition stated, ''\"This little village is rapidly expanding. ... The grounds of the church have been planted in trees and enclosed with a fence of a new kind.  This enclosure is of iron wire and armed with steel barbs, forming a barrier inaccessible to animals.\" ''\n[[Image:StPeters-Carencrotower.jpg|thumb|left|St. Peters Catholic church next to the town's water tower.]]\nOn September 6, the newspaper gave this account: ''\"The little village of St. Pierre, at Carencro, born only a short time ago, tends to stretch itself in an astonishing fashion with numbers of buildings where all kinds of trades and professions are prospering there.   Many beautiful stores, well assorted with that which meets the needs of the inhabitants, are established there since a short time ago and we note, among others, the fine establishment of Mr. Ignace Bernard near the church.\" ''\n\nBy 1889, Carencro had two sugar factories, one operated by J.C. Couvillon, and another run by I. Singleton.  In 1894, Victor E. Dupuis, one of the larger cane growers of the area, formed the Carencro Sugar Company to build another sugar mill alongside Morgan's Railroad.  The sugar mills in the area closed about 1900.\n\nThere were several horse-powered cotton gins in Carencro before 1876, but, in that year, Avignac Arceneaux built the first steam-powered gin in the parish. Four more gins went up there in the late 1880s and in the 1890s.  In 1889, 1,800 bales of cotton were shipped from the Carencro Station.  Cotton gins continued to operate in Carencro until the middle 1970s, when the last two, Cotton Products Co. and Farmer's Gin Co., were closed.\n\n====Merchants and plantation owners====\nAmong leading merchants in the 1890s were the Brown Brothers, Jacob Mitchell, D. Daret, A.G. Guilbeau, G. Schmuler, C. Micou, and J.C. Martin.  People owning large plantations near the town were Mrs. Z. Broussard, Dr. R.J. Francez, Mrs. O.C. Mouton, Louis Roger, Mrs. F. Abadie, C.C. Brown, St. Clair Kilchrist, V.C. Dupuis. and L.J. Arceneaux. Entrepreneur Charles J. Richard opened the town's lumberyard along the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].  Nearly 100 years later, the enterprise closed during a regional economic recession in 1985.\n\nIn 1891, historian William Henry Perrin suggested that ''\"there is no prettier site for a town (than Carencro) nor one with more solid advantages than comprised in this place. \"'' <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Modern===\n[[Image:Hector Connoly Road - Carencro, Louisiana (2018-01-03) (crop).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Roadside businesses along Hector Connoly Road at [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]] Frontage Road.]]\nCarencro's St. Peter's Catholic Church and cemetery form an artistic centerpiece of the town.

It is a suburb of the nearby city of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. The population was 7,526 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 6,120 in [[2000 United States Census|2000]]. Its name is derived from the Cajun French word for buzzard: the spot where the community was settled was one where large flocks of buzzards roosted in the bald cypress trees. The name means \"carrion crow.\"\n\nCarencro is part of the [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==Etymology==\nMany senior Carencro natives attest that the town's name originates from before the [[American Civil War]].  According to this local legend, [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native Americans]] told [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Vermilionville]] settlers that in old times a large number of \"carrion [[crows]]\" ([[vultures]], called ''carencro'' in [[French language|French]]) had settled around the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] between [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and [[Opelousas, Louisiana]] to feast on a [[fish die-off]].\n\nThere is a related theory, consistent with the spelling, that the place is named for the ''carencro t\u00eate rouge'', a red-headed [[buzzard]] referred to by [[Europe]]an explorers as early as 1699, and described in 1774 by [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz]].  Du Pratz described the bird as having black plumage and a head covered with red flesh.  He said the [[Spain|Spanish]] government protected the birds, ''\"for as they do not use the whole carcass of the buffaloes which (the [[Spaniards]]) kill, those birds eat what they leave, which otherwise, by rotting on the ground, would ... infect the air.\"'' <ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Carencro.htm Jim Bradshaw, \"Carencro name comes from old Attakapas legend\"], ''Lafayette (LA) Daily Advertiser'', January 27, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn a letter written on April 23, 1802, Martin Duralde, a former commandant of the [[Opelousas]] post, related the legend as it had come down from an Attakapas Indian.  Duralde wrote:<blockquote> \"Many years before the discovery of the elephant in the bayou called {{sic|Carancro}} an Attakapas savage had informed a man who is at present in my service in the capacity of cow-herd that the ancestors of his nation transmitted (the story) to their descendants that a beast of enormous size had perished either in this bayou or in one of the two water courses a short distance from it without their being able to indicate the true place, the antiquity of the event having without doubt made them forget it.\"</blockquote> (Note: The mastodon became extinct 4500-10,000 years ago, in part because of overhunting by American Indians.)\n\nA late 19th-century account stated the legend came from buzzards (vultures) feasting on a [[mastodon]] carcass. Its fossilized bones were reportedly discovered and collected by a [[France|French]] [[naturalist]] in the 18th century and shipped to the [[Jardin des Plantes]] of [[Paris]], but the ship was wrecked on the way, and the bones were lost at sea.  The only relic of the mastodon was a femur or leg bone, which was kept by an early settler, the first Guilbeau.  He used it as a pestle to bruise [[indigo]] for processing, a crop then cultivated in the [[Attakapas|Attakapas Indian]] country.  The Indians termed the birds ''carecros''; and from the spot where the mastodon died, the river takes the name of [[Bayou Carencro]].<ref>[http://carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/Cajun/Buzzard.htm \"How Buzzard's Prairie Got Its Name\"], reprinted in the ''Lafayette (LA) Daily Advertiser'' from the ''Lafayette (LA) Gazette'', May 22, 1897.</ref>\n\nFirst called St. Pierre, in the late 19th century, the town was renamed Carencro, after the \"carrion crow\" (vulture) legend.  Although Carencro's current town center lies well west of the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]], this legend has permanence within the community.\n\nSome people think that the name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''carnero'', meaning \"bone pile.\"  This idea also comes from the mastodon legend, and the idea that the buzzards left nothing but a pile of white bones after they had picked the mastodon clean.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early settlement===\nFew European people settled in the Carencro area (around [[Lafayette, LA|Lafayette]]) until the coming of the [[Acadian]] refugees in the 18th century.  Some of the Acadians transported in 1765 to the Attakapas district were given lands along Bayou Carencro, although probably not in what is now the town of Carencro.  At that time, Jean and Marin Mouton, Charles Peck, Louis Pierre Arceneaux and others began to establish ''[[vacheries]]'' in the vicinity.  More cattlemen would follow after 1770, when Spanish Gov. [[Alejandro O'Reilly]] (English: '''Alexander O'Reilly''') decreed that \"a grant of 42 [[arpent]]s [{{convert|42|arpent|acre|disp=output only}}] in front by 42 in depth could be issued only to those who owned 100 head of tame cattle, some sheep and horses, and two slaves to oversee them.\"\n\nIn 1769, Juan Kelly and Eduardo Nugent toured the area for the government and reported to O'Reilly that \"the inhabitants maintain everything imaginable in the way of livestock, such as cows, horses and sheep.\"  A [[Frenchman]] named Lyonnet, visiting in 1793, found thousands of cattle on the [[Attakapas]] and Opelousas prairies.\n\nJean and Marin Mouton were among the early settlers on Bayou Carencro. Other early settlers in the Carencro area were Charles Peck, Traveille Bernard, Rosamond Breaux, Ovignar Arceneaux, and the Babineaux family.  An 1803 census of the Carencro area listed family names including Arceneaux, Babineaux, Benoit, Bernard, Breaux, Carmouche, Caruthers, Comeaux, Cormier, Guilbeaux, H\u00e9bert, Holway, LeBlanc, Melan\u00e7on, Mire, Mouton, Pierre, Prejean, Roger, St. Julien, Savoie, and Thibodeaux.\n\n===First post office===\nThe first post office in Carencro was established on January 11, 1872, with Auguste Melchior as postmaster.  The telegraph line reached there in 1884.  The first telephones were installed by the Teche and Vermilion Telephone Line in 1894.  The company was headquartered in [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].\n\n===Historic churches===\n[[Image:StPetersChurchFront-Carencro.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown facing St. Peter's church.]]\nAccording to Roger Baudier's history of the Catholic Church of Louisiana, the Carencro area was first served from [[Grand Coteau, Louisiana]], later from Vermilionville, and then from [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana]].  The parish of St. Peter was established in 1874 and the archdiocese sent Father Andre Marie Guillot as its first pastor.  The church was at first called ''St. Pierre au Carencro'', named for Pierre Cormier, who donated land for the first church.   Before a church was established at Carencro, services were held in the Carmouche blacksmith shop.  Father Guillot died of [[yellow fever]] while serving in Carencro and was buried in the church cemetery.\n\nAccording to Baudier, \"(Father Guillot's) successor was Father J.F Suriray.   Trouble with the parishioners arose and Father Suriray was threatened by the people.  Some three years after his coming to Carencro, he was obliged to leave.   Some time after, the church was destroyed by fire and the parish remained without a pastor until 1883.\"\n\nA new church was built in 1893, but was destroyed by a tornado before it was ever used.  Another church was built, and it burned in 1904.   The current church was built in 1906 under the administration of Father F.J. Grimeaux, who served the parish for some 25 years.  A plaque outside notes the donation of the land by the Jean Jacques Coussan family.  A young carpenter named Hector Connolly worked for $2.50 a day to build the 110-foot steeple.  Father Grimeaux, in addition to serving as pastor, organized and played clarinet in the Carencro Brass Band.\n\nThe Church of the Assumption was completed in 1925 to serve a black congregation.  The Holy Ghost Fathers accepted an invitation to direct the parish and sent Father Joseph Dolan as the first pastor.  Assumption Church continues to operate today with its original structure still intact and is the only white, wood frame structure of its kind in the Diocese of Lafayette.\n\nOur Lady of the Assumption Religious Complex consists of the church, rectory, school, Drexel Parish Hall (former Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament Convent), the church cemetery, and St. Katharine Drexel Shrine.  The complex was listed on the State and National Register of Historic Places in November 2001.\n\n===Historic schools===\nAssumption School was built in 1932 and was staffed by the [[Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament]].  Assumption School was the combination of several black schools in the area.  The school was operated with finances from Saint Katharine Drexel.  After the 1950s, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament taught at Carencro Catholic School, located at the west end of Church Street.  In the early 1980s, Assumption School Combined with St. Pierre School to form Carencro Catholic.\n\nAbout the turn of the century, Father J.B. Laforet sold three lots to Mother St. Patrick of the Sisters of Mount Carmel, who opened St. Ann's School of Carencro, in 1897.\n\nIn 1874, what was probably the first school in Carencro, was opened on the Auguste Melchior farm. Melchior, a Frenchman who had come here from [[New Orleans]], was named director of the [[Lafayette Parish]] educational system about 1870. His wife, Viviana, taught at the Carencro school.\n\nIn 1889, Carencro had two private schools.  Charles Heichelheim, a German, ran a school for boys, and Edmond Vill\u00e9re operated one for both boys and girls.  That year, the first public school was built in Carencro, and a second story was added to it 10 years later.  The school became an approved high school about 1917.\n\n===Economic prosperity===\n''The Opelousas Courier'' reported on the young settlement at least twice during the year 1879.  The April 19 edition stated, ''\"This little village is rapidly expanding. ... The grounds of the church have been planted in trees and enclosed with a fence of a new kind.  This enclosure is of iron wire and armed with steel barbs, forming a barrier inaccessible to animals.\" ''\n[[Image:StPeters-Carencrotower.jpg|thumb|left|St. Peters Catholic church next to the town's water tower.]]\nOn September 6, the newspaper gave this account: ''\"The little village of St. Pierre, at Carencro, born only a short time ago, tends to stretch itself in an astonishing fashion with numbers of buildings where all kinds of trades and professions are prospering there.   Many beautiful stores, well assorted with that which meets the needs of the inhabitants, are established there since a short time ago and we note, among others, the fine establishment of Mr. Ignace Bernard near the church.\" ''\n\nBy 1889, Carencro had two sugar factories, one operated by J.C. Couvillon, and another run by I. Singleton.  In 1894, Victor E. Dupuis, one of the larger cane growers of the area, formed the Carencro Sugar Company to build another sugar mill alongside Morgan's Railroad.  The sugar mills in the area closed about 1900.\n\nThere were several horse-powered cotton gins in Carencro before 1876, but, in that year, Avignac Arceneaux built the first steam-powered gin in the parish. Four more gins went up there in the late 1880s and in the 1890s.  In 1889, 1,800 bales of cotton were shipped from the Carencro Station.  Cotton gins continued to operate in Carencro until the middle 1970s, when the last two, Cotton Products Co. and Farmer's Gin Co., were closed.\n\n====Merchants and plantation owners====\nAmong leading merchants in the 1890s were the Brown Brothers, Jacob Mitchell, D. Daret, A.G. Guilbeau, G. Schmuler, C. Micou, and J.C. Martin.  People owning large plantations near the town were Mrs. Z. Broussard, Dr. R.J. Francez, Mrs. O.C. Mouton, Louis Roger, Mrs. F. Abadie, C.C. Brown, St. Clair Kilchrist, V.C. Dupuis. and L.J. Arceneaux. Entrepreneur Charles J. Richard opened the town's lumberyard along the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].  Nearly 100 years later, the enterprise closed during a regional economic recession in 1985.\n\nIn 1891, historian William Henry Perrin suggested that ''\"there is no prettier site for a town (than Carencro) nor one with more solid advantages than comprised in this place. \"'' <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Modern===\n[[Image:Hector Connoly Road - Carencro, Louisiana (2018-01-03) (crop).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Roadside businesses along Hector Connoly Road at [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]] Frontage Road.]]\nCarencro's St. Peter's Catholic Church and cemetery form an artistic centerpiece of the town.  St. Peter's Catholic Church has an ornate cypress-carved entrance, altar and narthex, as well as intricate pew end caps.  The pews were once sold to parishioners to raise money for the church.

The bird that can be found on the coat of arms of the Karolyi family.\n\nKing [[Louis I of Hungary]] permitted the organization of weekly market gatherings in Carei in 1346, as a result of the military achievements of the K\u00e1rolyi family.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/09500/09536/html/0020/8.html Ujfalussy Amadil: ''Nagyk\u00e1roly'']</ref> The development of regional trade in the region stimulated the development of the town.\n\nIn the 14th century, the settlement was a small township with a few streets built around the K\u00e1rolyi estate.\nWars, plague and famine during the Middle Ages decimated the population and the K\u00e1rolyi family took steps to bring [[Sathmar Swabians|Swabian]] settlers to their lands. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Carei was often devastated by wars. The town and the surroundings villages suffered great losses during [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence]].\n\nThe first group of settlers came in 1712, opening a century-long period of gradual colonization with Swabians, Slovaks, and Jews. Between 1712\u20131774,466 Swabian families are settled down in Carei, forming two districts in town.  Effects on cultural and social life began to show: in 1727 the [[Piarists|Piarist]] Gymnasium was established, in 1754 the first typography was built, and in 1756 a pharmacy was opened.\n\nThe town's urban shape was outlined after the great fire that occurred in May 1887, when 250 houses were burnt down. The rebuilding of the houses and the organizing of the streets are done according to the town planning regulations adopted by the town's council.\n\nThe [[light industry]] began to bloom in the town starting with the 19th century, when the first public institutions {{Which|date=November 2009}} were also created.\n\nIn 1887 the Zal\u0103u-Carei railway was built and in 1905 the one between Carei and [[M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka]] was restored for transportation purposes.\n\nAfter the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] at the end of [[World War I]], Carei became part of the territory ceded to Romania in 1920 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1940, under the auspices of the [[Third Reich]], which imposed the [[Second Vienna Award]], Hungary retook this territory from Romania. During [[World War II]], however, it was taken back from Hungarian and [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops by Romanian and Soviet forces on 25 October 1944, day which has been celebrated since as the [[Armed Forces Day#Romania|Day of the Romanian Armed Forces]].\n\nAlthough between 1760 and 1920 the town was the seat of Szatmar county, the industrial development is not significant and it basically preserves its agricultural specific until about 1960. In 1926 it was attached to S\u0103laj county. After 1945, Carei is included in the Baia Mare district, and after 1968, along with the administrative-territorial reorganization of the country, it returns to Satu Mare county.\n\nUntil World War II, the industry of the town consisted of mills, the Oil Factory ''Ardealul'', a station for collecting and fermenting tobacco and some small workshops. During the Communist period, Carei gradually turned into an industrial town.\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe most important historical building in the city is the K\u00e1rolyi castle. Built originally as a fortress around the 14th century, it was converted to a castle in 1794, undergoing further transformations during the 19th century.

Cardross is in the historic geographical county of [[Dunbartonshire]] but the modern political local authority of [[Argyll and Bute]].\n\nCardross Village took its name from the historic [[parish]] in which it is located and where King [[Robert the Bruce]] lived the final years of his life. The Parish of Cardross stretched in area from the River Leven on the west side of Dumbarton to Camus Eskan (near Helensburgh), and stretched as far north to include the village of [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]] in the [[Vale of Leven]].\n\nThe distinction between Cardross village and Cardross Parish is particularly important for students of Scottish history. King Robert the Bruce's documented association with \u2019Cardross\u2019 occurred three centuries prior to the existence of the modern-day village, and at a time when the name referred to the ecclesiastical parish and its church, Cardross Kirk.\n\nThe original piece of land known as \u2019Cardross\u2019 is at the eastern edge of the historic parish and the western point of the confluence of the rivers Clyde and Leven at the town of [[Dumbarton]], facing across to Dumbarton Rock and Castle. Today the land is known as \u201csand point\u201d and sits on the edge of Dumbarton's Levengrove Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/parks-and-greenspaces/parks/levengrove-park/|title=Levengrove Park}}</ref> The site of medieval Cardross Kirk, and its remains, sits within Levengrove Park.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Cardross'' is a name of [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] origin.<ref name=\"bliton\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |url=http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |website=SPNS - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813011121/http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first part of the name is the Brittonic or [[Pictish language|Pictish]] ''*carden'', generally meaning \"a wild place, a thicket\" ([[Middle Welsh]] ''cardden'').<ref name=\"bliton\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Place Names - C - E |url=http://www.parliament.scot/Gaelic/placenamesC-E.pdf |website=The Scottish Parliament - P\u00e0rlamaid na h-Alba |accessdate=2 February 2019}}</ref> The second is the element ''-r\u014ds'', \"moor, promontory\" ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''rhos'').<ref name=\"bliton\" /> In other words, a thicketed promontory of land.\n\n==History==\nThe settlement of Cardross developed around a 17th-century church. The mother kirk of Cardross Parish was relocated in 1653, {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} west from its medieval site on the western bank of the River Leven to support a fledgling ferry community on the northern bank of the [[River Clyde]].\n\nModern-day \u2018Ferry Road\u2019 runs the short distance between the A814 and the River Clyde at the easternmost extremity of Cardross Village (closest to Dumbarton).\n\nThe new settlement eventually took its name from the church, and the parish that it served, as the 17th-century worshippers headed for the re-located \u2018Cardross\u2019 every Sunday.\n\nToday no remains of that original Cardross Village church can be found but the Graveyard is still in use and contains several 17th-century gravestones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/cardross-p235071|title=Cardross Visitor Guide - Accommodation, Things To Do & More|website=www.visitscotland.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert the Bruce]] purchased the portions of lands of Pillanflatt from the [[Earl of Lennox]], lying on the western bank of the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire]], in the Parish of Cardross, in 1326.

Cardross is in the historic geographical county of [[Dunbartonshire]] but the modern political local authority of [[Argyll and Bute]].\n\nCardross Village took its name from the historic [[parish]] in which it is located and where King [[Robert the Bruce]] lived the final years of his life. The Parish of Cardross stretched in area from the River Leven on the west side of Dumbarton to Camus Eskan (near Helensburgh), and stretched as far north to include the village of [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]] in the [[Vale of Leven]].\n\nThe distinction between Cardross village and Cardross Parish is particularly important for students of Scottish history. King Robert the Bruce\u2019s documented association with \u2019Cardross\u2019 occurred three centuries prior to the existence of the modern-day village, and at a time when the name referred to the ecclesiastical parish and its church, Cardross Kirk.\n\nThe original piece of land known as \u2019Cardross\u2019 is at the eastern edge of the historic parish and the western point of the confluence of the rivers Clyde and Leven at the town of [[Dumbarton]], facing across to Dumbarton Rock and Castle. Today the land is known as \u201csand point\u201d and sits on the edge of Dumbarton\u2019s Levengrove Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/parks-and-greenspaces/parks/levengrove-park/|title=Levengrove Park}}</ref> The site of medieval Cardross Kirk, and its remains, sits within Levengrove Park.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Cardross'' is a name of [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] origin.<ref name=\"bliton\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |url=http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |website=SPNS - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813011121/http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first part of the name is the Brittonic or [[Pictish language|Pictish]] ''*carden'', generally meaning \"a wild place, a thicket\" ([[Middle Welsh]] ''cardden'').<ref name=\"bliton\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Place Names - C - E |url=http://www.parliament.scot/Gaelic/placenamesC-E.pdf |website=The Scottish Parliament - P\u00e0rlamaid na h-Alba |accessdate=2 February 2019}}</ref> The second is the element ''-r\u014ds'', \"moor, promontory\" ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''rhos'').<ref name=\"bliton\" /> In other words, a thicketed promontory of land.\n\n==History==\nThe settlement of Cardross developed around a 17th-century church. The mother kirk of Cardross Parish was relocated in 1653, {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} west from its medieval site on the western bank of the River Leven to support a fledgling ferry community on the northern bank of the [[River Clyde]].\n\nModern-day \u2018Ferry Road\u2019 runs the short distance between the A814 and the River Clyde at the easternmost extremity of Cardross Village (closest to Dumbarton).\n\nThe new settlement eventually took its name from the church, and the parish that it served, as the 17th-century worshippers headed for the re-located \u2018Cardross\u2019 every Sunday.\n\nToday no remains of that original Cardross Village church can be found but the Graveyard is still in use and contains several 17th-century gravestones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/cardross-p235071|title=Cardross Visitor Guide - Accommodation, Things To Do & More|website=www.visitscotland.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert the Bruce]] purchased the portions of lands of Pillanflatt from the [[Earl of Lennox]], lying on the western bank of the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire]], in the Parish of Cardross, in 1326.

They manufactured the balloons at [[Hove, Sussex]], in premises above the acoustic laboratory run by a third brother, Horace (2 July 1872 \u2013 6 April 1917). In 1903, when Horace left to work on steam turbine development with [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], Eustace and Oswald moved their workshop to rented accommodation in London, then again to railway arches in [[Battersea]], conveniently situated next to Battersea gas-works. \n\nIn 1905, they won a contract for three balloons for the [[British Indian Army]]. The quality of their work impressed Colonel [[James Templer (balloon aviator)|James Templer]], superintendent of the [[Royal Balloon Factory]], who introduced the brothers to [[Charles Rolls]]. Rolls commissioned them to build him a large balloon to compete in the 1906 [[Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)|Gordon Bennett Cup balloon race]]. More orders soon followed from other members of the [[Aero Club of Great Britain]] (later Royal Aero Club).<ref>Barnes 1967, pp. 1\u20136</ref>\n\nIn 1908, on hearing reports from Aero Club members who had seen the [[Wright brothers]]' demonstrations of their aircraft at [[Le Mans]] in France, Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace, \"This is the finish of ballooning: we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can't do that without Horace!\"<ref>Barnes 1967, p. 6</ref> Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to leave his job with Parsons, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. Two orders for aircraft were soon received, one from Charles Rolls, who ordered a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], and the other from [[Francis McClean]], a member of the Aero Club who later bought several more aircraft from Short Brothers, and also acted as an unpaid test-pilot. At the end of 1908 Horace started work on the two designs, and in early 1909 construction was started of McClean's aircraft, the [[Short No.1 biplane]]. In March 1909 it was exhibited, without its fabric covering, at the first British Aero Show held at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]]. Meanwhile, the brothers had obtained the British rights to build copies of the [[Wright Model A|Wright design]].<ref>Barnes, pp. 6\u20138</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Hibernia first ship aircraft takeoff 1912 IWM Q 71041.jpg|thumb|Commander [[Charles Rumney Samson|C.

This had been acquired by the Aero Club for use as a flying ground, together with Mussell Manor (now known as \"Muswell Manor\"), which became its clubhouse. Construction of an initial batch of six aircraft was started immediately. Short Brothers thus became the first aircraft manufacturing company in the world to undertake volume production of an aircraft design. Here the [[Dunne D.5]], the first [[tailless aircraft]], was also built under contract.  In 1910 the Royal Aero Club and Short Brothers moved to a larger and less marshy ground at [[Eastchurch airfield|Eastchurch]], about 2.5 miles (4&nbsp;km) away. At this time the Royal Aero Club had offered the Admiralty the use of the flying field and Frank McClean had agreed to act as an instructor, so beginning a close association between Short Brothers and the Naval Air Service, whose first pilots were trained using [[Short S.27]] pusher biplanes.\n\nIn 1911, Shorts built one of the world's first successful twin-engine aircraft, the [[Short S.27#Short Triple Twin|Triple Twin]]. Construction started on a long series of naval aircraft floatplanes, starting with the Short S.26.\n\nIn 1913, Gordon Bell became Shorts' first professional test pilot:  he was succeeded by Ronald Kemp in 1914. Kemp could not handle the volume of flight testing and development alone and, by 1916, other pilots were employed on a freelance basis. One of these was [[John Lankester Parker]]. In 1918 Parker succeeded Kemp as Shorts' Chief [[test pilot|Test Pilot]], a post he was to occupy for the next 27 years.<ref>Barnes 1967, pp. 8\u201312, 120</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a statue of the brothers was unveiled in memory of their contribution to early aviation, by local artist Barbara Street to stand on the site of the Aero Club clubhouse at Muswell manor. \n[[File:Short_Brothers_Statue.jpg|thumb|Short Brothers Statue at the site of their aero club (Musswell Manor, Isle of Sheppey)]]\n\n=== First World War ===\n[[File:Short 184.jpg|thumb|Short 184 floatplane]]\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]] Shorts were already building a variety of aircraft. Production really started to expand during the war, for example for the [[Short Type 184|Short Admiralty Type 184]] (or simply \"Short S.184\"). On 15 August 1915, during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], a Short S.184 was the first aircraft to attack a ship with a live torpedo. Flying from [[HMS Ben-my-Chree|HMS ''Ben-my-Chree'']], piloted by Flight Commander [[Charles Edmonds]], it hit a [[Turkey|Turkish]] supply ship in the [[Dardanelles]].<ref>The supply ship had already been hit by a torpedo from the submarine HMS E14 4 days earlier, and had run aground. See [[Short Type 184]] for further details</ref> In terms of number built, the S.184 was Shorts' most successful pre-[[World War II|Second World War]] aircraft: over 900 were produced, many under licence by other manufacturers. A landplane version of the S.184 was also sold to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as the [[Short Bomber]].<ref>Barnes 1967, p. 113</ref>\n\nDuring the First World War, Shorts were among the manufacturers of two flying boats, the [[Felixstowe F3|F.3]] and [[Felixstowe F5|F.5]], designed by [[John Cyril Porte|John Porte]] at the [[Seaplane Experimental Station]], Felixstowe. When the war ended, some 50 of these were being built at Rochester.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 16</ref>\n\n==== Expansion at Rochester ====\nDue to the company's success, and the increasing number of seaplanes being produced, larger premises with ready access to the sea were needed. At that time, seaplanes were taken by road to Queenborough, then loaded onto [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]] to be taken to the [[Royal Naval Air Service|RNAS]] seaplane station on [[Isle of Grain]] to be launched and tested.<ref name=Hanson>Hanson, Richard.

As this and the No.2 and No.3 shops became available, the workforce moved from the Eastchurch factory. No.3 shop was completed in 1917. A long concrete [[slipway]] was constructed from the centre-line of No.3 Erecting Shop to enable aircraft of up to 20 tons weight to be launched even at low tide.<ref name=Cassidy/>\n\n====Airships at Cardington====\nIn 1916, Short Brothers was awarded a contract to build two large [[dirigible]] [[airships]] for the [[Admiralty]]. As part of the contract, a loan was provided to enable the company to purchase a site near [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]], on which to build airship construction facilities. As a result, the company concentrated on the construction of heavier-than-air aeroplanes in the Isle of Sheppey/Rochester area, and balloons and dirigibles at Cardington. A housing estate built by the company near Cardington to house its employees still bears the name [[Shortstown]].<ref>Barnes & James 1989, p. 15</ref>\n\nIn 1919, the name of the company was changed to Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd., but nationalisation the same year ended the Short brothers' involvement with the company, which became the [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Royal Airship Works]].\n\n===The 1920s and 1930s===\nDuring the immediate post-war years the economic climate was difficult for the aircraft industry in the United Kingdom. Shorts survived without reducing the company's workforce by diversifying into areas such as building lightweight bus and tram bodies.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 19.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, [[flying boats]] were favoured for long-range civil aviation, because their operation did not rely on the existence of suitable airfields, which were not widespread at the time. Shorts took to the flying boat market, and in 1924 constructed a {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} testing tank for testing hull and float designs. Shorts designed the floats used for the [[Supermarine S.4]] and [[Gloster III]] seaplanes entered by the United Kingdom for the 1925 [[Schneider Trophy]] race. [[Alan Cobham]]'s [[de Havilland DH.50]] (G-EBFO) was also fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester. On 30 June 1926, Cobham then started a flight to Australia from the Medway. Two [[de Havilland Giant Moth]]s were fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester, and the first was flown in June 1928; both were delivered to Western Canada Airlines Ltd.\n\nIn 1924, Shorts produced the first of a series of three designs known as the '''Singapore'''. In 1927, the [[Short Singapore|Singapore I]] was made famous by Sir Alan Cobham, when he, his wife, and crew made a survey of Africa, and covered about 23,000 miles. This in itself was a trip that both proved the worth of flying boats, but also highlighted the difficulties.\n\n[[File:Short Sunderland.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Short Sunderland]], widely operated by the Allied powers during World War II]]\n\nShorts then started design work on one of its most famous designs, the [[Short S.8 Calcutta|Short Calcutta]], based on the Singapore layout but larger and more powerful,  which began service with [[Imperial Airways]] in August 1928.  By April 1929 two more had been added to the fleet, and they operated passenger-preferred coastal routes from [[Genoa]] to [[Alexandria]] by way of [[Athens]], [[Corfu]], [[Naples]], and [[Rome]]. Several Calcuttas were used on shorter routes, and were instrumental in permitting long-range airline services between outposts of the [[British Empire]]. Shorts followed the production of four Calcuttas with the larger [[Short Kent|Kent]], following with a series of still larger aircraft designs such as the [[Short Empire]], the first of which was launched on 2 July 1936. The Empire was commissioned off the drawing board by Imperial Airways (later [[BOAC]]), to operate the UK's Empire Airmail scheme. A year later Shorts won a British government defence contract for a military flying boat, the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]. Sharing the same basic design, but a modified upper structure, the Sunderland was one of the most effective long-range seaplanes in use. Dreaded by [[U-Boats]], it was nicknamed \"The Flying Porcupine\" (''Fliegendes Stachelschwein'' in German), perhaps due to its extensive armament and the several prominent dorsal antennae.\n\nIn 1933, Shorts opened a new factory at Rochester Airport, which was becoming increasingly important for the landplanes the company was producing. The Eastchurch premises was closed in 1934, and in the same year Shorts purchased the engine manufacturer [[Pobjoy]], which had moved to Rochester Airport to be near Shorts and had collaborated on its latest designs.\n\nOn 5 July 1937, a Short Empire was used by [[Imperial Airways]] for the first westbound transatlantic service from [[Foynes]], [[Ireland]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref>\n[http://iwn.iwai.ie/v28i4/flying_boats_foynes.PDF Service from Foynes, Republic of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413042855/http://iwn.iwai.ie/v28i4/flying_boats_foynes.PDF |date=13 April 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===First moves to Belfast===\nIn 1936, the [[Air Ministry]] established a new aircraft factory at [[Belfast]], and created a new company '''Short & Harland Ltd''', owned 50% each by [[Harland and Wolff]] and Shorts. The first products of the new factory were 50 [[Bristol Bombay]]s followed by 150 [[Handley-Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 28.</ref>\n\nShorts work on seaplanes eventually culminated in the [[Short Sandringham]] and [[Short Seaford]], both based on the Empire/Sunderland boats. These flying boats had enough range to operate as a transatlantic [[airliner]], but largely served the post-war Empire ([[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) market, in competition with 4-engined land planes such as modified [[Avro Lancaster]]s, [[Avro Lancastrian]] and [[Avro York]].\n\n[[Tasman Empire Airways Limited]] (TEAL) operated the ''Coral Route'' from [[New Zealand]] to [[Fiji]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tahiti]] in the South Pacific, with [[Short Solent]] flying boats up to 1960.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Short Sunderland became famous as an effective anti-submarine [[patrol bomber]], because its long range and long flying time allowed it to close the [[Mid-Atlantic gap|Mid-Atlantic air gap]] between [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]], helping end the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1940)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. It also rescued sea and air crews from the waters surrounding its spheres of operation especially those of [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]]. A squadron was ordered by the Royal Australian Air Force, but never made it to Australia; instead Australians flew for the Royal Air Force Coastal Command. Australia impressed Qantas-Imperial Empire boats into military service, and used these successfully especially on reconnaissance missions in the [[Timor Sea]] area.\n\nIt was Short's work on the Sunderland that also won it the contract for the [[Short Stirling]], the RAF's first four-engine bomber. If based on the original submission, essentially a land-based Sunderland with various cleanups, there seems to be no reason to suspect that the Stirling would not have been an excellent [[heavy bomber]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} However, the Air Ministry specification stipulated a number of other requirements of the aircraft, that it should be able to function as a troop transport for instance, and an upper limit on wingspan, that meant it was relegated as newer designs outperformed it. In 1944, the [[Short Shetland]], a high-speed, long-range, four-engined flying-boat, was built (with [[Saunders-Roe]] providing the wings and a lot of the detail design work), but the war ended before the second prototype was completed. The project continued postwar but was eventually abandoned.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Britain]], the Rochester factory was heavily bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], and several of the early-run Stirlings and other aircraft were destroyed. From then, the Belfast factory became increasingly important, because it was thought to be well beyond the range of German bombers. However, during Easter week of 1941, Belfast and the aircraft factory were subjected to the [[Belfast Blitz|worst single air-raid the UK had seen outside London]], when the defenceless city became victim of German aircraft bombing. To meet the increased requirement for its aircraft during the war, satellite factories near Belfast were operated at Aldergrove and Maghaberry, producing 232 Stirlings between them.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 388</ref> A temporary Short's factory was established at White Cross Bay, [[Windermere]],<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 368</ref> that produced 35 [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] Mark IIIs. Also during the war, [[Austin Motors]] at Longbridge, Birmingham, produced over 600 [[Short Stirling|Stirlings]], and [[Blackburn Aircraft]] produced 240 Sunderlands at its [[British shadow factories|shadow factory]] in Dumbarton, Scotland.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 541</ref>\n\nIn 1943, the Government took over the ownership and management of Short's under Defence Regulation 78: for the second time (after the nationalisation of the Airship Works at [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Cardington]] in 1919) Short Brothers was affected by nationalisation. Oswald Short, who had resigned as Chairman in January of that year, remained as Honorary Life President.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 30</ref>\n\n===Postwar===\n[[File:Short Sperrin Gyron engine.jpg|thumb|right|Short Sperrin [[de Havilland Gyron|Gyron]] test bed (lower port engine) at [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough SBAC Airshow]], September 1955]]\n[[File:C-23.jpg|thumb|US military version of the [[Shorts 330]], the company's most successful modern aircraft after the [[Shorts 360]].]]\n[[File:Short 360, Short Skyvan and Short 330 at 1982 Farnborough Airshow.jpg|thumb|A [[Short 360]], [[Short Skyvan]] and [[Short 330]] at the 1982 [[Farnborough Airshow]].]]\n[[File:ShortFJX.png|thumb|The cancelled Short FJX [[regional jet]]]]\n\nBy 1947, all of Shorts other wartime factories had been closed, and operations concentrated in Belfast. In 1948, the company offices followed, and Shorts became a Belfast company in its entirety. In the meantime, in 1947, Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. had merged with Short and Harland Limited to become '''Short Brothers and Harland Limited''', with Oswald Short remaining as Life President.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 32</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Shorts was involved in much pioneering research, including designing and building the VTOL [[Short SC.1|Short SC1]], the [[Short SB5]] and the [[Short SB.4 Sherpa]]. Shorts built the [[Short Sperrin]], a backup jet engine bomber design in case the [[V bomber]] projects failed, and the [[Short Seamew]], a cheap to produce anti-submarine reconnaissance and attack aircraft intended for the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] squadrons, but the Sperrin was not needed and the RNVR squadrons disbanded. In the 1950s, Shorts also received sub-contracts to build 150 [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and on 30 October 1952, the first of those made its maiden flight. Of these types, Shorts delivered 60 Canberra B.2s, 49 Canberra B.6s and 23 Canberra P.R.9s, the remaining 18 being cancelled by the Government in 1957.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 508</ref> Further work was involved in the conversion of time-expired Canberra B.2s into unmanned radio-controlled missile target aircraft. Two prototypes and 10 production Canberra U.10s were produced, followed by six improved Canberra U.14s. These aircraft were controlled from the ground by [[VHF]] radio, and were equipped to provide feedback on their own performance, as well as that of the missiles aimed at them.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 509</ref> As early as 1953, Shorts became involved with pioneering the development of electronic [[analogue computer]]s, to assist with the design of increasingly complex aircraft.<ref>Shorts Quarterly Review, Vol. 2 No. 3, Autumn 1953, p.1.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] became a 15.25% shareholder in Shorts, and the company used the injection of funds to set up a production line for the [[Bristol Britannia]] [[turbo-prop]] airliner, known in the press as ''The Whispering Giant''. Although it was originally intended that 35 Britannias should be built by Shorts, a shortage of work at Bristol led to this number being reduced. Eventually, 15 Britannias were completed by Shorts; five sets of Britannia components were sent to Filton and used on the continued production there of Britannias.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 510</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Shorts found a niche for a new short-haul [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] aircraft, and responded with the [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]]. The Skyvan is most remembered for its box-like, slab-sided appearance and rectangular twin tail units, but the aircraft was well loved for its performance and loading. It served almost the same performance niche as the famous [[de Havilland Twin Otter]], and the Skyvan proved more popular in the freighter market due to the large rear cargo door that allowed it to handle bulky loads with ease. Skyvans can still be found around the world today, notably in the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe heavy lift freighter [[Short Belfast|Short SC.5 Belfast]] flew for the first time in 1964. Only 10 were built for the [[Royal Air Force]]. In the 1970s, Shorts entered the [[feederliner]] market with the [[Shorts 330]], a stretched modification of the Skyvan, called the C-23 Sherpa in USAF service, and another stretch resulted in the more streamlined [[Shorts 360]], in which a more conventional central fin superseded the older H-profiled twin fins.\n\nIn 1988, the proposed development was announced of a [[regional jet]] seating 44 passengers and to be called the FJX. The aircraft would have been a competitor to the [[Bombardier CRJ200|Bombardier CRJ100]] that was also in development at the time,<ref>{{cite article |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%200560.html |title= The 50-seat jetliner |work= Flight International |date= 4 March 1989}}</ref> but the FJX was cancelled after Short Brothers' sale to Bombardier.<ref>{{cite web|last=O\u2019Keeffe|first=Niall|title=Boom and bust, the regional jet phenomenon|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-boom-and-bust-the-regional-jet-phenomenon-370541/|publisher=Flight International|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1988, [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] working at the factory attempted to sell parts, information and knowledge of a new missile system to the [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=June 2016}} This was linked to a large arms shipment in 1988 which was then divided between the [[Ulster Defence Association]], the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], and [[Ulster Resistance]].

This became Sydenham Airport and, from 1938 to 1939, was Belfast's main civilian airport. During the Second World War, the airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Navy. Shorts continued to use the airfield until production of complete aircraft ceased, despite [[Nutts Corner]], a former RAF base, becoming Belfast's main airport (Nutts Corner was itself superseded in 1963 by [[Belfast International Airport|Aldergrove]]). In 1983, following interest from airlines and customers, the airfield was opened for commercial flights as Belfast Harbour Airport (later Belfast City Airport (BCA), now [[George Best Belfast City Airport]]). Following major capital investment, Bombardier sold BCA for \u00a335 million in 2003.\n\n===Bombardier===\nIn 1977, the company changed its name back to '''Short Brothers''', and in 1984 it became a [[public limited company]] in preparation for privatisation. The government announced the sale of Shorts to [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]] on 7 June 1989 for \u00a330&nbsp;million. As part of the sale, the government also agreed to write off \u00a3390 million of the company's \"accumulated losses and inject another \u00a3390 million to recapitalise the group and cover current and future losses, capital investment and training.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n | first= Michael\n | last= Harrison\n | title= Shorts sold to Bombardier\n | work= The Independent\n | date= 1989-06-08\n}}\n</ref>\nBombardier beat a bid from The [[General Electric Company plc]] and [[Fokker]].

Shorts was founded in 1908 in [[London]], and was the first company in the world to make production aeroplanes.<ref>Barnes 1966 p. 8</ref> It was particularly notable for its [[flying boat]] designs manufactured into the 1950s.\n\nIn 1943 Shorts was [[Nationalization|nationalised]] and later denationalised, and in 1948 moved from its main base at [[Rochester, Kent]] to Belfast. In the 1960s, Shorts mainly produced [[turboprop]] airliners, major components for aerospace primary manufacturers, and [[missiles]] for the [[British Armed Forces]].\n\nIn 1989 Shorts was bought by [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]], and is today the largest manufacturing concern in Northern Ireland.<ref>[http://www.nics.gov.uk/irtu/research/engineering-4.html Shorts as a \"Centre of Excellence\" within Bombardier, 2007]</ref> Prior to that merger, the [[authorised capital]] share by the owner was: [[HM Government]], 69.5% ([[majority share]]); [[Rolls-Royce Ltd]], 15.25%; [[Harland & Wolff Ltd]], 15.25%.

They manufactured the balloons at [[Hove, Sussex]], in premises above the acoustic laboratory run by a third brother, Horace (2 July 1872 \u2013 6 April 1917). In 1903, when Horace left to work on steam turbine development with [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], Eustace and Oswald moved their workshop to rented accommodation in London, then again to railway arches in [[Battersea]], conveniently situated next to Battersea gas-works. \n\nIn 1905, they won a contract for three balloons for the [[British Indian Army]]. The quality of their work impressed Colonel [[James Templer (balloon aviator)|James Templer]], superintendent of the [[Royal Balloon Factory]], who introduced the brothers to [[Charles Rolls]]. Rolls commissioned them to build him a large balloon to compete in the 1906 [[Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)|Gordon Bennett Cup balloon race]]. More orders soon followed from other members of the [[Aero Club of Great Britain]] (later Royal Aero Club).<ref>Barnes 1967, pp. 1\u20136</ref>\n\nIn 1908, on hearing reports from Aero Club members who had seen the [[Wright brothers]]' demonstrations of their aircraft at [[Le Mans]] in France, Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace, \"This is the finish of ballooning: we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can't do that without Horace!\"<ref>Barnes 1967, p. 6</ref> Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to leave his job with Parsons, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. Two orders for aircraft were soon received, one from Charles Rolls, who ordered a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], and the other from [[Francis McClean]], a member of the Aero Club who later bought several more aircraft from Short Brothers, and also acted as an unpaid test-pilot. At the end of 1908 Horace started work on the two designs, and in early 1909 construction was started of McClean's aircraft, the [[Short No.1 biplane]]. In March 1909 it was exhibited, without its fabric covering, at the first British Aero Show held at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]]. Meanwhile, the brothers had obtained the British rights to build copies of the [[Wright Model A|Wright design]].<ref>Barnes, pp. 6\u20138</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Hibernia first ship aircraft takeoff 1912 IWM Q 71041.jpg|thumb|Commander [[Charles Rumney Samson|C.

This had been acquired by the Aero Club for use as a flying ground, together with Mussell Manor (now known as \"Muswell Manor\"), which became its clubhouse. Construction of an initial batch of six aircraft was started immediately. Short Brothers thus became the first aircraft manufacturing company in the world to undertake volume production of an aircraft design. Here the [[Dunne D.5]], the first [[tailless aircraft]], was also built under contract.  In 1910 the Royal Aero Club and Short Brothers moved to a larger and less marshy ground at [[Eastchurch airfield|Eastchurch]], about 2.5 miles (4&nbsp;km) away. At this time the Royal Aero Club had offered the Admiralty the use of the flying field and Frank McClean had agreed to act as an instructor, so beginning a close association between Short Brothers and the Naval Air Service, whose first pilots were trained using [[Short S.27]] pusher biplanes.\n\nIn 1911, Shorts built one of the world's first successful twin-engine aircraft, the [[Short S.27#Short Triple Twin|Triple Twin]]. Construction started on a long series of naval aircraft floatplanes, starting with the Short S.26.\n\nIn 1913, Gordon Bell became Shorts' first professional test pilot:  he was succeeded by Ronald Kemp in 1914. Kemp could not handle the volume of flight testing and development alone and, by 1916, other pilots were employed on a freelance basis. One of these was [[John Lankester Parker]]. In 1918 Parker succeeded Kemp as Shorts' Chief [[test pilot|Test Pilot]], a post he was to occupy for the next 27 years.<ref>Barnes 1967, pp. 8\u201312, 120</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a statue of the brothers was unveiled in memory of their contribution to early aviation, by local artist Barbara Street to stand on the site of the Aero Club clubhouse at Muswell manor. \n[[File:Short_Brothers_Statue.jpg|thumb|Short Brothers Statue at the site of their aero club (Musswell Manor, Isle of sheppy)]]\n\n=== First World War ===\n[[File:Short 184.jpg|thumb|Short 184 floatplane]]\n\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]] Shorts were already building a variety of aircraft. Production really started to expand during the war, for example for the [[Short Type 184|Short Admiralty Type 184]] (or simply \"Short S.184\"). On 15 August 1915, during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], a Short S.184 was the first aircraft to attack a ship with a live torpedo. Flying from [[HMS Ben-my-Chree|HMS ''Ben-my-Chree'']], piloted by Flight Commander [[Charles Edmonds]], it hit a [[Turkey|Turkish]] supply ship in the [[Dardanelles]].<ref>The supply ship had already been hit by a torpedo from the submarine HMS E14 4 days earlier, and had run aground. See [[Short Type 184]] for further details</ref> In terms of number built, the S.184 was Shorts' most successful pre-[[World War II|Second World War]] aircraft: over 900 were produced, many under licence by other manufacturers. A landplane version of the S.184 was also sold to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as the [[Short Bomber]].<ref>Barnes 1967, p. 113</ref>\n\nDuring the First World War, Shorts were among the manufacturers of two flying boats, the [[Felixstowe F3|F.3]] and [[Felixstowe F5|F.5]], designed by [[John Cyril Porte|John Porte]] at the [[Seaplane Experimental Station]], Felixstowe. When the war ended, some 50 of these were being built at Rochester.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 16</ref>\n\n==== Expansion at Rochester ====\nDue to the company's success, and the increasing number of seaplanes being produced, larger premises with ready access to the sea were needed. At that time, seaplanes were taken by road to Queenborough, then loaded onto [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]] to be taken to the [[Royal Naval Air Service|RNAS]] seaplane station on [[Isle of Grain]] to be launched and tested.<ref name=Hanson>Hanson, Richard.

As this and the No.2 and No.3 shops became available, the workforce moved from the Eastchurch factory. No.3 shop was completed in 1917. A long concrete [[slipway]] was constructed from the centre-line of No.3 Erecting Shop to enable aircraft of up to 20 tons weight to be launched even at low tide.<ref name=Cassidy/>\n\n====Airships at Cardington====\nIn 1916, Short Brothers was awarded a contract to build two large [[dirigible]] [[airships]] for the [[Admiralty]]. As part of the contract, a loan was provided to enable the company to purchase a site near [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]], on which to build airship construction facilities. As a result, the company concentrated on the construction of heavier-than-air aeroplanes in the Isle of Sheppey/Rochester area, and balloons and dirigibles at Cardington. A housing estate built by the company near Cardington to house its employees still bears the name [[Shortstown]].<ref>Barnes & James 1989, p. 15</ref>\n\nIn 1919, the name of the company was changed to Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd., but nationalisation the same year ended the Short brothers' involvement with the company, which became the [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Royal Airship Works]].\n\n===The 1920s and 1930s===\nDuring the immediate post-war years the economic climate was difficult for the aircraft industry in the United Kingdom. Shorts survived without reducing the company's workforce by diversifying into areas such as building lightweight bus and tram bodies.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 19.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, [[flying boats]] were favoured for long-range civil aviation, because their operation did not rely on the existence of suitable airfields, which were not widespread at the time. Shorts took to the flying boat market, and in 1924 constructed a {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} testing tank for testing hull and float designs. Shorts designed the floats used for the [[Supermarine S.4]] and [[Gloster III]] seaplanes entered by the United Kingdom for the 1925 [[Schneider Trophy]] race. [[Alan Cobham]]'s [[de Havilland DH.50]] (G-EBFO) was also fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester. On 30 June 1926, Cobham then started a flight to Australia from the Medway. Two [[de Havilland Giant Moth]]s were fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester, and the first was flown in June 1928; both were delivered to Western Canada Airlines Ltd.\n\nIn 1924, Shorts produced the first of a series of three designs known as the '''Singapore'''. In 1927, the [[Short Singapore|Singapore I]] was made famous by Sir Alan Cobham, when he, his wife, and crew made a survey of Africa, and covered about 23,000 miles. This in itself was a trip that both proved the worth of flying boats, but also highlighted the difficulties.\n\n[[File:Short Sunderland.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Short Sunderland]], widely operated by the Allied powers during World War II]]\n\nShorts then started design work on one of its most famous designs, the [[Short S.8 Calcutta|Short Calcutta]], based on the Singapore layout but larger and more powerful,  which began service with [[Imperial Airways]] in August 1928.  By April 1929 two more had been added to the fleet, and they operated passenger-preferred coastal routes from [[Genoa]] to [[Alexandria]] by way of [[Athens]], [[Corfu]], [[Naples]], and [[Rome]]. Several Calcuttas were used on shorter routes, and were instrumental in permitting long-range airline services between outposts of the [[British Empire]]. Shorts followed the production of four Calcuttas with the larger [[Short Kent|Kent]], following with a series of still larger aircraft designs such as the [[Short Empire]], the first of which was launched on 2 July 1936. The Empire was commissioned off the drawing board by Imperial Airways (later [[BOAC]]), to operate the UK's Empire Airmail scheme. A year later Shorts won a British government defence contract for a military flying boat, the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]. Sharing the same basic design, but a modified upper structure, the Sunderland was one of the most effective long-range seaplanes in use. Dreaded by [[U-Boats]], it was nicknamed \"The Flying Porcupine\" (''Fliegendes Stachelschwein'' in German), perhaps due to its extensive armament and the several prominent dorsal antennae.\n\nIn 1933, Shorts opened a new factory at Rochester Airport, which was becoming increasingly important for the landplanes the company was producing. The Eastchurch premises was closed in 1934, and in the same year Shorts purchased the engine manufacturer [[Pobjoy]], which had moved to Rochester Airport to be near Shorts and had collaborated on its latest designs.\n\nOn 5 July 1937, a Short Empire was used by [[Imperial Airways]] for the first westbound transatlantic service from [[Foynes]], [[Ireland]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref>\n[http://iwn.iwai.ie/v28i4/flying_boats_foynes.PDF Service from Foynes, Republic of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413042855/http://iwn.iwai.ie/v28i4/flying_boats_foynes.PDF |date=13 April 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===First moves to Belfast===\nIn 1936, the [[Air Ministry]] established a new aircraft factory at [[Belfast]], and created a new company '''Short & Harland Ltd''', owned 50% each by [[Harland and Wolff]] and Shorts. The first products of the new factory were 50 [[Bristol Bombay]]s followed by 150 [[Handley-Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 28.</ref>\n\nShorts work on seaplanes eventually culminated in the [[Short Sandringham]] and [[Short Seaford]], both based on the Empire/Sunderland boats. These flying boats had enough range to operate as a transatlantic [[airliner]], but largely served the post-war Empire ([[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) market, in competition with 4-engined land planes such as modified [[Avro Lancaster]]s, [[Avro Lancastrian]] and [[Avro York]].\n\n[[Tasman Empire Airways Limited]] (TEAL) operated the ''Coral Route'' from [[New Zealand]] to [[Fiji]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tahiti]] in the South Pacific, with [[Short Solent]] flying boats up to 1960.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Short Sunderland became famous as an effective anti-submarine [[patrol bomber]], because its long range and long flying time allowed it to close the [[Mid-Atlantic gap|Mid-Atlantic air gap]] between [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]], helping end the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1940)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. It also rescued sea and air crews from the waters surrounding its spheres of operation especially those of [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]]. A squadron was ordered by the Royal Australian Air Force, but never made it to Australia; instead Australians flew for the Royal Air Force Coastal Command. Australia impressed Qantas-Imperial Empire boats into military service, and used these successfully especially on reconnaissance missions in the [[Timor Sea]] area.\n\nIt was Short's work on the Sunderland that also won it the contract for the [[Short Stirling]], the RAF's first four-engine bomber. If based on the original submission, essentially a land-based Sunderland with various cleanups, there seems to be no reason to suspect that the Stirling would not have been an excellent [[heavy bomber]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} However, the Air Ministry specification stipulated a number of other requirements of the aircraft, that it should be able to function as a troop transport for instance, and an upper limit on wingspan, that meant it was relegated as newer designs outperformed it. In 1944, the [[Short Shetland]], a high-speed, long-range, four-engined flying-boat, was built (with [[Saunders-Roe]] providing the wings and a lot of the detail design work), but the war ended before the second prototype was completed. The project continued postwar but was eventually abandoned.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Britain]], the Rochester factory was heavily bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], and several of the early-run Stirlings and other aircraft were destroyed. From then, the Belfast factory became increasingly important, because it was thought to be well beyond the range of German bombers. However, during Easter week of 1941, Belfast and the aircraft factory were subjected to the [[Belfast Blitz|worst single air-raid the UK had seen outside London]], when the defenceless city became victim of German aircraft bombing. To meet the increased requirement for its aircraft during the war, satellite factories near Belfast were operated at Aldergrove and Maghaberry, producing 232 Stirlings between them.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 388</ref> A temporary Short's factory was established at White Cross Bay, [[Windermere]],<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 368</ref> that produced 35 [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] Mark IIIs. Also during the war, [[Austin Motors]] at Longbridge, Birmingham, produced over 600 [[Short Stirling|Stirlings]], and [[Blackburn Aircraft]] produced 240 Sunderlands at its [[British shadow factories|shadow factory]] in Dumbarton, Scotland.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 541</ref>\n\nIn 1943, the Government took over the ownership and management of Short's under Defence Regulation 78: for the second time (after the nationalisation of the Airship Works at [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Cardington]] in 1919) Short Brothers was affected by nationalisation. Oswald Short, who had resigned as Chairman in January of that year, remained as Honorary Life President.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 30</ref>\n\n===Postwar===\n[[File:Short Sperrin Gyron engine.jpg|thumb|right|Short Sperrin [[de Havilland Gyron|Gyron]] test bed (lower port engine) at [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough SBAC Airshow]], September 1955]]\n[[File:C-23.jpg|thumb|US military version of the [[Shorts 330]], the company's most successful modern aircraft after the [[Shorts 360]].]]\n[[File:Short 360, Short Skyvan and Short 330 at 1982 Farnborough Airshow.jpg|thumb|A [[Short 360]], [[Short Skyvan]] and [[Short 330]] at the 1982 [[Farnborough Airshow]].]]\n[[File:ShortFJX.png|thumb|The cancelled Short FJX [[regional jet]]]]\n\nBy 1947, all of Shorts other wartime factories had been closed, and operations concentrated in Belfast. In 1948, the company offices followed, and Shorts became a Belfast company in its entirety. In the meantime, in 1947, Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. had merged with Short and Harland Limited to become '''Short Brothers and Harland Limited''', with Oswald Short remaining as Life President.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 32</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, Shorts was involved in much pioneering research, including designing and building the VTOL [[Short SC.1|Short SC1]], the [[Short SB5]] and the [[Short SB.4 Sherpa]]. Shorts built the [[Short Sperrin]], a backup jet engine bomber design in case the [[V bomber]] projects failed, and the [[Short Seamew]], a cheap to produce anti-submarine reconnaissance and attack aircraft intended for the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] squadrons, but the Sperrin was not needed and the RNVR squadrons disbanded. In the 1950s, Shorts also received sub-contracts to build 150 [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and on 30 October 1952, the first of those made its maiden flight. Of these types, Shorts delivered 60 Canberra B.2s, 49 Canberra B.6s and 23 Canberra P.R.9s, the remaining 18 being cancelled by the Government in 1957.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 508</ref> Further work was involved in the conversion of time-expired Canberra B.2s into unmanned radio-controlled missile target aircraft. Two prototypes and 10 production Canberra U.10s were produced, followed by six improved Canberra U.14s. These aircraft were controlled from the ground by [[VHF]] radio, and were equipped to provide feedback on their own performance, as well as that of the missiles aimed at them.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 509</ref> As early as 1953, Shorts became involved with pioneering the development of electronic [[analogue computer]]s, to assist with the design of increasingly complex aircraft.<ref>Shorts Quarterly Review, Vol. 2 No. 3, Autumn 1953, p.1.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] became a 15.25% shareholder in Shorts, and the company used the injection of funds to set up a production line for the [[Bristol Britannia]] [[turbo-prop]] airliner, known in the press as ''The Whispering Giant''. Although it was originally intended that 35 Britannias should be built by Shorts, a shortage of work at Bristol led to this number being reduced. Eventually, 15 Britannias were completed by Shorts; five sets of Britannia components were sent to Filton and used on the continued production there of Britannias.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p. 510</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Shorts found a niche for a new short-haul [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] aircraft, and responded with the [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]]. The Skyvan is most remembered for its box-like, slab-sided appearance and rectangular twin tail units, but the aircraft was well loved for its performance and loading. It served almost the same performance niche as the famous [[de Havilland Twin Otter]], and the Skyvan proved more popular in the freighter market due to the large rear cargo door that allowed it to handle bulky loads with ease. Skyvans can still be found around the world today, notably in the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe heavy lift freighter [[Short Belfast|Short SC.5 Belfast]] flew for the first time in 1964. Only 10 were built for the [[Royal Air Force]]. In the 1970s, Shorts entered the [[feederliner]] market with the [[Shorts 330]], a stretched modification of the Skyvan, called the C-23 Sherpa in USAF service, and another stretch resulted in the more streamlined [[Shorts 360]], in which a more conventional central fin superseded the older H-profiled twin fins.\n\nIn 1988, the proposed development was announced of a [[regional jet]] seating 44 passengers and to be called the FJX. The aircraft would have been a competitor to the [[Bombardier CRJ200|Bombardier CRJ100]] that was also in development at the time,<ref>{{cite article |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%200560.html |title= The 50-seat jetliner |work= Flight International |date= 4 March 1989}}</ref> but the FJX was cancelled after Short Brothers' sale to Bombardier.<ref>{{cite web|last=O\u2019Keeffe|first=Niall|title=Boom and bust, the regional jet phenomenon|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-boom-and-bust-the-regional-jet-phenomenon-370541/|publisher=Flight International|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1988, [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] working at the factory attempted to sell parts, information and knowledge of a new missile system to the [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=June 2016}} This was linked to a large arms shipment in 1988 which was then divided between the [[Ulster Defence Association]], the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], and [[Ulster Resistance]]. In April 1989, three Northern Irish men, Noel Lyttle, Samuel Quinn and James King, were arrested in Paris. Also arrested were arms dealer [[Douglas Bernhardt]] and a South African diplomat, [[Daniel Storm]].<ref>\n[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0122/S.0122.198905100013.html Seanad \u00c9ireann - Volume 122 - 10 May 1989] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224095544/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0122/S.0122.198905100013.html |date=24 December 2005 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Belfast City Airport===\nIn 1937, Shorts established an airfield in central Belfast, beside the factory. This became Sydenham Airport and, from 1938 to 1939, was Belfast's main civilian airport. During the Second World War, the airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Navy. Shorts continued to use the airfield until production of complete aircraft ceased, despite [[Nutts Corner]], a former RAF base, becoming Belfast's main airport (Nutts Corner was itself superseded in 1963 by [[Belfast International Airport|Aldergrove]]). In 1983, following interest from airlines and customers, the airfield was opened for commercial flights as Belfast Harbour Airport (later Belfast City Airport (BCA), now [[George Best Belfast City Airport]]). Following major capital investment, Bombardier sold BCA for \u00a335 million in 2003.\n\n===Bombardier===\nIn 1977, the company changed its name back to '''Short Brothers''', and in 1984 it became a [[public limited company]] in preparation for privatisation. The government announced the sale of Shorts to [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]] on 7 June 1989 for \u00a330&nbsp;million. As part of the sale, the government also agreed to write off \u00a3390 million of the company's \"accumulated losses and inject another \u00a3390 million to recapitalise the group and cover current and future losses, capital investment and training.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n | first= Michael\n | last= Harrison\n | title= Shorts sold to Bombardier\n | work= The Independent\n | date= 1989-06-08\n}}\n</ref>\nBombardier beat a bid from The [[General Electric Company plc]] and [[Fokker]].

In 2000, Thomson-CSF bought Bombardier's 50% share to become the sole owner of Shorts Missile Systems, renaming it [[Thales Air Defence Limited]] in 2001.\n\n===Spirit AeroSystems===\nOn 31 October 2019, Bombardier announced the sale of its aerostructures activities to [[Spirit AeroSystems]]. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2020 subject to regulatory approval.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Bombardier Announces Definitive Agreement to Sell Aerostructures Business to Spirit AeroSystems Holding, Inc. - Bombardier |url=https://www.bombardier.com/en/media/newsList/details.binc-20191031-bombardier-announces-definitive-agreement-to-sell-.bombardiercom.html |website=www.bombardier.com |language=en |date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=John |title=Bombardier NI operations sold to US firm |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50246299 |work=BBC News |date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shorts apprenticeship system===\nShort Brothers has a decades long engineering apprenticeship systems which has trained many skilled tradesmen, engineering technicians, technical engineers and Chartered Engineers.

(1899\u20131962)", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n[[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City Football Club]] is a professional [[association football]] team based in [[Cardiff]], Wales. The '''history of Cardiff City F.C. from 1899 to 1962''' covers the club's founding, its move into the [[Southern Football League]] and its election to the [[English Football League|Football League]] to the end of the [[1961\u201362 Cardiff City F.C. season|1961\u201362 season]]. \n\nFounded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C., the club was renamed Cardiff City in 1908 and joined the Southern Football League two years later. The side was elected into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] of the Football League in 1920, winning promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in its first season. The team finished as runners-up in the [[1923\u201324 in English football|1923\u201324 season]], missing out on the title by the closest margin in First Division history. They reached their first [[FA Cup]] final the following year before becoming the only non-English team to win the trophy in the [[1927 FA Cup Final|1927 final]] when they defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20130 after a goal from [[Hughie Ferguson]].\n\nSoon after its cup triumph, the club entered a decline that saw the side relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] by 1932. Financial problems coincided with their descent and the team finished bottom of the Football League at the end of the [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334 season]] and were forced to apply for re-election. After the Second World War, the club enjoyed a resurgence and won the Third Division South title in the first season after the conflict. The team returned to the First Division soon after and spent most of the 1950s in the top tier of English football.\n\n==Early years (1899\u20131910)==\nIn 1899, [[Bristol]]-born lithographic artist [[Bartley Wilson]] began searching for a way of keeping players from the Riverside Cricket Club, where he was a member, together and in shape during the winter months when the cricket season had ended.<ref name=\"foundations\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cardiffcityfc.co.uk/news/2013/march/1899-1920-foundations--the-early-years/ |title=1899\u20131920 Foundations & The Early Years |publisher=Cardiff City F.C. |last=Shepherd |first=Richard |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> Wilson, who had moved to Cardiff in 1895 to work for the Imperial Printing Company, organised a meeting at his home near [[Cardiff Castle]] in the autumn of 1899.<ref name=\"Grandin11\" >{{harvnb|Grandin|2010|p=11}}</ref> The first meeting was met with a lukewarm reception but Wilson was undeterred and a second, more widely attended meeting, resulted in the founding of Riverside A.F.C.

The team played their first fixture against Barry West End on 7 October 1899, suffering a 9\u20131 defeat.<ref name=\"Lloyd17\"/> Undeterred, they played several other friendlies before joining the Cardiff & District League for their first competitive season in 1900.\nImprovements made to Sophia Gardens, including the installation of gas and water resulted in increased memberships and the club merged with nearby Riverside Albion in 1902. It took a further three years until the club won its first trophy, the Bevan Shield, a local competition organised by the [[South Wales and Monmouthshire Football Association]] (SWMFA).<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|p=24}}</ref> Cardiff was granted city status by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] in 1905 and as a result the club put in a request to change its name to Cardiff City. The request was turned down as they were deemed to be not playing at a high enough level. To combat this, they arranged to join the South Wales Amateur League in 1907 and the following year they were granted permission to change the name of the club to Cardiff City.<ref name=\"foundations\"/><ref name=\"Grandin11\"/> The club received permission from the SWMFA on the stipulation that should a professional team be founded in the city, they would relinquish the name.<ref name=\"Lloyd27\">{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|p=27}}</ref>\n\nInterest in the game in South Wales began to rise during this time and officials from the [[Southern Football League]], who were looking to expand and start a Second Division, toured the area looking for potential entrants. [[Ton Pentre F.C.|Ton Pentre]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare]] were all accepted into the new division but Cardiff were denied the opportunity due to the poor standard of facilities at their Sophia Gardens ground,<ref name=\"RD\">{{cite book |title=Red Dragons \u2013 The Story of Welsh Football |author=Phil Stead |publisher=Y Llofa |year=2013 |location=Ceredigion |isbn=9781847714688}}</ref> including the lack of turnstiles and inadequate conditions for spectators. In the hope of raising funds and gauging public support, the club's committee were able to arrange a friendly match against Southern League First Division side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in October 1909, held at the nearby [[Cardiff Arms Park]] home of local rugby team [[Cardiff RFC]].<ref name=\"Grandin12\">{{harvnb|Grandin|2010|p=12}}</ref> The match ended in a 3\u20133 draw and yielded gate receipts of \u00a333 for the club. A second friendly was hastily arranged for the following month, with [[Football League First Division]] side [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] the opponents. However, despite increased takings of \u00a350, Bristol's appearance fee severely depleted profits and the match ended in a disheartening 7\u20131 defeat. The committee pushed forward with a third friendly with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], also of the Football League First Division, chosen as opponents. The match was held at Harlequins Ground, part of [[Cardiff High School]], with Cardiff defeatimg a Middlesbrough side that featured several [[England national football team|England international]] players 2\u20131 and netted the club a \u00a339 profit.<ref name=\"foundations\"/><ref name=\"Grandin12\"/>\n\nEncouraged by the response generated by the fixtures, Wilson and the club's committee opened talks with the Bute Estate, one of the major landowners in the city, in the hope of finding a suitable site for the construction of a new ground.<ref name=\"Grandin12\"/> They were offered a former rubbish tip, located between a railway station and Sloper Road on an initial seven-year lease for an annual rent of \u00a390.<ref name=\"Hayes7\">{{harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=7}}</ref> With the assistance of local volunteers and workers of the [[Cardiff County Borough Council|Cardiff Corporation]], the site was cleared and levelled and a single wooden stand was erected. When one of the club's guarantors pulled out of the deal [[Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart]], son of [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute]], stepped in to cover the shortfall. In appreciation, the new ground was named [[Ninian Park]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/8007646.stm |title=Farewell Ninian Park |publisher=BBC Sport |last=Shuttleworth |first=Peter |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> The other four guarantors for the site were [[D.

A board of directors was also elected to professionalise the club, with [[Sydney Nicholls]] named as the organisation's first chairman and Wilson continuing in his role as club secretary.<ref name=\"foundations\"/> The club also made its first professional signing the following year with the acquisition of [[Forward (association football)|outside-forward]] [[Jack Evans (Welsh footballer)|Jack Evans]] from fellow Welsh side Cwmparc, with Evans receiving a signing on fee of six [[shilling]]s to cover his travel expenses.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gallery/cardiff-citys-record-signings-4891327 |title=Cardiff City's record signings |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |last=Doel |first=Jon |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe club soon decided on the need to appoint a manager and Wilson was quick to hire the first in the club's history in [[Davy McDougall]], who became [[player-manager]] and [[Captain (association football)|captain]].

Watts-Jones remained in charge for another three years and led an overhaul of the playing squad until he was replaced by [[Billy Jennings (Welsh footballer)|Bill Jennings]], a former Welsh international who had been brought to the club originally as trainer four years previously.<ref name=\"lloyd124\">{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1937, the Grandstand at Ninian Park was destroyed by fire after thieves broke in an attempt to steal gate receipts from a recent FA Cup fixture against [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].<ref name=\"lloyd124\"/> Under Jennings, there were signs that the worst was over both on and off the field. The teams' results began to improve over the next two seasons, and in turn; this meant that more fans were coming to Ninian Park to see their team's revival. Industrialist [[Herbert Merrett]] took an interest in the club and over a year, acquired control of the club and wiped out its longstanding debts.<ref name=\"lloyd124l8\">{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|p=128}}</ref> The 1938\u201339 season saw the debut of a midfielder who would be a prominent member of future City sides; [[Billy Baker (footballer, born 1920)|Billy Baker]], however a final league position of 13th in the division led new chairman Herbert Merrett to appoint [[Cyril Spiers]] as secretary-manager to replace Jennings for the 1939\u201340 season. However, the Football League season was abandoned after the opening three matches following the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"lloyd129\">{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|p=129}}</ref>\n\n==Wartime and revival (1939\u201362)==\n\nSpiers instead decided to use the time to develop the club's youth structure, setting up a nursery side nearby to attract the most talented local youngsters.<ref name=\"lloyd129\"/> Numerous players at the club served during the conflict although reserve team goalkeeper Jackie Pritchard was the only player who perished. Some players, such as [[Billy James (Welsh footballer)|Billy James]], found that the war left them unable to return to professional football.<ref name=\"glr\"/> Several players who had trained in the club's feeder teams during the war went on to form the backbone of the first team on the resumption of the Football League for the [[1946\u201347 in English football|1946\u201347 season]]. However, Spiers was not around to take part in their success having resigned from his position over a contractual dispute with the board. He had agreed to take a paycut during the war but walked out after the board refused to restore his original contract at the end of hostilities. [[Billy McCandless]] was appointed in his stead and, despite suffering defeat against Spiers' new side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in their opening game,<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|pp=134\u2013135}}</ref> they were crowned as champions of Third Division South after finishing nine points clear of their nearest rivals. Forward [[Stan Richards (footballer)|Stan Richards]] scored 30 league goals during the campaign, setting a new club record that stood until 2003.<ref name=\"glr\"/> Despite his success, McCandless decided to accept an offer from local rivals [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] and left his position. In response, Spiers settled his argument with the board and return to the club for a second spell.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|p=140}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, Cardiff achieved promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1929 after finishing second, overtaking Birmingham City on the final day of the season.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|pp=146}}</ref> Spiers would depart the club a second time in 1954, having believed to have fallen out with chairman Herbert Merrett again over the signing of [[Trevor Ford]]. Spiers had pushed for Ford's arrival, which was eventually granted, although Merrett resented the \u00a330,000 transfer fee which he claimed \"reduced the club's working profit by half\".<ref name=\"lloyd148\">{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref> Later the same year, Bartley Wilson who had served the club in some capacity since he helped found it over 50 years previously retired and died six months later.<ref name=\"lloyd148\"/>\n\nFollowing the return of the Football League Cardiff chairman Sir Herbert Merrett established close links with [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] after being a regular visitor to a hotel owned by the Torquay chairman. The arrangement saw any players Cardiff thought not good enough would be offered to Torquay and Cardiff would get first refusal on any players who were thought good enough to make it in higher leagues. A number of players joined Cardiff from Torquay, the most successful being goalkeeper [[Phil Joslin (footballer)|Phil Joslin]], winger [[Mike Tiddy]] and forward [[Tommy Northcott]]. However the relationship became sour after Cardiff allowed Harry Parfitt to join the [[Devon]] based side in the understanding they could have him back when required. In 1954 Cardiff offered \u00a32500 to bring him back but Torquay demanded \u00a35000. Despite the Torquay chairman willing to let him return to Cardiff for \u00a32500 several members of the club's board decided to block the move until a higher price was agreed. Cardiff eventually paid the \u00a35000 asking price but subsequently broke off ties with Torquay.<ref name=ccfcmisc>{{Cite book | title = The Cardiff City Miscellany | first = Richard | last = Shepherd | publisher = Pitch books | year = 2007 | isbn= 1-905411-04-9}}</ref>\n\nSpiers' replacement was his assistant [[Trevor Morris (footballer)|Trevor Morris]], a former player whose career had been ended by a broken leg in a wartime fixture for Cardiff.<ref name=\"lloyd148\"/> Under Morris, the team dropped into the lower half of the table in consecutive seasons before, in the [[1956\u201357 in English football|1956\u201357]] season, they were relegated to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardiff City Dropped Into Second Division|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iFZjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GW8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4670%2C4111394|date=29 April 1957|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=The StarPhoenix|location=Saskatoon}}</ref> After a disappointing season in the second tier, finishing 15th, Morris left the club.

The population was 8,891 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe land area that became Carbondale was developed by William and Maurice Wurts, the founders of the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal Company]], during the rise of the [[anthracite coal]] mining industry<ref name=EB1911/> in the early 19th century. Carbondale was the site of the first deep vein anthracite coal mine<ref>[https://www.pinterest.com/pin/20969954490655264/ Tablet Marking The Site of The First Underground Coal Mine in Carbondale]</ref> in the United States. It was also a major terminal of the [[Delaware and Hudson Railroad]].\n\nLike many other cities and towns in the region, Carbondale has struggled with the demise of the once-prominent coal mining industry that had once made the region a haven for immigrants seeking work so many decades ago.

When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from [[San Francisco Bay]] through [[Monterey Bay]] to the lower [[Salinas Valley]]. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The [[Ohlone languages]] make up a sub-family of the [[Utian languages|Utian language]] family.<ref>Callaghan 1997</ref> Older proposals place Utian within the [[Penutian language|Penutian]] language phylum, while newer proposals group it as [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]].\n\nBritish ethnologist [[Robert Gordon Latham]] originally used the term \"Costanoan\" to refer to the linguistically similar but ethnically diverse Native American tribes in the San Francisco Bay Area.<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Languages of Northern, Western and Central America |author=Latham, R.

They lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical ethnographic California pattern. The members of these various bands interacted freely with one another.

The Spanish constructed [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] along the California coast with the objective of Christianizing the native people and culture. Between the years 1769 and 1834, the number of Indigenous Californians dropped from 300,000 to 250,000. After California entered into the Union in 1850, the state government perpetrated massacres against the Ohlone people.

The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried [[Rumsen tribe|Rumsen]] Costanoan and [[Esselen]] speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are descendants of [[Mutsun tribe|Mutsun]] Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California. These groups, and others with smaller memberships (see groups listed under the heading ''Present Day'' below) are separately petitioning the federal government for [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal recognition]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Choris Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone people painted by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===\nThe Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like [[acorn]]s and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict. Cultural arts included [[basket-weaving]] skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female [[tattoo]]s, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.<ref>For habitation region, Kroeber, 1925:462.

In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built [[Balsa (ship)|boats]] of [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule]] to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.<ref>Tule rush houses, redwood houses and sweat lodges, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, [[tule]] skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes. Both wore ornamentation of necklaces, shell beads and abalone pendants, and bone wood earrings with shells and beads. The ornamentation often indicated status within their community.<ref>Clothing and ornamentation, Teixeira, 1997:2.</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nA full list of their [[ethnobotany]] can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/50/ (430 documented plant uses) and http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/51/ (6 documented plant uses).[[File:Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone dancers drawn by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]]]]\n\n===Kuksu Religion===\n\nResearchers are sensitive to limitations in historical knowledge, and careful not to place the spiritual and religious beliefs of all Ohlone people into a single unified worldview.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scolari|first=P.|title=Photographs Link Ohlone Past and Present|journal=News from Native California|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Due to the displacement of Indian people in the Missions between 1769\u20131833, cultural groups are working as ethnographers to discover for themselves their ancestral history, and what that information tells about them as a cultural group.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472. Observation that Kuksu may have been learned at missions, Kroeber, 1925:470. Kuksu description and ceremony types, Kroeber, 1907b, online as ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ric The Religion of the Indians of California]''; See also: ''[http://www.maidu.com/maidu/maiduculture/kuksu.html The Kuksu Cult - paraphrased from Kroeber]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094423/http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ric |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nKuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the [[Miwok]] and [[Esselen]], also [[Maidu]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]], and northernmost [[Yokuts]]. However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing.

Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions.

Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural spiritual and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[Donation|donations]]) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

Note the number of 26,000 includes Salinans</ref> Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire [[population of Native California]]. However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\". Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label [[Utian languages|Utian]]. The controversial [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]] language family.<ref>Utian and Penutian classification: Levy, 1978:485\u2013486 (citing Kroeber), Callaghan 1997, Golla 2007. Yok-Utian as a taxonomic category: Callaghan 1997, 2001; Golla 2007:76.</ref>\n\nEight dialects or languages of Ohlone have been recorded: [[Awaswas language|Awaswas]], [[Chalon language|Chalon]], [[Chochenyo language|Chochenyo]] (aka Choche\u00f1o), [[Karkin language|Karkin]], [[Mutsun language|Mutsun]], [[Ramaytush language|Ramaytush]], [[Rumsen language|Rumsen]], and [[Tamyen language|Tamyen]].\n\n==Salvaging records==\nThe [[chroniclers]], [[ethnohistorian]]s, and [[ethnolinguist|linguist]]s of the Ohlone population began with: [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979). Quotes Harrington's \"cornering research\" and \"Harrington&nbsp;... would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in'\" said by Heizer 1975, in Bean:xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref>\n\nRecent Ohlone historians that have published new research are Lauren Teixeira, Randall Milliken and Lowell J.

When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from [[San Francisco Bay]] through [[Monterey Bay]] to the lower [[Salinas Valley]]. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The [[Ohlone languages]] make up a sub-family of the [[Utian languages|Utian language]] family.<ref>Callaghan 1997</ref> Older proposals place Utian within the [[Penutian language|Penutian]] language phylum, while newer proposals group it as [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]].\n\nBritish ethnologist [[Robert Gordon Latham]] originally used the term \"Costanoan\" to refer to the linguistically similar but ethnically diverse Native American tribes in the San Francisco Bay Area.<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Languages of Northern, Western and Central America |author=Latham, R.

They lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical ethnographic California pattern. The members of these various bands interacted freely with one another.

The Spanish constructed [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] along the California coast with the objective of Christianizing the native people and culture. Between the years 1769 and 1834, the number of Indigenous Californians dropped from 300,000 to 250,000. After California entered into the Union in 1850, the state government perpetrated massacres against the Ohlone people.

The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried [[Rumsen tribe|Rumsen]] Costanoan and [[Esselen]] speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are descendants of [[Mutsun tribe|Mutsun]] Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California. These groups, and others with smaller memberships (see groups listed under the heading ''Present Day'' below) are separately petitioning the federal government for [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal recognition]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Choris Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone people painted by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===\nThe Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like [[acorn]]s and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict. Cultural arts included [[basket-weaving]] skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female [[tattoo]]s, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.<ref>For habitation region, Kroeber, 1925:462.

These food sources were abundant in earlier times and maintained by careful work, and through active management of all the natural resources at hand.<ref>Controlled burning as harvesting, Brown 1973:3,4,25; Levy 1978:491; Stanger, 1969:94; Bean and Lawton, 1973:11,30,39 (Lewis).

Waterfowl were the most important birds in the people's diet, which were captured with nets and decoys. The Chochenyo traditional narratives refer to ducks as food, and [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]] observed in his journal that geese were stuffed and dried \"to use as decoys in hunting others\".<ref>All the animals, except waterfowl and quail, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In fact, there were so many sea lions that according to Crespi it \"looked like a pavement\" to the incoming Spanish.<ref>Quotation from Crespi, \"sea lion pavement\" Teixeira, 1997:2.</ref>\n\nIn general, along the bayshore and valleys, the Ohlone constructed dome-shaped houses of woven or bundled mats of tules, 6 to 20 feet (1.8 to 6 m) in diameter. In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built [[Balsa (ship)|boats]] of [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule]] to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.<ref>Tule rush houses, redwood houses and sweat lodges, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, [[tule]] skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes. Both wore ornamentation of necklaces, shell beads and abalone pendants, and bone wood earrings with shells and beads. The ornamentation often indicated status within their community.<ref>Clothing and ornamentation, Teixeira, 1997:2.</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nA full list of their [[ethnobotany]] can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/50/ (430 documented plant uses) and http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/51/ (6 documented plant uses).[[File:Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone dancers drawn by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]]]]\n\n===Kuksu Religion===\n\nResearchers are sensitive to limitations in historical knowledge, and careful not to place the spiritual and religious beliefs of all Ohlone people into a single unified worldview.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scolari|first=P.|title=Photographs Link Ohlone Past and Present|journal=News from Native California|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Due to the displacement of Indian people in the Missions between 1769\u20131833, cultural groups are working as ethnographers to discover for themselves their ancestral history, and what that information tells about them as a cultural group.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472. Observation that Kuksu may have been learned at missions, Kroeber, 1925:470. Kuksu description and ceremony types, Kroeber, 1907b, online as ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ric The Religion of the Indians of California]''; See also: ''[http://www.maidu.com/maidu/maiduculture/kuksu.html The Kuksu Cult - paraphrased from Kroeber]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094423/http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/ric |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nKuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the [[Miwok]] and [[Esselen]], also [[Maidu]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]], and northernmost [[Yokuts]]. However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions. Indian Canyon is also home to many Ohlone people, specifically of the Mutsun band, and serves as an educational, cultural, and spiritual environment for all visitors. Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural spiritual and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

In terms of our time-counting system, the first or 'Early Horizon' extends from about 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE in the Bay Area and to about 2000 BCE in the Central Valley. The second or Middle Horizon was from these dates to 700 CE, while the third or Late Horizon, was from 700 CE to the coming of the Spaniards in the 1770s.\"<ref>F.M.

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development. Ohlone feel that the public land should remain undisturbed.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[Donation|donations]]) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

Note the number of 26,000 includes Salinans</ref> Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire [[population of Native California]]. However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\". Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label [[Utian languages|Utian]]. The controversial [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]] language family.<ref>Utian and Penutian classification: Levy, 1978:485\u2013486 (citing Kroeber), Callaghan 1997, Golla 2007. Yok-Utian as a taxonomic category: Callaghan 1997, 2001; Golla 2007:76.</ref>\n\nEight dialects or languages of Ohlone have been recorded: [[Awaswas language|Awaswas]], [[Chalon language|Chalon]], [[Chochenyo language|Chochenyo]] (aka Choche\u00f1o), [[Karkin language|Karkin]], [[Mutsun language|Mutsun]], [[Ramaytush language|Ramaytush]], [[Rumsen language|Rumsen]], and [[Tamyen language|Tamyen]].\n\n==Salvaging records==\nThe [[chroniclers]], [[ethnohistorian]]s, and [[ethnolinguist|linguist]]s of the Ohlone population began with: [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979). Quotes Harrington's \"cornering research\" and \"Harrington&nbsp;... would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in'\" said by Heizer 1975, in Bean:xxiii\u2013xxiv.</ref>\n\nRecent Ohlone historians that have published new research are Lauren Teixeira, Randall Milliken and Lowell J.
