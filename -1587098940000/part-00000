Gaining consensus on essential data content and documentation standards is a necessary prerequisite for high-quality data in the interconnected healthcare system of the future. Continuous quality management of data standards and content is key to ensuring that information is usable and actionable.<ref>Mervat Abdelhak et al.: \u201cHealth Information: Management of a Strategic Resource\u201d, Second Edition</ref>\n\n===Records===\n*The '''patient health record''' is the primary legal record documenting the health care services provided to a person in any aspect of the health care system. The term includes routine clinical or office records, records of care in any health related setting, preventive care, lifestyle evaluation, research protocols and various clinical databases. This repository of information about a single patient is generated by health care professionals as a direct result of interaction with a patient or with individuals who have personal knowledge of the patient.\n*The '''primary patient record''' is the record that is used by health care professionals while providing patient care services to review patient data or document their own observations, actions, or instructions.\n*The '''secondary patient record''' is a record that is derived from the primary record and contains selected data elements to aid non clinical persons in supporting, evaluating and advancing patient care.  Patient care support refers to administration, regulation, and payment functions.\n\n===Practices===\n\n====Methods to ensure Data Quality====\nThe accuracy of data depends on the manual or computer information system design for collecting, recording, storing, processing, accessing and displaying data as well as the ability and follow- through of the people involved in each phase of these activities. Everyone involved with documenting or using health information is responsible for its quality. According to AHIMA's Data Quality Management Model, there are four key processes for data:\n\n#'''Application''': the purpose for which the data are collected.\n#'''Collection''': the processes by which data elements are accumulated.\n#'''Warehousing''': the processes and systems used to store and maintain data and data journals.\n#'''Analysis''': the process of translating data into information utilized for an application.\n\nEach aspect is analyzed with 10 different data characteristics:\n\n#'''Accuracy''': Data are the correct values and are valid.\n#'''Accessibility''': Data items should be easily obtainable and legal to collect.\n#'''Comprehensiveness''': All required data items are included. Ensure that the entire scope of the data is collected and document intentional limitations.\n#'''Consistency''': The value of the data should be reliable and the same across applications.\n#'''Currency''': The data should be up to date. A datum value is up to date if it is current for a specific point in time. It is outdate if it was current at some preceding time yet incorrect at a later time.\n#'''Definition''': Clear definitions should be provided so that current and future data users will know what the data mean. Each data element should have clear meaning and acceptable values.\n#'''Granularity''': The attributes and values of data should be defined at the correct level of detail.\n#'''Precision''': Data values should be just large enough to support the application or process.\n#'''Relevancy''': The data are meaningful to the performance of the process or application for which they are collected.\n#'''Timeliness''': Timeliness is determined by how the data are being used and their context.\n\n==Health information professionals==\nHIM is a very broad and successful field for [[health care provider|health care professionals]]. There are several career opportunities in Health Information Management and many different traditional and non-traditional settings for an HIM professional to work within.\n\n*Traditional settings include: Managing an HIM medical records department, [[cancer registry]], [[Medical classification|coding]], trauma registry, [[Medical transcription|transcription]], [[Quality management|quality improvement]], [[Release of information department|release of information]], patient admissions, compliance auditor, physician accreditation, utilization review, physician offices and [[risk management]].\n*Non-traditional settings include: consulting firms, government agencies, law firms, insurance companies, correctional facilities, extended care facilities, pharmaceutical research, information technology and [[medical software]] companies.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians].

They play a crucial role in the maintenance, collection, and analyzing of data that is received by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare players. In return these healthcare data contributors rely on the information to deliver quality healthcare.

The term includes routine clinical or office records, records of care in any health related setting, preventive care, lifestyle evaluation, research protocols and various clinical databases. This repository of information about a single patient is generated by health care professionals as a direct result of interaction with a patient or with individuals who have personal knowledge of the patient.\n*The '''primary patient record''' is the record that is used by health care professionals while providing patient care services to review patient data or document their own observations, actions, or instructions.\n*The '''secondary patient record''' is a record that is derived from the primary record and contains selected data elements to aid non clinical persons in supporting, evaluating and advancing patient care.  Patient care support refers to administration, regulation, and payment functions.\n\n===Practices===\n\n====Methods to ensure Data Quality====\nThe accuracy of data depends on the manual or computer information system design for collecting, recording, storing, processing, accessing and displaying data as well as the ability and follow- through of the people involved in each phase of these activities. Everyone involved with documenting or using health information is responsible for its quality. According to AHIMA's Data Quality Management Model, there are four key processes for data:\n\n#'''Application''': the purpose for which the data are collected.\n#'''Collection''': the processes by which data elements are accumulated.\n#'''Warehousing''': the processes and systems used to store and maintain data and data journals.\n#'''Analysis''': the process of translating data into information utilized for an application.\n\nEach aspect is analyzed with 10 different data characteristics:\n\n#'''Accuracy''': Data are the correct values and are valid.\n#'''Accessibility''': Data items should be easily obtainable and legal to collect.\n#'''Comprehensiveness''': All required data items are included. Ensure that the entire scope of the data is collected and document intentional limitations.\n#'''Consistency''': The value of the data should be reliable and the same across applications.\n#'''Currency''': The data should be up to date. A datum value is up to date if it is current for a specific point in time. It is outdate if it was current at some preceding time yet incorrect at a later time.\n#'''Definition''': Clear definitions should be provided so that current and future data users will know what the data mean. Each data element should have clear meaning and acceptable values.\n#'''Granularity''': The attributes and values of data should be defined at the correct level of detail.\n#'''Precision''': Data values should be just large enough to support the application or process.\n#'''Relevancy''': The data are meaningful to the performance of the process or application for which they are collected.\n#'''Timeliness''': Timeliness is determined by how the data are being used and their context.\n\n==Health information professionals==\nHIM is a very broad and successful field for [[health care provider|health care professionals]]. There are several career opportunities in Health Information Management and many different traditional and non-traditional settings for an HIM professional to work within.\n\n*Traditional settings include: Managing an HIM medical records department, [[cancer registry]], [[Medical classification|coding]], trauma registry, [[Medical transcription|transcription]], [[Quality management|quality improvement]], [[Release of information department|release of information]], patient admissions, compliance auditor, physician accreditation, utilization review, physician offices and [[risk management]].\n*Non-traditional settings include: consulting firms, government agencies, law firms, insurance companies, correctional facilities, extended care facilities, pharmaceutical research, information technology and [[medical software]] companies.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians].

They play a crucial role in the maintenance, collection, and analyzing of data that is received by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare players. In return these healthcare data contributors rely on the information to deliver quality healthcare. Managers must work with a group of information technicians to guarantee that the patient's medical records are accurate and are available when needed.\n\nIn the United States, health information managers are typically certified as a [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA) after achieving a bachelor's degree in health informatics or health information management from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) and after passing their respective certification exam.<ref>AHIMA.

Canada currently has 130 originating television stations, which broadcast on 1,456 transmitters across the country, on both the [[VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands.\n\nIn addition to the public [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]/[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada]], which operates both English ([[CBC Television]]) and French ([[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]]) television networks, there are five major private TV networks. [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], and [[Citytv]] broadcast in English, and are available throughout the country. [[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA]] and [[V (TV network)|V]] broadcast in French and operate over-the-air in French-language markets (including Quebec and parts of Ontario and New Brunswick), although are also available across Canada via pay television. Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, TVA and V function in the particular cultural context of [[Quebec television]]. Most network stations are owned and operated by the networks themselves, although all networks have some affiliates with different ownership.\n\nIn addition, the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]], a service devoted mainly to programming of interest to the [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada]], is considered a network by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], although the network airs terrestrially only in the three Canadian territories, and must be carried by all television providers in the rest of Canada. There are, as well, a number of smaller [[television system]]s, such as [[CTV Two]] (a compliment to the main CTV network in smaller and secondary markets), and [[Omni Television]]{{snd}} a group of Rogers-owned ethnic broadcasters.\n\nSeveral provinces maintain provincial public broadcasting networks in addition to the CBC, including [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]], [[TVOntario]], [[TFO]], and [[Knowledge (TV channel)|Knowledge]] (British Columbia). [[Citytv Saskatchewan]] and [[CTV Two Alberta]] were formerly provincial public broadcasters (SCN and Access), but both have since been privatized and amalgamated into commercial networks operated by their current owners ([[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] and [[Bell Canada|Bell]]). While both outlets devote a portion of their schedules to their networks' respective, advertising-supported entertainment programming, both networks are still required to adhere to an educational remit in the majority of their programming. Unlike in the United States, where a statewide public network is usually the state's primary [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station, the provincially owned public systems in Canada are independent of each other and have their own programming.\n\nOnly CBC/Radio-Canada, TVA and APTN are officially considered national networks by the CRTC, while V is a provincial network in Quebec. City, CTV and Global are legally considered \"television services\" even though they operate as networks for all practical purposes. As well, there are a few independent stations, including [[CFTU-TV|CFTU]] in [[Montreal]], [[CJON-TV|CJON]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and [[CJIL-TV|CJIL]] in [[Lethbridge]]. However, most of these are not general entertainment stations like independent stations in the United States, but are instead specialty [[community channel (Canada)|community channel]]s or educational services. CJON is the only independent commercial station currently operating in Canada, although CJON sublicenses a mix of programming from Global, CTV and other sources rather than purchasing program rights independently.\n\nTV station [[callsign]]s in Canada are usually made up of four letters, although two stations have three call letters ([[CKX-TV|CKX]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] and [[CKY-TV|CKY]] in [[Winnipeg]]) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always ''C'', and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the [[ITU prefix|two-letter combinations]] of ''CF'', ''CH'', ''CI'', ''CJ'', or ''CK''. The combinations ''CG'', ''CY'', ''CZ'' and several combinations beginning with ''V'' and ''X'' are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of [[rebroadcaster]]s&mdash;some are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers. Some rebroadcast transmitters are licensed as ''semi-satellites'', which are licensed to air separate commercials (and, on rarer occasions, a limited amount of distinct programming) targeted to their community of license.\n\nCBC-owned stations use call letters beginning with the combination ''CB'' (through a special agreement with the government of [[Chile]]); private affiliates of the CBC use the same combinations as other private stations. The CBC has also sometimes directly acquired former private affiliate stations; these usually (although not always) retain their historic call sign rather than changing to a CB call. While Canadian TV stations are technically required to identify themselves over the air by their call letters, the rule is rarely enforced by the CRTC. As a result, most TV stations never use their call letters for any purpose other than official CRTC business, and instead brand under regional names such as [[CTV Northern Ontario]] or [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]]. Even then, most network-owned stations may only use these brands for station identification and newscasts, and promote the majority of their programming under the network brand without any disambiguation.\n\nDue to their proximity to American media markets, a number of Canadian cities and regions receive US broadcasters as part of their local media. This has required special dispensation for Canadian content for broadcasters in the [[Windsor, Ontario]] region (due to it falling within the [[Detroit]] media footprint), and there has also been a case of a US-based broadcaster ([[KCND-TV]] of [[Pembina, North Dakota]], now [[CKND-DT]] of Winnipeg) targeting its programming and advertising at Canadian viewers.\n\nAlthough all broadcast networks in Canada are required to produce and air some [[Canadian content]], only the English and French networks of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules, though, the English network does run some imported programming from the [[United Kingdom]], most notably ''[[Coronation Street]]''. The private networks, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[Citytv]], have all at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. The commercial networks often find it easier to purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.\n\n[[Digital television]] is an emerging technology in Canada. Although some TV stations have begun broadcasting digital signals in addition to their regular VHF or UHF broadcasts, this is not yet as widespread as in the [[United States]]. Although most markets have digital channel assignments already in place, to date digital broadcasts have only launched in the largest [[metropolitan area]]s. Digital television sets are available in Canadian stores, but are not universally present in all Canadian homes.\n\nSeveral broadcasters, including the CBC, have argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. At [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee similar to that already charged by cable [[specialty channels]], permitting [[Television licence|license fees]] similar to those which fund the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.\n\nIn May 2007, the CRTC set August 31, 2011 as the deadline for digital conversion in Canada. This is approximately two years later than the cutoff date in the United States. The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country,<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home \"Networks unprepared for digital TV shift: CRTC\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628212056/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home/ |date=June 28, 2008 }}, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 24, 2008.</ref> and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.\n\n{{See also|List of Canadian television series}}\n\n==Cable television==\n{{Main|Multichannel television in Canada}}\n\n[[Cable television]] is a very common method of television programming delivery in Canada. Many Canadian cities have cable penetration rates of 90 per cent or more of television households.\n\nThere are currently 739 licensed cable distributors in Canada. This significant decline from over 2000 just a few years ago is attributable both to major cable companies acquiring smaller distributors and to a recent change in CRTC rules by which independent cable operators with fewer than 2,000 subscribers are no longer required to operate under full CRTC licences. (However, the CRTC does retain some regulatory authority over these operators. This is an exemption granted by the CRTC to previously licensed companies that continue to meet certain conditions, and does ''not'' mean that anybody can simply set up their own small cable company without CRTC approval.)\n\nMajor Canadian cable companies include [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]], [[Cogeco]], [[Vid\u00e9otron]] and [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]]/[[Persona Communications|Persona]]. Most Canadian cities are served by only one cable company per market; in the few cities that are served by more than one cable company, each company is restricted to a specific geographical division within the market. For instance, in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Cogeco Cable]], [[Rogers Cable]] and [[Source Cable]] are all licensed operators, but each has a monopoly in a specific area of the city.\n\nHowever, two major companies offer [[direct broadcast satellite]] delivery as an alternative to cable: [[Bell TV]], which is a division of [[Bell Canada|BCE Inc.]], and [[Shaw Direct]], which is a division of Shaw. ''[[Grey market]]'' DBS dishes can also be obtained from American services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]], but as these are not licensed Canadian providers, stores that sell those packages&mdash;and users who buy them&mdash;are at risk of criminal charges.\n\nIn some remote communities in the Territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]]), cable delivery is prohibitively costly, so similar services are offered through [[MMDS]] technology.\n\nA ''basic cable'' package in English Canada traditionally includes:\n\n* the major English-language Canadian commercial networks ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[CTV Two]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[City (TV network)|City]]),\n* [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]], the English- and French-language CBC networks\n* a provincial educational broadcast undertaking (e.g. [[TVOntario|TVO]] in Ontario) (if one is available, as not all provinces have one),\n* a [[Community channel (Canada)|community channel]] produced by the cable company which usually includes public affairs and information programming and community events listings),\n* [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]], a network devoted to [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] programming,\n* [[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA]], one of the two private French-language broadcasters in Quebec<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup>,\n* nearby independent channels or channels from smaller television systems such as [[Omni Television]] or [[Yes TV]]\n* [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]], which broadcasts [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary]] sessions and committee meetings, along with some political public affairs programming,\n* a similar channel broadcasting the proceedings of the provincial legislature,\n* [[network affiliates]], typically from the nearest major American city, of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Network|Fox]], [[NBC]], and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]<sup>[[#Notes|2]]</sup>,\n* a mixture of Canadian and American special interest channels such as [[The Sports Network|TSN]], [[MuchMusic]], [[CNN]], [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]]<sup>[[#Notes|3]]</sup>.\n\nA further set of Canadian and American special interest channels are offered as ''extended cable'' packages, which are available for additional fees. In the past, cable companies have engaged in the controversial practice of [[negative option billing]], in which a subscriber is automatically given and billed for the new services unless he or she specifically declines them, but this is now illegal.\n\nAs well, a package of ''pay TV'' channels is also available for further fees, including movie networks such as [[The Movie Network]], [[Movie Central]], [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] and [[Super \u00c9cran]], and American [[superstation]]s such as [[WSBK-TV|WSBK]], [[WPIX]], [[WGN America|WGN]] and [[KTLA]] (which are often affiliated with [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]].) These services, however, require a [[Cable converter box|descrambler box]].\n\nA study in 2006 said the CRTC had licensed five ethnic specialty and pay-television services, and 44 digital specialty services across the country.<ref name=ojo/>\n\nCable companies now offer [[digital cable]] packages in most Canadian cities, including a number of channels which have been licensed exclusively for digital package distribution. Digital cable also typically includes a range of audio broadcast services such as [[Galaxie (radio)|Galaxie]] and [[Max Trax]]. In some markets, digital cable service may also include local radio stations; where this is offered, it has largely ''replaced'' the availability of [[cable FM]] service. Digital cable, however, is provided only if a customer chooses to subscribe to that package. As of 2016, cable companies are also now required to offer a \"skinny basic\" option, whereby a small selection of channels{{snd}} typically the main over-the-air networks, along with \"public service\" channels such as [[The Weather Network]] and [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]]{{snd}} are packaged for a maximum fee of $25 with additional channels available on a [[A la carte pay television|pick and pay]] basis at the subscriber's discretion.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/skinny-basic-tv-consumers-explainer/article28951724/ \"The skinny on skinny basic TV\"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', March 1, 2016.</ref> Although this package has had some popularity, the traditional larger and more expensive cable packages remain the dominant subscription mode.<ref>[http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/15/skinny-basic-cable-packages-popular-crtc \"'Skinny basic' cable packages popular: CRTC\"]. ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', April 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nAlthough this is sometimes controversial, Canadian cable companies are required by the CRTC to practise [[simultaneous substitution]] when a Canadian channel and a non-Canadian channel (which is usually American) are airing the same program at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Bowl TV commercials \u2013 why are the ads different?|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/tv12.htm|work=crtc.gc.ca|publisher=[[Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission]]|accessdate=September 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011015823/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/tv12.htm|archivedate=October 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Programming on an American service may also be blocked if it has significant bearing on a Canadian legal matter (one episode of ''[[Law & Order]]'', inspired by the trials of [[Paul Bernardo]] and [[Karla Homolka]], was blocked in Canada) or if it interferes with a Canadian channel's broadcast rights (such as [[James Bond]] movies airing on [[Spike TV]]; the Canadian broadcast rights are held by [[Bell Media]].)\n\nMany cable companies also offer high speed [[cable Internet]] service.\n\n===Notes===\n# The other French-language broadcaster in Quebec, [[V (TV network)|V]], does not have mandatory national carriage rights, although some cable companies in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] offer the network on a discretionary basis, and the network does have mandatory carriage in Quebec.\n# Under CRTC rules, American networks are offered on a \"4 + 1\" basis, meaning that a cable company may offer any four American commercial networks and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on basic cable; other American networks can only be offered on a pay tier. In most cities, this means that [[The CW]] and [[MyNetwork TV]] are not available on basic cable because of lower demand for those networks. However, cable providers in border cities have been allowed to offer all American networks on basic cable that are available over the air in that market, even if that means more than four commercial networks are provided. American network affiliates are usually provided from the nearest available American market. However, signals distributed by [[Shaw Broadcast Services]] (particularly affiliates from [[Detroit]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]) are frequently substituted where cost or technical limitations prevent use of a closer signal.\n# Under CRTC rules, cable companies cannot offer a new American service if a comparable Canadian service already exists. However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service has already been added to cable packages, the cable company is not required to discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian cable companies cannot offer [[MTV]], as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, cable companies can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of [[Country Music Television|CMT]] was removed from the lineup when [[CMT (Canada)|a new Canadian country music channel]] called the ''New Country Network'' launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a minority share in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.\n\n==Radio broadcasting==\nCanada is served by approximately 2,000 radio stations, on both the [[AM radio|AM]] and [[FM radio|FM]] bands.\n\nAs with television stations, radio callsigns in Canada are made up of four letters beginning with the [[ITU prefix|two-letter combinations]] of ''CF'', ''CH'', ''CI'', ''CJ'', or ''CK'', although a few stations use three-letter callsigns. In addition to private stations [[CKX-FM|CKX]] and [[CKY-FM|CKY]], some CBC stations have three-letter callsigns, generally in major cities where the stations first aired in the 1930s. Newer CBC stations have normal four-letter callsigns, however. As with CBC television, CBC radio uses callsigns beginning with ''CB'', through a special arrangement with the government of [[Chile]]. A few exceptions, such as [[CKSB (AM)|CKSB]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]] in [[Toronto]], exist where the CBC acquired an existing station with a historically significant callsign.\n\nThe combinations ''CG'', ''CY'', ''CZ'' and several combinations beginning with ''V'' and ''X'' are also assigned to Canada. Only four Canadian radio stations, all in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], have taken call signs in those ranges. Three of these stations, [[VOAR (AM)|VOAR]], [[VOWR]] and [[VOCM (AM)|VOCM]], began broadcasting before Newfoundland was a Canadian province, and retained their ''VO'' call letters when Newfoundland joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949. The other station, [[VOCM-FM]], adopted the callsign in 1981 because of its ownership association with VOCM. With the exception of VOCM-FM, radio stations licensed in Newfoundland after 1949 use the same ''CF''-''CK'' range as other Canadian stations.\n\nThe future of ''VO'' callsigns in Canada is unknown. It would not be at all unusual for [[Industry Canada]] to simplify all callsigns used in Canada as part of the ongoing modernization and simplification of domestic telecom regulations.<ref>[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/sp_dgse-ps_dggs.nsf/eng/gg00073.html Broadcasting undertaking callsigns possibly available for assignment]{{snd}} [[Industry Canada]]</ref>\n\nThere is no clear rule for the call letters of repeater stations&mdash;some repeaters are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters VE or VF followed by four numbers.\n\nAs of 2020, the four largest major commercial radio broadcast groups in Canada are [[Stingray Group]], [[Rogers Radio]], [[Corus Radio]], and [[Bell Media Radio]]. However, many smaller broadcasters operate radio stations as well. Most genres of music are represented on the Canadian commercial radio spectrum, including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]] and [[european classical music|classical]]. News, sports, talk radio and religious stations are also available in many cities. In addition, many Canadian universities and colleges have licensed [[campus radio]] stations, and some communities also have [[community radio]] stations or [[List of Christian radio stations in Canada|Christian radio stations]] licensed to [[non-profit]] groups or [[co-operative]]s. Canada has approximately 14 full-time ethnic radio stations, based primarily in the major metropolitan markets of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.<ref name=ojo>{{cite journal |last=Ojo |first=Tokunbo |title=Ethnic print media in the multicultural nation of Canada |journal=Journalism |date=August 2006 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=343\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/1464884906065517|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fcefb1b87e8dd4258dedc7e38a46cfabab11bcda }}</ref>\n\nAs well, the publicly owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] operates four national radio networks, two each in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The English [[CBC Radio One|Radio One]] and the French ''[[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]]'' provide news and information programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or FM band. The English [[CBC Music]] and French ''[[Ici Musique]]'' provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and are always on FM, generally serving larger communities only.\n\nMusic-based commercial radio stations in Canada are mandated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] to reserve at least 35 per cent of their playlists for [[Canadian content]], although exemptions are granted in some border cities (e.g. [[Windsor, Ontario]]) where the competition from American stations threatens the survival of Canadian broadcasters, and for stations whose formats may not have enough Canadian recordings available to meet the 35 per cent target (e.g. classical, jazz or pop standards).\n\nIn recent years, a notable trend in Canadian radio has been the gradual abandonment of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the FM band. In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) have a much more pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that [[cable television|cable]] companies which offer [[cable FM]] services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for a small percentage of radio listeners in Canada.\n\n[[Digital audio broadcasting]], or DAB, is an emerging technology in Canada. Although many radio stations in major metropolitan markets offer [[digital subchannel]]s with distinct programming from the primary station, not many consumers yet own digital radios and digital broadcasting is usually not available in midsized or small markets. No Canadian radio broadcaster currently operates exclusively in DAB format.\n\nOn November 1, 2004, the CRTC began hearing applications for [[satellite radio]] services. Three applications were filed: one by [[XM Radio Canada]], one by [[Sirius Canada]], and one by the partnership of [[CHUM Limited]] and [[Astral Media]]. These services, which were approved by the CRTC on June 16, 2005, were Canada's first official satellite radio services, although a small ''[[grey market]]'' already existed for American satellite radio receivers. Sirius and XM both launched in December 2005. The CHUM-Astral service, however, was never launched, and its license expired on June 16, 2007; CHUM stated that its business plan was based in part on the expectation that in the interests of Canadian content, the CRTC would have rejected the Sirius and XM applications, approving ''only'' the CHUM-Astral service. The two active services, XM and Sirius, merged into [[Sirius XM Canada]] in 2011, several months after a similar merger between their American counterparts.<ref name=broadcaster>[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ \"Sirius Canada and XM Canada Complete Merger\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810044003/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ |date=August 10, 2014 }}.

When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased by a variety of new ownership groups such as [[Osprey Media]], increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the first time in many years.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s have seen the emergence of city-based [[alternative weekly]] newspapers, geared toward a younger audience with coverage of the arts and alternative news. In recent years, many of these weeklies have also been acquired or driven out of business by conglomerates like [[Canwest]], [[Quebecor]] and [[Brunswick News]]. Smaller newspapers like ''[[The Dominion (Canada)|The Dominion]]'', publishing primarily online but in a newspaper format, have attempted to fill gaps in Canada's journalistic coverage while avoiding the vulnerabilities of the previous generation of [[alternative media]]. Canada has over 250 ethnic newspapers.<ref name=ojo/>\n\nIn the 2000s, a number of online news and culture magazines have launched to provide [[Alternative Media|alternative sources of journalism]]. Some important online publications include ''[[rabble.ca]]'', ''[[The Tyee]]'', ''[[The Vancouver Observer]]'', [[CBC Radio 3]]/[[Bande \u00e0 part (radio)|Bande \u00e0 part]] and ''[[SooToday.com]]''. Alongside this, the 21st century has also seen the closure of a number of long-running local daily newspapers in smaller markets.\n\nThe late 2010s have seen an expansion in online news partisan outlets with ties to the major political parties in Canada such as North99 with the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]  , [[Ontario Proud|The Post Millennial]] with the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and [[Broadbent Institute|PressProgress]] with the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] have received attention though their massive mostly social-based following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadalandshow.com/guide-to-new-popular-populist-political-media/|title=The CANADALAND Guide To New Popular, Populist Political Media|website=www.canadalandshow.com|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\n==Motion pictures==\n{{Main|Cinema of Canada}}\nMost of Canada's film (and television) industry produces output geared towards mainstream [[North America]]n audiences, with [[Alliance Atlantis]] and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] in particular enjoying significant successes in recent years. [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] are major production centres, with Vancouver being the second largest film and television production centre in North America (after [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]). The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is considered one of the most important events in North American film, showcasing both Canadian talent and Hollywood films.\n\nAlliance Atlantis has become by far the largest and most successful Canadian film studio, both as a film and television production house (the company's television properties include ''[[Due South]]'', ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|C.S.I.]]''), and as the major Canadian distributor of independent American and international films. Lions Gate Entertainment has also become a major player in recent years.\n\nCanada also produces films of a characteristically \"Canadian\" nature, and of all Canadian cultural industries, this segment of the film industry has the hardest time escaping the shadow of its (North) American counterpart. Between the marketing budgets of mainstream films, and the largely American-controlled film distribution networks, it has been nearly impossible for most distinctively Canadian films to break through to a wide audience. In many Canadian cities, in fact, moviegoers don't even have the ''option'' of seeing such films, as there aren't any theatres showing them. As a result, a Canadian film is usually considered a runaway hit if it makes as little as $1 million at the box office.\n\nFrench Canadian films, on the other hand, are often more successful&mdash;as with French-language television, the language difference makes Quebec audiences much more receptive to Canadian-produced film. In many years, the top-grossing Canadian film is a French-language film from Quebec.\n\nAs a result of the economic challenges involved in Canadian film production, film funding is often provided by government bodies such as [[Telefilm Canada]], and television services such as [[CBC Television]], [[Crave (TV network)|Crave]] or [[Super Channel (Canadian TV channel)|Super Channel]] are often a Canadian film's most lucrative potential market. However, there is an established network of film festivals which also provide important marketing and audience opportunities for Canadian films. In addition to Toronto's film festival, the smaller [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] features films from around the world, and other major festivals in [[Montreal]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]&mdash;among other cities&mdash;are also important opportunities for Canadian filmmakers to gain exposure among more populist film audiences.\n\nOne particular film production house, the [[National Film Board of Canada]], has become internationally famous for its animation and documentary production.\n\n==Publishing==\n\n===Books===\nCanada's most famous book publisher is [[McClelland and Stewart]], which made its name in the 1970s as the leading publisher of English language [[Canadian literature]]. English Canada also has many smaller publishing houses, including [[Coach House Press]], [[the Porcupine's Quill]], [[House of Anansi]], [[Key Porter Books]], [[Hidden Brook Press]], and [[Douglas & McIntyre]]. Numerous American and British publishers, including [[Random House]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Alfred A. Knopf]] and [[Penguin Books]], also have Canadian divisions.\n\nMajor francophone publishers in Quebec include Biblioth\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, Alire, Qu\u00e9bec-Am\u00e9rique, \u00c9ditions Gu\u00e9rin and Groupe Beauchemin. Several small francophone publishers also operate outside of Quebec, including [[\u00c9ditions Le Nordir]] and [[Prise de parole]].\n\nCanada's largest English [[science fiction]] genre publisher is EDGE Science Fiction and Fantasy Publishing, which now also owns the Tesseract Books imprint, well known for producing excellent Canadian speculative fiction.\n\n===Magazines===\n{{Main|List of Canadian magazines}}\nMagazines published in Canada include:\n\n* ''[[L'Actualit\u00e9]]''\n* ''[[AdBusters]]''\n* ''[[Auto Atlantic]]''{{snd}} East Coast auto magazine\n* ''[[Canadian Business]]''\n* ''[[Canadian Dimension]]''\n* ''[[Canadian Geographic]]''\n* ''[[Canadian Living]]''\n* ''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]''\n* ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]''{{snd}} women's magazine\n* ''[[Chickadee (magazine)|chickaDEE]]''\n* ''[[Enterprise Mag]]''\n* ''[[Exclaim!]]''\n* ''[[Flare (magazine)|Flare]]''{{snd}} fashion\n* ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]''{{snd}} satirical\n* ''[[Geist (magazine)|Geist]]''\n* ''[[Literary Review of Canada]]''\n* ''[[Maclean's]]''\n* ''[[Maisonneuve (magazine)|Maisonneuve]]''\n* ''[[MoneySense]]''\n* ''[[Owl (magazine)|OWL]]''\n* ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]''\n* ''[[Today's Parent]]''\n* ''[[Sharp (magazine)]]''\n* ''[[Toronto Life]]''\n* ''[[This Magazine]]''\n* ''[[Urban Male Magazine|UMM]]''\n* ''[[Up Here (magazine)|Up Here]]''\n* ''[[The Walrus]]''\n\nA notable controversy in Canadian magazine publishing in recent years has been the existence of ''split run'' magazines, where a title published in another country, such as ''[[TIME]]'' or ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', is republished in Canada with a few pages of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian [[advertising]] sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special [[excise tax]] on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.\n\n===Digital===\n{{Main|Canadian online media}}\nOnline only media publishers in Canada include:\n\n* ''BlogTO''\n* ''[[Daily Hive]]''\n* ''Divine.ca''\n* ''Freshdaily''\n* ''View the Vibe''\n* ''The Title Report''\n* ''[[HuffPost Canada]]''\n* ''[[Canoe]]''\n* ''[[Yahoo]] Canada''\n* ''[[Vice Magazine]]''\n* ''MTL blog''\n* ''Swagger (magazine)''\n* ''Trnto''\n* ''[[Torontoist]]''\n* ''Narcity''\n\n\nThe disruption of the media industry in Canada is crazier then ever before. The rise of online media platforms are elimination the need for print media consumption. The controversy lies in whether or not these online media platforms, whether hyperlocal or national, have appropriate practices to enforce standard journalism practices in place. Avoiding \"fake news\" situations. Some of these platforms have been known for using scare-tactics and others to drive traffic.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society|Canada|Journalism}}\n*[[Concentration of media ownership#Canada|Concentration of media ownership in Canada]]\n*[[Media ownership in Canada]]\n*[[Multicultural media in Canada]]\n*[[Canadian Communications Foundation]]\n*[[List of radio stations in Ontario]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last = Armstrong|first = Robert|year =2010 |title =Broadcasting Policy in Canada |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v8uRPaM_VoAC&lpg=PP1&dq=Canadian%20Media&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true|publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn= 9781442640962 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last =Carney |first =William Wray |year = 2003|title = In the news: the practice of media relations in Canada|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr4H_Cmxg4gC&lpg=PP1&dq=Media%20of%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher= University of Alberta Press|isbn=0-88864-382-9 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last =Russell |first =Nick |year =2005 |title =Morals and the media: ethics in Canadian journalism |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=V3RqfJkN-8oC&lpg=PP1&dq=Canadian%20Media&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher= Ubc Press|isbn= 0-7748-1089-0|accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Soderlund |first = Walter C|author2=Kai Hildebrandt |year =2005 |title =Canadian newspaper ownership in the era of convergence |url =https://archive.org/details/canadiannewspape00hild |url-access = registration |quote = Canadian Media. |publisher=University of Alberta Press |isbn= 0-88864-439-6|accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Taras |first = David|author2= Maria Bakardjieva |author3=Frits Pannekoek |year =2007 |title =How Canadians communicate II: media, globalization, and identity  |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=X2YNNHZlt5cC&lpg=PP1&dq=Canadian%20Media&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=University of Calgary Press |isbn= 978-1-55238-224-0 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Vipond|first =Mary |year = 2000|title =The Mass Media In Canada|edition=3rd |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=eUbz3Ipt0xAC&lpg=PA70&dq=Canadian%20Media%20of%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=James Lorimer & Company |isbn=1-55028-714-1 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last =Skinner |first =David |author2= James Robert Compton |author3=Mike Gasher |year =2005 |title = Converging media, diverging politics: A political economy of news media in the United States and Canada |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1mCNXFPLsCkC&lpg=PP1&dq=Media%20of%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn= 0-7391-0827-1|accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Allen|first =Gene|author2= Daniel J.

In 1943, the Association of Canadian Radio Artists (ACRA) was formed as a loose national coalition of actors' groups.

[[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], and [[Citytv]] broadcast in English, and are available throughout the country. [[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA]] and [[V (TV network)|V]] broadcast in French and operate over-the-air in French-language markets (including Quebec and parts of Ontario and New Brunswick), although are also available across Canada via pay television. Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, TVA and V function in the particular cultural context of [[Quebec television]]. Most network stations are owned and operated by the networks themselves, although all networks have some affiliates with different ownership.\n\nIn addition, the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]], a service devoted mainly to programming of interest to the [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada]], is considered a network by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], although the network airs terrestrially only in the three Canadian territories, and must be carried by all television providers in the rest of Canada. There are, as well, a number of smaller [[television system]]s, such as [[CTV Two]] (a compliment to the main CTV network in smaller and secondary markets), and [[Omni Television]]{{snd}} a group of Rogers-owned ethnic broadcasters.\n\nSeveral provinces maintain provincial public broadcasting networks in addition to the CBC, including [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]], [[TVOntario]], [[TFO]], and [[Knowledge (TV channel)|Knowledge]] (British Columbia). [[Citytv Saskatchewan]] and [[CTV Two Alberta]] were formerly provincial public broadcasters (SCN and Access), but both have since been privatized and amalgamated into commercial networks operated by their current owners ([[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] and [[Bell Canada|Bell]]). While both outlets devote a portion of their schedules to their networks' respective, advertising-supported entertainment programming, both networks are still required to adhere to an educational remit in the majority of their programming. Unlike in the United States, where a statewide public network is usually the state's primary [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station, the provincially owned public systems in Canada are independent of each other and have their own programming.\n\nOnly CBC/Radio-Canada, TVA and APTN are officially considered national networks by the CRTC, while V is a provincial network in Quebec. City, CTV and Global are legally considered \"television services\" even though they operate as networks for all practical purposes. As well, there are a few independent stations, including [[CFTU-TV|CFTU]] in [[Montreal]], [[CJON-TV|CJON]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and [[CJIL-TV|CJIL]] in [[Lethbridge]]. However, most of these are not general entertainment stations like independent stations in the United States, but are instead specialty [[community channel (Canada)|community channel]]s or educational services. CJON is the only independent commercial station currently operating in Canada, although CJON sublicenses a mix of programming from Global, CTV and other sources rather than purchasing program rights independently.\n\nTV station [[callsign]]s in Canada are usually made up of four letters, although two stations have three call letters ([[CKX-TV|CKX]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] and [[CKY-TV|CKY]] in [[Winnipeg]]) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always ''C'', and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the [[ITU prefix|two-letter combinations]] of ''CF'', ''CH'', ''CI'', ''CJ'', or ''CK''. The combinations ''CG'', ''CY'', ''CZ'' and several combinations beginning with ''V'' and ''X'' are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of [[rebroadcaster]]s&mdash;some are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers. Some rebroadcast transmitters are licensed as ''semi-satellites'', which are licensed to air separate commercials (and, on rarer occasions, a limited amount of distinct programming) targeted to their community of license.\n\nCBC-owned stations use call letters beginning with the combination ''CB'' (through a special agreement with the government of [[Chile]]); private affiliates of the CBC use the same combinations as other private stations. The CBC has also sometimes directly acquired former private affiliate stations; these usually (although not always) retain their historic call sign rather than changing to a CB call. While Canadian TV stations are technically required to identify themselves over the air by their call letters, the rule is rarely enforced by the CRTC. As a result, most TV stations never use their call letters for any purpose other than official CRTC business, and instead brand under regional names such as [[CTV Northern Ontario]] or [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]]. Even then, most network-owned stations may only use these brands for station identification and newscasts, and promote the majority of their programming under the network brand without any disambiguation.\n\nDue to their proximity to American media markets, a number of Canadian cities and regions receive US broadcasters as part of their local media. This has required special dispensation for Canadian content for broadcasters in the [[Windsor, Ontario]] region (due to it falling within the [[Detroit]] media footprint), and there has also been a case of a US-based broadcaster ([[KCND-TV]] of [[Pembina, North Dakota]], now [[CKND-DT]] of Winnipeg) targeting its programming and advertising at Canadian viewers.\n\nAlthough all broadcast networks in Canada are required to produce and air some [[Canadian content]], only the English and French networks of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules, though, the English network does run some imported programming from the [[United Kingdom]], most notably ''[[Coronation Street]]''. The private networks, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[Citytv]], have all at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. The commercial networks often find it easier to purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.\n\n[[Digital television]] is an emerging technology in Canada. Although some TV stations have begun broadcasting digital signals in addition to their regular VHF or UHF broadcasts, this is not yet as widespread as in the [[United States]]. Although most markets have digital channel assignments already in place, to date digital broadcasts have only launched in the largest [[metropolitan area]]s. Digital television sets are available in Canadian stores, but are not universally present in all Canadian homes.\n\nSeveral broadcasters, including the CBC, have argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. At [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee similar to that already charged by cable [[specialty channels]], permitting [[Television licence|license fees]] similar to those which fund the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.\n\nIn May 2007, the CRTC set August 31, 2011 as the deadline for digital conversion in Canada. This is approximately two years later than the cutoff date in the United States. The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country,<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home \"Networks unprepared for digital TV shift: CRTC\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628212056/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home/ |date=June 28, 2008 }}, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 24, 2008.</ref> and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.\n\n{{See also|List of Canadian television series}}\n\n==Cable television==\n{{Main|Multichannel television in Canada}}\n\n[[Cable television]] is a very common method of television programming delivery in Canada. Many Canadian cities have cable penetration rates of 90 per cent or more of television households.\n\nThere are currently 739 licensed cable distributors in Canada. This significant decline from over 2000 just a few years ago is attributable both to major cable companies acquiring smaller distributors and to a recent change in CRTC rules by which independent cable operators with fewer than 2,000 subscribers are no longer required to operate under full CRTC licences. (However, the CRTC does retain some regulatory authority over these operators. This is an exemption granted by the CRTC to previously licensed companies that continue to meet certain conditions, and does ''not'' mean that anybody can simply set up their own small cable company without CRTC approval.)\n\nMajor Canadian cable companies include [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]], [[Cogeco]], [[Vid\u00e9otron]] and [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]]/[[Persona Communications|Persona]]. Most Canadian cities are served by only one cable company per market; in the few cities that are served by more than one cable company, each company is restricted to a specific geographical division within the market. For instance, in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Cogeco Cable]], [[Rogers Cable]] and [[Source Cable]] are all licensed operators, but each has a monopoly in a specific area of the city.\n\nHowever, two major companies offer [[direct broadcast satellite]] delivery as an alternative to cable: [[Bell TV]], which is a division of [[Bell Canada|BCE Inc.]], and [[Shaw Direct]], which is a division of Shaw. ''[[Grey market]]'' DBS dishes can also be obtained from American services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]], but as these are not licensed Canadian providers, stores that sell those packages&mdash;and users who buy them&mdash;are at risk of criminal charges.\n\nIn some remote communities in the Territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]]), cable delivery is prohibitively costly, so similar services are offered through [[MMDS]] technology.\n\nA ''basic cable'' package in English Canada traditionally includes:\n\n* the major English-language Canadian commercial networks ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[CTV Two]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[City (TV network)|City]]),\n* [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]], the English- and French-language CBC networks\n* a provincial educational broadcast undertaking (e.g. [[TVOntario|TVO]] in Ontario) (if one is available, as not all provinces have one),\n* a [[Community channel (Canada)|community channel]] produced by the cable company which usually includes public affairs and information programming and community events listings),\n* [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]], a network devoted to [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] programming,\n* [[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA]], one of the two private French-language broadcasters in Quebec<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup>,\n* nearby independent channels or channels from smaller television systems such as [[Omni Television]] or [[Yes TV]]\n* [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]], which broadcasts [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary]] sessions and committee meetings, along with some political public affairs programming,\n* a similar channel broadcasting the proceedings of the provincial legislature,\n* [[network affiliates]], typically from the nearest major American city, of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Network|Fox]], [[NBC]], and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]<sup>[[#Notes|2]]</sup>,\n* a mixture of Canadian and American special interest channels such as [[The Sports Network|TSN]], [[MuchMusic]], [[CNN]], [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]]<sup>[[#Notes|3]]</sup>.\n\nA further set of Canadian and American special interest channels are offered as ''extended cable'' packages, which are available for additional fees. In the past, cable companies have engaged in the controversial practice of [[negative option billing]], in which a subscriber is automatically given and billed for the new services unless he or she specifically declines them, but this is now illegal.\n\nAs well, a package of ''pay TV'' channels is also available for further fees, including movie networks such as [[The Movie Network]], [[Movie Central]], [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] and [[Super \u00c9cran]], and American [[superstation]]s such as [[WSBK-TV|WSBK]], [[WPIX]], [[WGN America|WGN]] and [[KTLA]] (which are often affiliated with [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]].) These services, however, require a [[Cable converter box|descrambler box]].\n\nA study in 2006 said the CRTC had licensed five ethnic specialty and pay-television services, and 44 digital specialty services across the country.<ref name=ojo/>\n\nCable companies now offer [[digital cable]] packages in most Canadian cities, including a number of channels which have been licensed exclusively for digital package distribution. Digital cable also typically includes a range of audio broadcast services such as [[Galaxie (radio)|Galaxie]] and [[Max Trax]]. In some markets, digital cable service may also include local radio stations; where this is offered, it has largely ''replaced'' the availability of [[cable FM]] service. Digital cable, however, is provided only if a customer chooses to subscribe to that package. As of 2016, cable companies are also now required to offer a \"skinny basic\" option, whereby a small selection of channels{{snd}} typically the main over-the-air networks, along with \"public service\" channels such as [[The Weather Network]] and [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]]{{snd}} are packaged for a maximum fee of $25 with additional channels available on a [[A la carte pay television|pick and pay]] basis at the subscriber's discretion.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/skinny-basic-tv-consumers-explainer/article28951724/ \"The skinny on skinny basic TV\"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', March 1, 2016.</ref> Although this package has had some popularity, the traditional larger and more expensive cable packages remain the dominant subscription mode.<ref>[http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/15/skinny-basic-cable-packages-popular-crtc \"'Skinny basic' cable packages popular: CRTC\"]. ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', April 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nAlthough this is sometimes controversial, Canadian cable companies are required by the CRTC to practise [[simultaneous substitution]] when a Canadian channel and a non-Canadian channel (which is usually American) are airing the same program at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Bowl TV commercials \u2013 why are the ads different?|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/tv12.htm|work=crtc.gc.ca|publisher=[[Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission]]|accessdate=September 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011015823/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/tv12.htm|archivedate=October 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Programming on an American service may also be blocked if it has significant bearing on a Canadian legal matter (one episode of ''[[Law & Order]]'', inspired by the trials of [[Paul Bernardo]] and [[Karla Homolka]], was blocked in Canada) or if it interferes with a Canadian channel's broadcast rights (such as [[James Bond]] movies airing on [[Spike TV]]; the Canadian broadcast rights are held by [[Bell Media]].)\n\nMany cable companies also offer high speed [[cable Internet]] service.\n\n===Notes===\n# The other French-language broadcaster in Quebec, [[V (TV network)|V]], does not have mandatory national carriage rights, although some cable companies in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] offer the network on a discretionary basis, and the network does have mandatory carriage in Quebec.\n# Under CRTC rules, American networks are offered on a \"4 + 1\" basis, meaning that a cable company may offer any four American commercial networks and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on basic cable; other American networks can only be offered on a pay tier. In most cities, this means that [[The CW]] and [[MyNetwork TV]] are not available on basic cable because of lower demand for those networks. However, cable providers in border cities have been allowed to offer all American networks on basic cable that are available over the air in that market, even if that means more than four commercial networks are provided. American network affiliates are usually provided from the nearest available American market. However, signals distributed by [[Shaw Broadcast Services]] (particularly affiliates from [[Detroit]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]) are frequently substituted where cost or technical limitations prevent use of a closer signal.\n# Under CRTC rules, cable companies cannot offer a new American service if a comparable Canadian service already exists. However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service has already been added to cable packages, the cable company is not required to discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian cable companies cannot offer [[MTV]], as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, cable companies can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of [[Country Music Television|CMT]] was removed from the lineup when [[CMT (Canada)|a new Canadian country music channel]] called the ''New Country Network'' launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a minority share in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.\n\n==Radio broadcasting==\nCanada is served by approximately 2,000 radio stations, on both the [[AM radio|AM]] and [[FM radio|FM]] bands.\n\nAs with television stations, radio callsigns in Canada are made up of four letters beginning with the [[ITU prefix|two-letter combinations]] of ''CF'', ''CH'', ''CI'', ''CJ'', or ''CK'', although a few stations use three-letter callsigns. In addition to private stations [[CKX-FM|CKX]] and [[CKY-FM|CKY]], some CBC stations have three-letter callsigns, generally in major cities where the stations first aired in the 1930s. Newer CBC stations have normal four-letter callsigns, however. As with CBC television, CBC radio uses callsigns beginning with ''CB'', through a special arrangement with the government of [[Chile]]. A few exceptions, such as [[CKSB (AM)|CKSB]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]] in [[Toronto]], exist where the CBC acquired an existing station with a historically significant callsign.\n\nThe combinations ''CG'', ''CY'', ''CZ'' and several combinations beginning with ''V'' and ''X'' are also assigned to Canada. Only four Canadian radio stations, all in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], have taken call signs in those ranges. Three of these stations, [[VOAR (AM)|VOAR]], [[VOWR]] and [[VOCM (AM)|VOCM]], began broadcasting before Newfoundland was a Canadian province, and retained their ''VO'' call letters when Newfoundland joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949. The other station, [[VOCM-FM]], adopted the callsign in 1981 because of its ownership association with VOCM. With the exception of VOCM-FM, radio stations licensed in Newfoundland after 1949 use the same ''CF''-''CK'' range as other Canadian stations.\n\nThe future of ''VO'' callsigns in Canada is unknown. It would not be at all unusual for [[Industry Canada]] to simplify all callsigns used in Canada as part of the ongoing modernization and simplification of domestic telecom regulations.<ref>[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/sp_dgse-ps_dggs.nsf/eng/gg00073.html Broadcasting undertaking callsigns possibly available for assignment]{{snd}} [[Industry Canada]]</ref>\n\nThere is no clear rule for the call letters of repeater stations&mdash;some repeaters are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters VE or VF followed by four numbers.\n\nAs of 2020, the four largest major commercial radio broadcast groups in Canada are [[Stingray Group]], [[Rogers Radio]], [[Corus Radio]], and [[Bell Media Radio]]. However, many smaller broadcasters operate radio stations as well. Most genres of music are represented on the Canadian commercial radio spectrum, including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]] and [[european classical music|classical]]. News, sports, talk radio and religious stations are also available in many cities. In addition, many Canadian universities and colleges have licensed [[campus radio]] stations, and some communities also have [[community radio]] stations or [[List of Christian radio stations in Canada|Christian radio stations]] licensed to [[non-profit]] groups or [[co-operative]]s. Canada has approximately 14 full-time ethnic radio stations, based primarily in the major metropolitan markets of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.<ref name=ojo>{{cite journal |last=Ojo |first=Tokunbo |title=Ethnic print media in the multicultural nation of Canada |journal=Journalism |date=August 2006 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=343\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/1464884906065517|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fcefb1b87e8dd4258dedc7e38a46cfabab11bcda }}</ref>\n\nAs well, the publicly owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] operates four national radio networks, two each in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The English [[CBC Radio One|Radio One]] and the French ''[[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]]'' provide news and information programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or FM band. The English [[CBC Music]] and French ''[[Ici Musique]]'' provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and are always on FM, generally serving larger communities only.\n\nMusic-based commercial radio stations in Canada are mandated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] to reserve at least 35 per cent of their playlists for [[Canadian content]], although exemptions are granted in some border cities (e.g. [[Windsor, Ontario]]) where the competition from American stations threatens the survival of Canadian broadcasters, and for stations whose formats may not have enough Canadian recordings available to meet the 35 per cent target (e.g. classical, jazz or pop standards).\n\nIn recent years, a notable trend in Canadian radio has been the gradual abandonment of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the FM band. In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) have a much more pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that [[cable television|cable]] companies which offer [[cable FM]] services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for a small percentage of radio listeners in Canada.\n\n[[Digital audio broadcasting]], or DAB, is an emerging technology in Canada. Although many radio stations in major metropolitan markets offer [[digital subchannel]]s with distinct programming from the primary station, not many consumers yet own digital radios and digital broadcasting is usually not available in midsized or small markets. No Canadian radio broadcaster currently operates exclusively in DAB format.\n\nOn November 1, 2004, the CRTC began hearing applications for [[satellite radio]] services. Three applications were filed: one by [[XM Radio Canada]], one by [[Sirius Canada]], and one by the partnership of [[CHUM Limited]] and [[Astral Media]]. These services, which were approved by the CRTC on June 16, 2005, were Canada's first official satellite radio services, although a small ''[[grey market]]'' already existed for American satellite radio receivers. Sirius and XM both launched in December 2005. The CHUM-Astral service, however, was never launched, and its license expired on June 16, 2007; CHUM stated that its business plan was based in part on the expectation that in the interests of Canadian content, the CRTC would have rejected the Sirius and XM applications, approving ''only'' the CHUM-Astral service. The two active services, XM and Sirius, merged into [[Sirius XM Canada]] in 2011, several months after a similar merger between their American counterparts.<ref name=broadcaster>[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ \"Sirius Canada and XM Canada Complete Merger\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810044003/http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ |date=August 10, 2014 }}.

In large cities which have more than one daily newspaper, usually at least one daily is a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format. Bilingual cities like [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]] have important papers in both French and English.\n\nCanada currently has two major national newspapers, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and the ''[[National Post]]''. ''[[Le Devoir]]'', though not widely read outside Quebec, is the French-language counterpart to the national newspapers.\n\nThe newspaper with the highest circulation overall is the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while the newspaper with the highest readership per capita is the ''[[Windsor Star]]'' (with the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' running a very close second).\n\nCanadian newspapers are mostly owned by large chains.

When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased by a variety of new ownership groups such as [[Osprey Media]], increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the first time in many years.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s have seen the emergence of city-based [[alternative weekly]] newspapers, geared toward a younger audience with coverage of the arts and alternative news. In recent years, many of these weeklies have also been acquired or driven out of business by conglomerates like [[Canwest]], [[Quebecor]] and [[Brunswick News]]. Smaller newspapers like ''[[The Dominion (Canada)|The Dominion]]'', publishing primarily online but in a newspaper format, have attempted to fill gaps in Canada's journalistic coverage while avoiding the vulnerabilities of the previous generation of [[alternative media]]. Canada has over 250 ethnic newspapers.<ref name=ojo/>\n\nIn the 2000s, a number of online news and culture magazines have launched to provide [[Alternative Media|alternative sources of journalism]]. Some important online publications include ''[[rabble.ca]]'', ''[[The Tyee]]'', ''[[The Vancouver Observer]]'', [[CBC Radio 3]]/[[Bande \u00e0 part (radio)|Bande \u00e0 part]] and ''[[SooToday.com]]''. Alongside this, the 21st century has also seen the closure of a number of long-running local daily newspapers in smaller markets.\n\nThe late 2010s have seen an expansion in online news partisan outlets with ties to the major political parties in Canada such as North99 with the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]  , [[Ontario Proud|The Post Millennial]] with the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and [[Broadbent Institute|PressProgress]] with the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] have received attention though their massive mostly social-based following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadalandshow.com/guide-to-new-popular-populist-political-media/|title=The CANADALAND Guide To New Popular, Populist Political Media|website=www.canadalandshow.com|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\n==Motion pictures==\n{{Main|Cinema of Canada}}\nMost of Canada's film (and television) industry produces output geared towards mainstream [[North America]]n audiences, with [[Alliance Atlantis]] and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] in particular enjoying significant successes in recent years. [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] are major production centres, with Vancouver being the second largest film and television production centre in North America (after [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]). The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is considered one of the most important events in North American film, showcasing both Canadian talent and Hollywood films.\n\nAlliance Atlantis has become by far the largest and most successful Canadian film studio, both as a film and television production house (the company's television properties include ''[[Due South]]'', ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|C.S.I.]]''), and as the major Canadian distributor of independent American and international films. Lions Gate Entertainment has also become a major player in recent years.\n\nCanada also produces films of a characteristically \"Canadian\" nature, and of all Canadian cultural industries, this segment of the film industry has the hardest time escaping the shadow of its (North) American counterpart. Between the marketing budgets of mainstream films, and the largely American-controlled film distribution networks, it has been nearly impossible for most distinctively Canadian films to break through to a wide audience. In many Canadian cities, in fact, moviegoers don't even have the ''option'' of seeing such films, as there aren't any theatres showing them. As a result, a Canadian film is usually considered a runaway hit if it makes as little as $1 million at the box office.\n\nFrench Canadian films, on the other hand, are often more successful&mdash;as with French-language television, the language difference makes Quebec audiences much more receptive to Canadian-produced film. In many years, the top-grossing Canadian film is a French-language film from Quebec.\n\nAs a result of the economic challenges involved in Canadian film production, film funding is often provided by government bodies such as [[Telefilm Canada]], and television services such as [[CBC Television]], [[Crave (TV network)|Crave]] or [[Super Channel (Canadian TV channel)|Super Channel]] are often a Canadian film's most lucrative potential market. However, there is an established network of film festivals which also provide important marketing and audience opportunities for Canadian films. In addition to Toronto's film festival, the smaller [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] features films from around the world, and other major festivals in [[Montreal]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]&mdash;among other cities&mdash;are also important opportunities for Canadian filmmakers to gain exposure among more populist film audiences.\n\nOne particular film production house, the [[National Film Board of Canada]], has become internationally famous for its animation and documentary production.\n\n==Publishing==\n\n===Books===\nCanada's most famous book publisher is [[McClelland and Stewart]], which made its name in the 1970s as the leading publisher of English language [[Canadian literature]]. English Canada also has many smaller publishing houses, including [[Coach House Press]], [[the Porcupine's Quill]], [[House of Anansi]], [[Key Porter Books]], [[Hidden Brook Press]], and [[Douglas & McIntyre]]. Numerous American and British publishers, including [[Random House]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Alfred A.

Several small francophone publishers also operate outside of Quebec, including [[\u00c9ditions Le Nordir]] and [[Prise de parole]].\n\nCanada's largest English [[science fiction]] genre publisher is EDGE Science Fiction and Fantasy Publishing, which now also owns the Tesseract Books imprint, well known for producing excellent Canadian speculative fiction.\n\n===Magazines===\n{{Main|List of Canadian magazines}}\nMagazines published in Canada include:\n\n* ''[[L'Actualit\u00e9]]''\n* ''[[AdBusters]]''\n* ''[[Auto Atlantic]]''{{snd}} East Coast auto magazine\n* ''[[Canadian Business]]''\n* ''[[Canadian Dimension]]''\n* ''[[Canadian Geographic]]''\n* ''[[Canadian Living]]''\n* ''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]''\n* ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]''{{snd}} women's magazine\n* ''[[Chickadee (magazine)|chickaDEE]]''\n* ''[[Enterprise Mag]]''\n* ''[[Exclaim!]]''\n* ''[[Flare (magazine)|Flare]]''{{snd}} fashion\n* ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]''{{snd}} satirical\n* ''[[Geist (magazine)|Geist]]''\n* ''[[Literary Review of Canada]]''\n* ''[[Maclean's]]''\n* ''[[Maisonneuve (magazine)|Maisonneuve]]''\n* ''[[MoneySense]]''\n* ''[[Owl (magazine)|OWL]]''\n* ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]''\n* ''[[Today's Parent]]''\n* ''[[Sharp (magazine)]]''\n* ''[[Toronto Life]]''\n* ''[[This Magazine]]''\n* ''[[Urban Male Magazine|UMM]]''\n* ''[[Up Here (magazine)|Up Here]]''\n* ''[[The Walrus]]''\n\nA notable controversy in Canadian magazine publishing in recent years has been the existence of ''split run'' magazines, where a title published in another country, such as ''[[TIME]]'' or ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', is republished in Canada with a few pages of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian [[advertising]] sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special [[excise tax]] on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.\n\n===Digital===\n{{Main|Canadian online media}}\nOnline only media publishers in Canada include:\n\n* ''BlogTO''\n* ''[[Daily Hive]]''\n* ''Freshdaily''\n* ''View the Vibe''\n* ''Swagger Magazine''\n* ''The Title Report''\n* ''[[HuffPost Canada]]''\n* ''[[Canoe]]''\n* ''[[Yahoo]] Canada''\n* ''[[Vice Magazine]]''\n* ''MTL blog''\n* ''Trnto''\n* ''[[Torontoist]]''\n* ''[https://www.narcity.com Narcity]''\n\nThe disruption of the media industry in Canada is crazier then ever before. The rise of online media platforms are elimination the need for print media consumption. The controversy lies in whether or not these online media platforms, whether hyperlocal or national, have appropriate practices to enforce standard journalism practices in place. Avoiding \"fake news\" situations. Some of these platforms have been known for using scare-tactics and others to drive traffic.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society|Canada|Journalism}}\n*[[Concentration of media ownership#Canada|Concentration of media ownership in Canada]]\n*[[Media ownership in Canada]]\n*[[Multicultural media in Canada]]\n*[[Canadian Communications Foundation]]\n*[[List of radio stations in Ontario]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last = Armstrong|first = Robert|year =2010 |title =Broadcasting Policy in Canada |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v8uRPaM_VoAC&lpg=PP1&dq=Canadian%20Media&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true|publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn= 9781442640962 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last =Carney |first =William Wray |year = 2003|title = In the news: the practice of media relations in Canada|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr4H_Cmxg4gC&lpg=PP1&dq=Media%20of%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher= University of Alberta Press|isbn=0-88864-382-9 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last =Russell |first =Nick |year =2005 |title =Morals and the media: ethics in Canadian journalism |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=V3RqfJkN-8oC&lpg=PP1&dq=Canadian%20Media&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher= Ubc Press|isbn= 0-7748-1089-0|accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Soderlund |first = Walter C|author2=Kai Hildebrandt |year =2005 |title =Canadian newspaper ownership in the era of convergence |url =https://archive.org/details/canadiannewspape00hild |url-access = registration |quote = Canadian Media. |publisher=University of Alberta Press |isbn= 0-88864-439-6|accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Taras |first = David|author2= Maria Bakardjieva |author3=Frits Pannekoek |year =2007 |title =How Canadians communicate II: media, globalization, and identity  |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=X2YNNHZlt5cC&lpg=PP1&dq=Canadian%20Media&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=University of Calgary Press |isbn= 978-1-55238-224-0 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Vipond|first =Mary |year = 2000|title =The Mass Media In Canada|edition=3rd |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=eUbz3Ipt0xAC&lpg=PA70&dq=Canadian%20Media%20of%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=James Lorimer & Company |isbn=1-55028-714-1 |accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last =Skinner |first =David |author2= James Robert Compton |author3=Mike Gasher |year =2005 |title = Converging media, diverging politics: A political economy of news media in the United States and Canada |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1mCNXFPLsCkC&lpg=PP1&dq=Media%20of%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn= 0-7391-0827-1|accessdate = }}\n* {{cite book |last = Allen|first =Gene|author2= Daniel J.

The sedans are designated as a [[compact car]] by [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese dimension regulations]] and the exterior dimensions do not change with periodic updates. The Allion replaced the [[Toyota Carina|Carina]], a model that first appeared in 1970. The [[Toyota Carina ED|Carina ED]], a four-door hardtop coupe that appeared in 1985, was replaced by the [[Toyota Brevis|Brevis]], which was briefly available with the Allion until 2007. Unlike Toyota's other vehicles, the Allion and Premio are  not exported, and are exclusively sold in Japan only.\n\nThe Premio is the successor of the [[Toyota Corona|Corona]] which first appeared in 1957. The [[Toyota Corona EXiV|Corona EXiV]], a four-door hardtop coupe that appeared in 1989, was replaced by the [[Toyota Progr\u00e8s|Progr\u00e8s]], which was also briefly available with the Premio until 2007. The Allion is exclusive to Japanese Toyota dealerships ''[[Toyota Store]]'' as a smaller companion to the [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], while the Premio is exclusive to ''Toyopet Store'' locations, as a smaller companion to the [[Toyota Mark X|Mark X]].\n\nBoth cars are related to the [[Toyota Avensis|Avensis]], which is an imported five-door [[liftback]] from Europe, available at all Japanese dealership locations. The [[Toyota Camry|Camry]], which is the largest car exclusive to ''Toyota Corolla Store'' locations, is slightly larger, and based on appearance packages, offers the same luxury or performance features found in the Allion or Premio. The name \"Allion\" is created based on the phrase \"all-in-one\", while \"Premio\" is a play on words for \"premium\".\n\nMechanically, they are identical to the Avensis which is exported new internationally as well as sold in Japan. The Allion/Premio are only offered as 4-door sedans, while the Avensis is available only as a five-door liftback. The first generation Premio is an upscale, luxurious sedan in comparison to the Allion, which has a more youthful, sporting nature. Wood trim and chrome accents gives the Premio an elegant look while the Allion considered to be a sporty or executive type car.\n\nAppearance modification options made for the first generation Allion are not made or marketed for the Premio. The second generation cars share the interior appearances and optional equipment, with exterior visual differences. Three options packages are offered with the three different engines offered, coupled with the choice of [[Front-wheel drive|front-]] or [[four-wheel drive]], thereby giving Japanese buyers options as to which annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation they are willing to pay.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T240}} First generation (T240; 2001\u20132007) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (T240)\n| image = 2001-2004 Toyota Allion.jpg\n| caption = 2001\u20132004 Toyota Allion (pre-facelift)\n| aka = Toyota Premio\n| production = December 2001 \u2013 June 2007\n| designer = Hiroshi Okamoto (Allion)<ref name=Okamoto>{{cite web |url=http://design-cu.jp/sakuhin_web/a/okamoto_hiroshi/index.html |title=\u5ca1\u672c\u6d69\u5fd7 |trans-title=Okamoto Hiroshi |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Chiba University]] |year=2006 |access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref>\n| related = {{ubl\n  | [[Toyota Caldina (T240)]]\n  | [[Toyota Avensis (T250)]]\n  }}\n| engine = {{ubl\n  | 1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota NZ engine#1NZ-FE|1NZ-FE]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n  | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota ZZ engine#1ZZ-FE|1ZZ-FE]]'' I4 (2WD/4WD)\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota AZ engine#1AZ-FSE|1AZ-FSE]]'' I4\n  }}\n| transmission = {{ubl\n  | 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] (1.5 and 1.8&nbsp;L)\n  | [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] (2.0&nbsp;L)\n  }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4565|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1470|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1170|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe first generation Allion and Premio were launched on 25 December 2001. The Allion has an emphasis towards younger buyers in comparison to the Premio sedan, which has a more elegant approach. The Allion and Premio share the same engines and interior. The Allion can be customized with front spoilers and rear mounted trunk wings, as well as ground effect body parts to enhance the vehicles appearance specially designed and sold by Toyota. The Allion also features rear tilting seats (similar to front seats). The Allion continues the Toyota tradition by being made for taxi usage, driving school and law enforcement versions.\n\nOn 20 December 2004, the Allion received a modest restyle with the introduction of [[LED]] taillights. The Premio also received an update at the same time.\n\nBoth cars were offered with three engine sizes; 1.5-, 1.8- and 2.0-liter. The 2.0-liter model received a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] automatic; the smaller engines were each fitted with four-speed automatic transmission.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:2001 Toyota Allion 20120325 (cropped).jpg|2001\u20132004 Toyota Allion (pre-facelift)\nFile:2004-2007 Toyota Allion A18.jpg|2004\u20132007 Toyota Allion (facelift)\nFile:2004-2007 Toyota Allion A18 rear.jpg|2004\u20132007 Toyota Allion (facelift)\nFile:Toyota premio zzt240 xlpackage 1 f (cropped).jpg|2001\u20132004 Toyota Premio (pre-facelift)\nFile:Jamaica-Toyota Premio.jpg|2001\u20132004 Toyota Premio (pre-facelift)\nFile:2004-2007 Toyota Premio.jpg|2004\u20132007 Toyota Premio (facelift)\nFile:2004-2007 Toyota Premio rear.jpg|2004\u20132007 Toyota Premio (facelift)\nFile:Toyota Allion ZZT 240 60th Annivesary.jpg|Toyota Allion interior\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|T260}} Second generation (T260; 2007\u2013present) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (T260)\n| image = Toyota Allion T260.jpg\n| caption = 2007\u20132010 Toyota Allion (pre-facelift)\n| aka = Toyota Premio\n| production = June 2007 \u2013 present\n| related = \n| engine = {{ubl\n  | 1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota NZ engine#1NZ-FE|1NZ-FE]]'' I4\n  | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota ZR engine#2ZR-FE|2ZR-FE]]'' I4 (2WD/4WD)\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota ZR engine#3ZR-FAE|3ZR-FAE]]'' I4\n  }}\n| transmission = [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4565|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1475|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1440|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe second generation Allion and Premio were introduced on 4 June 2007, with Toyota continuing to offer appearance modifications at local dealerships.

He subsequently participated in combat on [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Bougainville]], and Iwo Jima, where he was one of the six Marines who raised the second of two [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]s on top of [[Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. \n\nThe first flag raised and flown over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on the mountain after it was captured, there was no single photograph taken of Marines raising the flag. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">YouTube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved March 14, 2020</ref> \n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], was modeled after the historic photograph of six Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\n== Early life ==\nBlock was born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block and Ada Belle Brantley, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh day-Adventist]] family.<ref name=TSHA/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |title=Famed Iwo Jima flag raisers gone but not forgotten |publisher=Marines.mil |date= |access-date=2012-05-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007080257/http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |archive-date=2012-10-07 |df= }}</ref> The Block children were: Edward Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford.<ref>Bradley, p. 31.</ref> Edward Frederick Block was a [[World War I]] veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer.<ref>''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]], p. 29.</ref> In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to [[Weslaco, Texas]], a city located in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. His father became a dairy farmer, and the children attended a Seventh-day Adventist private school. Harlon Block was expelled in his freshman year when he refused to tell the principal which student had vandalized the school. Block then transferred to [[Weslaco High School]] and was remembered as an outgoing student with many friends. A natural athlete, Block led the Weslaco Panther Football Team to the Conference Championship. He was honored as \"All South Texas End\".

His rifle company was part of the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marines]] amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi.

Schrier|Harold Schrier]], to take a platoon size patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion's flag to signal the summit was secure. Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battalion. The patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30&nbsp;a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top of the volcano with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas|Ernest Thomas]], Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]],<ref>[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living.

Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Sgt. Hansen, Private Phil Ward, and Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] pitched in to help make the flagstaff stay in a vertical position. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant [[Louis R.

Block (center, behind Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]], soft cap)]]\nLt. Col. Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken up the mountain after he determined that the battalion's flag was too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Mount Suribachi. In the early afternoon, Capt. Severance ordered  Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the larger flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Hayes, and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up the volcano with communication wire (or supplies). Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take \"[[Walkie-talkie|walkie-talkie]]\" batteries and the second flag up the mountain and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant for safekeeping down below. \n\nWhen all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley who carried the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise it. At approximately 1&nbsp;p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the first flagstaff. The second flag was raised by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc.

The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt.

Strank was killed on March 1, Cpl. Block assumed command of Strank's squad in E Company's Second Platoon and, later the same day, Cpl. Block was mortally wounded by an enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Cpl.

Block was originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima on March 5, 1945. A service was held there on March 26 with Pfc. Hayes and other members of E Company in attendance. In January 1949, Cpl. Block's remains was re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the [[Marine Military Academy]] near its Iwo Jima monument in [[Harlingen, Texas]].<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web|title=Block, Harlon Henry|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbl52|website=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.mma-tx.org/about-us/MMA-News/MMA-honors-Iwo-Jima-flagraiser-Harlon-Block/ Marine Military Academy]</ref>\n\n== Second flag-raiser corrections ==\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, larger - edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Rosenthal]]'s flag-raising photograph]]\nOn March 20, 1945, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington D.C. after the battle. Pfc. Gagnon was ordered to Washington and arrived on April 7. He was questioned the same day by a Marine public information officer about all the identities of the flag raisers including himself. He named Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, Pfc. Sousley, Navy corpsman John Bradley, Pfc. Hayes, and himself as flag-raisers in the photograph and that Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action.<ref name=\"marines.mil\"/> Pfc. Hayes and PhM2c. Bradley were then ordered to appear before the officer (Bradley was recovering in the States from shrapnel wounds) and arrived on April 15. They were questioned separately when they each arrived. PhM2c. Bradley agreed with the identities of all the flag-raisers that Pfc. Gagnon's named. Pfc. Hayes agreed with all of the flag-raisers named in the photograph by Pfc. Gagnon except Sgt. Hansen who he said was Cpl. Block at the base of the flagstaff. The Marine lieutenant colonel told Pfc. Hayes that the identities were made public on April 8 and would not be changed, and to not say anything about it anymore (the lt. colonel later denied that Pfc. Hayes ever told him that Cpl. Block was in the photo).<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p. 417.</ref>Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Sousley, and Pfc. Hayes, were in Second platoon, E Company; PhM2c. Bradley was in the Third Platoon, E Company; Pfc. Gangon was a Second Battalion runner (messenger) for E company; and Sgt. Hansen was in Third Platoon, Easy Company.\n\n=== Harlon Block ===\n[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|right|The six second-flag raisers]]\nAfter World War II, a controversy arose as to the identity of the person shown at the right end and bottom of the flagstaff in the famous photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi. When Block's mother first viewed Rosenthal's iconic photograph of the second flag-raising in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, 1945, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, \"That's Harlon\", pointing to the flag-raiser on the far right. She never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon in the photo, insisting, \"I know my boy.\"\n\nIn May 1946, after Hayes was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps (December 1945), he visited Mr. Block at his home in Texas and told him his son Harlon was in the photograph. Afterwards, Mrs. Block persuaded Mr. Block to write their congressman about the matter which he did in September, and the Marine Corps replied that an investigation would be held by them into the identities of the second flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. During the following investigation, Hayes' written statements and his letter to Mrs. Block in September 1945 were instrumental in proving Harlon Block was in the famous photograph and Henry Hansen (he was identified as wearing large parachutist boots on Mount Suribachi) was not; Block, Hayes, and Hansen were former [[Paramarines]]. Rene Gagnon and John Bradley who said it was Hansen, agreed that \"it could be Block\" after learning why Hayes said it was Block. The investigation which began in December and concluded in January 1947, found that it was indeed Block and not Hansen at the base of The flagstaff in the picture, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter.<ref name=\"Investigating Iwo\">{{cite book |editor-last=Robertson |editor-first=Breanne |date=2019 |title=Investigating Iwo: The Flag Raisings in Myth, Memory, and Esprit de Corps |url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Investigating%20Iwo_WEB3.pdf |location=Quantico, Virginia |publisher=Marine Corps History Division |pages=243, 312 |isbn=978-0-16-095331-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Harold Schultz ===\nIn June 2016, a Marine Corps review board looked once more into the identities of the six second flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph, this time concluding that PhM2c.

He subsequently participated in combat on [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Bougainville]], and Iwo Jima, where he was one of the six Marines who raised the second of two [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]s on top of [[Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. \n\nThe first flag raised and flown over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima, so it was replaced on the same day by a larger one. Although there were photographs taken of the first flag flying on the mountain after it was captured, there was no single photograph taken of Marines raising the flag. The second flag raising became famous and took precedence over the first flag raising after the photograph of it appeared worldwide in newspapers. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">YouTube, Smithsonian Channel, 2008 Documentary (Genaust films) \"Shooting Iwo Jima\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOy6yRAB6BY] Retrieved March 14, 2020</ref> \n\nThe [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], was modeled after the historic photograph of six Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\n== Early life ==\nBlock was born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block and Ada Belle Brantley, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh day-Adventist]] family.<ref name=TSHA/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |title=Famed Iwo Jima flag raisers gone but not forgotten |publisher=Marines.mil |date= |access-date=2012-05-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007080257/http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |archive-date=2012-10-07 |df= }}</ref> The Block children were: Edward Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford.<ref>Bradley, p. 31.</ref> Edward Frederick Block was a [[World War I]] veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer.<ref>''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]], p. 29.</ref> In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to [[Weslaco, Texas]], a city located in the [[Rio Grande Valley]].

Block landed on Iwo Jima from the [[USS Talladega]] after transferring off the [[USS Missoula (APA-211)|USS Missoula]]. His rifle company was part of the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marines]] amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi.

Schrier|Harold Schrier]], to take a platoon size patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion's flag to signal the summit was secure. Captain Dave Severance, E Company's commander, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battalion. The patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30&nbsp;a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top of the volcano with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas|Ernest Thomas]], Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]],<ref>[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living.

Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Sgt. Hansen, Private Phil Ward, and Navy [[Hospital corpsman|corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] pitched in to help make the flagstaff stay in a vertical position. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant [[Louis R.

Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken up the mountain after he determined that the battalion's flag was too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Mount Suribachi. In the early afternoon, Capt. Severance ordered  Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the larger flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Hayes, and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up the volcano with communication wire (or supplies). Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take \"[[Walkie-talkie|walkie-talkie]]\" batteries and the second flag up the mountain and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant for safekeeping down below. \n\nWhen all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley who carried the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise it. At approximately 1&nbsp;p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the first flagstaff. The second flag was raised by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc.

Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt.

Sousley was killed on March 21.\n\n==== Death ====\nAccording to the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley), when Sgt. Strank was killed on March 1, Cpl. Block assumed command of Strank's squad in E Company's Second Platoon and, later the same day, Cpl. Block was mortally wounded by an enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Cpl.

In January 1949, Cpl. Block's remains was re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the [[Marine Military Academy]] near its Iwo Jima monument in [[Harlingen, Texas]].<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web|title=Block, Harlon Henry|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbl52|website=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.mma-tx.org/about-us/MMA-News/MMA-honors-Iwo-Jima-flagraiser-Harlon-Block/ Marine Military Academy]</ref>\n\n== Second flag-raiser corrections ==\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, larger - edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Rosenthal]]'s flag-raising photograph]]\nOn March 20, 1945, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] ordered the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington D.C. after the battle. Pfc. Gagnon was ordered to Washington and arrived on April 7. He was questioned the same day by a Marine public information officer about all the identities of the flag raisers including himself. He named Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, Pfc. Sousley, Navy corpsman John Bradley, Pfc. Hayes, and himself as flag-raisers in the photograph and that Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action.<ref name=\"marines.mil\"/> Pfc. Hayes and PhM2c. Bradley were then ordered to appear before the officer (Bradley was recovering in the States from shrapnel wounds) and arrived on April 15. They were questioned separately when they each arrived. PhM2c. Bradley agreed with the identities of all the flag-raisers that Pfc. Gagnon's named. Pfc. Hayes agreed with all of the flag-raisers named in the photograph by Pfc. Gagnon except Sgt. Hansen who he said was Cpl. Block at the base of the flagstaff. The Marine lieutenant colonel told Pfc. Hayes that the identities were made public on April 8 and would not be changed, and to not say anything about it anymore (the lt. colonel later denied that Pfc. Hayes ever told him that Cpl. Block was in the photo).<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p. 417.</ref>Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Sousley, and Pfc. Hayes, were in Second platoon, E Company; PhM2c. Bradley was in the Third Platoon, E Company; Pfc. Gangon was a Second Battalion runner (messenger) for E company; and Sgt. Hansen was in Third Platoon, Easy Company.\n\n=== Harlon Block ===\n[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|right|The six second-flag raisers]]\nAfter World War II, a controversy arose as to the identity of the person shown at the right end and bottom of the flagstaff in the famous photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi. When Block's mother first viewed Rosenthal's iconic photograph of the second flag-raising in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, 1945, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, \"That's Harlon\", pointing to the flag-raiser on the far right. She never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon in the photo, insisting, \"I know my boy.\"\n\nIn May 1946, after Hayes was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps (December 1945), he visited Mr. Block at his home in Texas and told him his son Harlon was in the photograph. Afterwards, Mrs. Block persuaded Mr. Block to write their congressman about the matter which he did in September, and the Marine Corps replied that an investigation would be held by them into the identities of the second flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. During the following investigation, Hayes' written statements and his letter to Mrs. Block in September 1945 were instrumental in proving Harlon Block was in the famous photograph and Henry Hansen (he was identified as wearing large parachutist boots on Mount Suribachi) was not; Block, Hayes, and Hansen were former [[Paramarines]]. Rene Gagnon and John Bradley who said it was Hansen, agreed that \"it could be Block\" after learning why Hayes said it was Block. The investigation which began in December and concluded in January 1947, found that it was indeed Block and not Hansen at the base of The flagstaff in the picture, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter.<ref name=\"Investigating Iwo\">{{cite book |editor-last=Robertson |editor-first=Breanne |date=2019 |title=Investigating Iwo: The Flag Raisings in Myth, Memory, and Esprit de Corps |url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Investigating%20Iwo_WEB3.pdf |location=Quantico, Virginia |publisher=Marine Corps History Division |pages=243, 312 |isbn=978-0-16-095331-6 }}</ref>\n\n=== Harold Schultz ===\nIn June 2016, a Marine Corps review board looked once more into the identities of the six second flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph, this time concluding that PhM2c.

His father  was a sheriff and both his grandfathers had been priests in Ostrobothnia. Hedberg earned a master's of philosophy and theology from the [[Royal Academy of Turku]]. He was ordained a Lutheran priest in 1834 and became curate in [[Siuntio]], then in [[Lohja]].  Dating from  1836, he had supported  the [[Pietist]] revivalist movement led by Savonian farmer and lay preacher [[Paavo Ruotsalainen]].

He wrote  a devotional commentary to 1st chapter of the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]], \"The Doctrine of Faith unto Salvation\" (Eng. transl. 1998), which focused on [[justification by faith alone]], being full of joy about salvation. Hedberg now began a controversy against Pietism, using works of [[Johann Gerhard]], [[Andreas Gottlob Rudelbach]], [[Wilhelm L\u00f6he]], [[Gottfried Thomasius]], [[Gottlieb Christoph Adolf von Harless]] and Catenhusen. His main writing in this controversy is ''Pietism och Christendom'' (1845) where he criticised [[Philipp Jacob Spener]], [[Johann Jacob Rambach|Rambach]], [[Johann Philipp Fresenius]], [[Anders Nohrborg]] and [[Henric Schartau]].

However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

The [[Alak people|Alak]] (21% of the provincial population), [[Katu people|Katu]] (20%), [[Tarieng]] (19%) and Nge/Krieng (11%) are the main ethnic groups.  The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".

However, the province has become much less isolated in recent years, with the upgrading of a major road up from the Mekong valley city of [[Pakse]], plus two major road projects connecting Sekong to Vietnam to the east. Road infrastructure backed by the Vietnamese is part of a regional development strategy spearheaded by Hanoi called the Development Triangle Initiative, aiming to develop links between Vietnam and neighboring underdeveloped provinces in Cambodia and Laos.\n\n==Protected areas==\nThe [[Dakchung Plateau]] is an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA).

However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

The [[Alak people|Alak]] (21% of the provincial population), [[Katu people|Katu]] (20%), [[Tarieng]] (19%) and Nge/Krieng (11%) are the main ethnic groups.  The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".
