Paton's second and third novels, ''[[Too Late the Phalarope]]'' (1953) and ''[[Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful]]'' (1981), and his short stories, ''Tales From a Troubled Land'' (1961), all deal with the same racial themes that concerned the author in his first novel.<ref name=NYTimes/> ''[[Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful]]'' was built on parallel life stories, letters, speeches, news and records in legal proceedings, and mixed fictional and real-life characters, such as [[Donald Barkly Molteno|Donald Molteno]], [[Albert Luthuli]] and [[Hendrik Verwoerd]].

His [[Anglican]] faith was another factor in his life and work: the title of one work is ''Instrument of Thy Peace''. Paton also wrote two autobiographies: ''[[Towards the Mountain]]'' deals with Paton's life leading up to and including the publication of ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' (an event that changed the course of his life) while ''[[Journey Continued]]'' takes its departure from that time onwards.
