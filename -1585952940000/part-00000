{"title_page": "History of chiropractic", "text_new": "{{short description|History of chiropractic}}\n[[File:DDPalmer.jpg|thumb|right|275px|D. D. Palmer]]\n'''The history of chiropractic''' began in 1895 when [[Daniel David Palmer]] of Iowa performed the first [[chiropractic]] adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, [[Harvey Lillard]]. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard bent over to empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, \"I moved the wrong way, and I heard a 'pop' in my back, and that's when I lost my hearing.\" Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie face down on the floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, \"I can hear that rackets on the streets.\"<ref name=\"SciArtPhi\"/> This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word \"chiropractic\" from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[magnetism]], [[spiritualism]] and other constructs that are not amenable to the [[scientific method]], although Palmer tried to merge [[science]] and [[metaphysics]].<ref name=\"Leach 2004 15\">{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Robert|title=The Chiropractic Theories: A Textbook of Scientific Research|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins|isbn=0683307479|pages=15}}</ref> In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States#Osteopathic Principles|principles of osteopathy]] established a decade earlier.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Both described the body as a \"machine\" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/[[subluxation]] to improved health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the [[spinous process]] and [[transverse processes]] as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by [[nervous system|the nervous system]].<ref name=\"lifeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's-Lifeline-chrono.pdf |title=D.D. Palmer's Lifeline |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>\n\nDespite the similarities between chiropractic and osteopathy, the latter's practitioners sought to differentiate themselves by seeking [[licensure]] to [[regulation|regulate]] the profession, calling chiropractic a \"bastardized form of osteopathy\".<ref name=Ernst-eval/> In 1907 in a test of the new osteopathy law, a [[Wisconsin]] based chiropractor was charged with [[practicing without a license|practicing osteopathic medicine without a license]]. Practicing medicine without a license led to many chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, being jailed.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Ironically the Palmers legal defence of chiropractic consisted of the first chiropractic textbook 'Modernized Chiropractic' published in 1906, written by \"mixer\" chiropractors Longworthy, Smith, et al., whom the Palmers despised. Although the chiropractors won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases they were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.\n\nDivision within the profession has been intense, with \"mixers\" combining [[spinal adjustment]]s with other treatments, and \"straights\" relying solely on spinal adjustments. A conference sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1975 spurred the development of chiropractic research. The [[American Medical Association]] called chiropractic an \"unscientific cult\"<ref name=Chiro-PH/> and boycotted it until losing a 1987 [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] case.<ref name=History-Primer/> For most of its existence, chiropractic has battled with [[mainstream medicine]], sustained by [[antiscientific]] and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas such as [[subluxation]].<ref name=History-Primer/> By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic.<ref name=History-Primer/>\n\n== 1890s ==\n\nIn 1895, the world was in the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], marked by innovation and creativity. Health care had emerged from the practice of [[heroic medicine]].

Palmer recalled an incident in 1895 when he was investigating the [[medical history]] of a partially deaf man, Harvey Lillard. Lillard informed Palmer that while working in a cramped area seventeen years earlier, he felt a 'pop' in his back, and had been nearly deaf ever since. Palmer\u2019s examination found a sore lump which he believed was a spinal misalignment and a possible cause of Lillard's poor hearing. Palmer claimed to have corrected the misalignment and that Lillard's hearing improved.<ref name=\"SciArtPhi\">Palmer, D.D. (1910) ''The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic'' Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company</ref>\n\nPalmer said ''\"there was nothing accidental about this, as it was accomplished with an object in view, and the expected result was obtained.

She said that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and, Palmer, who had been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Simons said \"the compact was that if they can make [something of] it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen.\"<ref name=\"Westbrooks\">{{cite journal |author= Westbrooks B |year=1982 |title= The troubled legacy of Harvey Lillard: the black experience in chiropractic |journal= Chiropr Hist |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201353 |pmid=11611211}}</ref>\n\nSince D.D. Palmer's first claim of restoring hearing to Harvey Lillard, there has been controversy about whether a link actually could exist between the spinal adjustment and return of hearing. Critics asserted that a spinal adjustment cannot affect certain areas&nbsp;\u2013 like the brain&nbsp;\u2013 because the spinal nerves do not extend into the encephalon. Years later, V. Strang, D.C. illustrated several neurological explanations including the recognition that sympathetic nerves arising in the lateral horns of the upper thoracic levels of the spine form the upper cervical ganglion with postganglionic fibers ascending to supply, among other things, blood vessels of the brain,<ref name = \"Ess of Chiro\">Strang, V (1984) ''Essential Principles of Chiropractic'' Davenport : Palmer College of Chiropractic, {{OCLC|12102972}}</ref> but still with no connection to hearing. Others, though, talked about [[vertebral subluxation]].\n\n==Early growth==\n[[File:Rev Samual Weed.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Rev. Samuel Weed]]\n\nAfter the case of [[Harvey Lillard]], Palmer stated: \"I had a case of heart trouble which was not improving. I examined the spine and found a displaced vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief&nbsp;\u2013 nothing \"accidental\" or \"crude\" about this. Then I began to reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time.\"<ref name=\"SciArtPhi\"/>\n\nD.D. Palmer asked a patient and friend, Rev. Samuel Weed, to help him name his discovery. He suggested combining the words ''cheiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning \"done by hand\") to describe Palmer's treatment method, creating the term \"'' chiropractic.\"'' D.D. initially hoped to keep his discovery a family secret,<ref name=Martin1993/> but in 1896 he added a school to his magnetic healing infirmary, and began to teach others his method. It would become known as Palmer School of Chiropractic (PSC, now Palmer College of Chiropractic). Among the first graduates were Andrew P. Davis MD, DO, William A. Seally, MD, B.J. Palmer (D.D.'s son), Solon M. Langworthy, John Howard, and Shegataro Morikubo. Langworthy moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa and opened the second chiropractic school in 1903, the American School of Chiropractic & Nature Cure (ASC & NC), combining it with what would become naturopathic cures and osteopathy.<ref name=History-Primer/> D.D. Palmer, who was not interested in mixing chiropractic with other cures, turned down an offer to be a partner.\n\nD.D. Palmer established a magnetic healing facility in Davenport, Iowa, styling himself \u2018doctor\u2019. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: \"A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method\u2026he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims\u2026His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack.\"<ref name=Colquhoun2008>{{cite journal|author=Colquhoun D|title=Doctor Who?

Although some remedies were sold through doctors of medicine, most were sold directly to consumers by lay people, some of whom used questionable advertising claims. The addictive, and sometimes toxic, effects of some remedies, especially morphine and mercury-based cures (known as quicksilver or ''quack''silber in German), prompted the popular rise of less dangerous alternatives, such as [[homeopathy]] and [[eclectic medicine]]. In the mid-19th century, as the germ theory began to replace the metaphysical causes of disease, the search for invisible microbes required the world to embrace the [[scientific method]] as a way to discover the cause of disease.\n\nIn the U.S., licensing for healthcare professionals had all but vanished around the time of the Civil War, leaving the profession open to anyone who felt inclined to become a physician; the market alone determined who would prove successful and who would not. Medical schools were plentiful, inexpensive and mostly privately owned. With free entry into the profession, and education in medicine cheap and available, many men entered practice, leading to an overabundance of practitioners which drove down the individual physician's income.<ref name = \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\">Goodman J, Musgrave G (1992) \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\", excerpted from: John C.

At the time, most medical practitioners were unable to meet the stringent standards, so a \"grandfather clause\" was included. The effect was to limit the number of new practitioners.\n\nIn 1849, the AMA established a board to analyze quack remedies and nostrums and to enlighten the public about their nature and their dangers.<ref name=\"AMA WEB2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1923.html|website=AMA Web site|title=AMA History 1847\u20131899|accessdate=May 27, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101044423/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1923.html|archivedate=2009-01-01}}</ref> Relationships were developed with pharmaceutical companies in an effort to curb the patent medicine crisis and consolidate the patient base around the medical doctor. By the turn of the 20th century, the AMA had created a Committee on National Legislation to represent the AMA in Washington and re-organized as the national organization of state and local associations.<ref name=\"AMA WEB2\"/> Intense political pressure by the AMA resulted in unlimited and unrestricted licensing only for medical physicians that were trained in AMA-endorsed colleges. By 1901, state medical boards were created in almost every state, requiring licentiates to provide a diploma from an AMA-approved medical college.<ref name = \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\"/> By 1910, the AMA was a powerful force; this was the beginning of organized medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/history.htm |title=Healthcare history timeline |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1880, the teaching profession had begun significant changes as well. Advances in chemistry and science in Germany created strong incentives to create markets for their new products. By 1895, the new \"Kulturopolitik\" ideology of \"First teach them; then sell them\" had begun creating the political pressure necessary to improve teaching in science and math in schools and colleges in the US. The medical schools were the first to suffer the attack; they were ridiculed as obsolete&nbsp;\u2013 inadequate&nbsp;\u2013 and inefficient. The crisis attracted the attention of some of the world's richest men. In 1901, John D. Rockefeller created the \"Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research\".<ref name=\"Lerner\">Lerner, Cyrus.

The AMA had created the nonprofit, federally subsidized university hospital setting as the new teaching facility of the medical profession, effectively gaining control of all federal healthcare research and student aid.<ref name = \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\"/>\n\n== Osteopathic medicine vs chiropractic medicine ==\n{{further|Osteopathic medicine in the United States#History}}\n\nIn 1870 Palmer was '\"probably\" a student of metaphysics, became a student of science in 1890 while practicing magnetic healing and after \"discovering\" chiropractic in 1895 attempted to merge [[science]] and [[metaphysics]].<ref name=\"Leach 2004 15\"/> In 1896, D.D. Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic was strikingly similar to Andrew Still's [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States#Osteopathic Principles|principles of osteopathy]] established a decade earlier.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Both described the body as a \"machine\" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction to improve health; chiropractors dubbed this manipulable lesion \"[[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]]\" which interfered with the [[nervous system]].  Palmer drew further distinctions by noting that he was the first to use short-lever manipulative techniques using the [[spinous process]] and [[transverse processes]] as mechanical levers to spinal dysfunction/subluxation.<ref name=\"lifeline\"/> Soon after, osteopaths began an American wide campaign proclaimed that chiropractic was a bastardized form of osteopathy and sought licensure to differentiate themselves.<ref name=Ernst-eval/>  Although Palmer initially denied being trained by [[osteopathic medicine]] founder [[A.T. Still]], in 1899 in papers held at the Palmer College of Chiropractic he wrote:\n\n: \"Some years ago I took an expensive course in Electropathy, Cranial Diagnosis, Hydrotherapy, Facial Diagnosis. Later I took Osteopathy [which] gave me such a measure of confidence as to almost feel it unnecessary to seek other sciences for the mastery of curable disease.  Having been assured that the underlying philosophy of chiropractic is the same as that of osteopathy...Chiropractic is osteopathy gone to seed.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2004 15\"/>\n\n== Medicine vs chiropractic ==\nSince its inception, chiropractic was controversial amongst the established medical orthodoxy. Chiropractors were jailed for \"practicing medicine without a license\" which the profession designed a legal and political defence against prosecution arguing that chiropractic was \"separate and distinct from medicine\", asserting that chiropractors \"analyzed\" rather than \"diagnosed\", and \"adjusted\" subluxations rather than \"treated\" disease.<ref name=History-Primer/> In 1963 the American Medical Association formed a \"Committee on Quackery\" designed to \"contain and eliminate\" the chiropractic profession.

Palmer, whose school had just graduated its 7th student, insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medicine, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs or evaluate blood or urine. In 1901, D.D. was charged with misrepresenting a course in chiropractic which was not a real science.<ref name=\"Lerner\"/> He persisted in his strong stance against licensure, citing freedom of choice as his cause. He was arrested twice more by 1906, and although he contended that he was not practicing medicine, he was convicted for professing he could cure disease without a license in medicine or osteopathy. Dr Solon Langworthy, who continued to mix chiropractic at the ASC&NC, took a different route for chiropractic. He improved classrooms and provided a curriculum of study instead of the single course. He narrowed the scope of chiropractic to the treatment of the spine and nervous system, leaving blood work to the osteopath, and began to refer to the brain as the \"life force\". He was the first to use the word subluxation to describe the misalignment that narrowed the \"spinal windows\" (or [[intervertebral foramina]]) and interrupted the nerve energy. In 1906, Langworthy published the first book on chiropractic, ''Modernized Chiropractic\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"Special Philosophy&nbsp;\u2013 A Distinct System''. He brought chiropractic into the scientific arena.\n\n== B.J. Palmer re-develops chiropractic ==\n{{Main|B.J. Palmer}}\n[[File:Bartlett joshua palmer.JPG|thumb|left|130px|B.J. Palmer, developer of chiropractic]]\n\nD.D. Palmer's student and son, B.J. Palmer, assumed control of the Palmer School in 1906, and promoted professionalism and formal training in chiropractic, expanding enrollment to a peak of above 1,000 students in the early 1920s. Chiropractic leaders of the time often invoked religious imagery, and B.J. seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, deciding against this partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]]. B.J. also worked to overcome chiropractic's initial resistance to the use of medical technology, by accepting diagnostic technology such as spinal [[X-rays]] (which he called ''spinography'') in 1910.<ref name=Martin1993>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Steven C.|title=Chiropractic and the Social Context of Medical Technology, 1895-1925|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=34|issue=4|year=1993|pages=808|issn=0040-165X|jstor= 3106416|doi=10.2307/3106416|pmid=11623404}}</ref>\n\nProsecution of DCs for unlicensed practice after the conviction of D.D. Palmer and a previous charge against B.J. Palmer resulted in B.J. and several Palmer graduates creating the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA).

It was a test of the new osteopathic law. In an ironic twist, using mixer Langworthy's book ''Modernized Chiropractic'', attorney [[Thomas Morris (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Morris]] legally differentiated chiropractic from osteopathy by the differences in the ''philosophy'' of chiropractic's \"supremacy of the nerve\" and osteopathy's \"supremacy of the artery\".<ref name=Barral>Barral, J.P., Croibier, A.

Each school attempted to develop its own identity, while B.J. Palmer continued to develop the philosophy behind his father's discovery. Fueled by the persistent and provocative advertising of recent chiropractic graduates, local medical communities, who had the power of the state at their disposal, immediately had them arrested.

We legally squirmed this way and that, here and there. We did not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. We analyzed, adjusted cause, and Innate in patient cured.

Palmer's management of chiropractic. He challenged B.J.'s methods and philosophy and made every effort to regain control of chiropractic. He repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone(health) of the end organ and noted, \"A subluxated vertebra . . . is the cause of 95 percent of all diseases. . . .

Medical Examining Boards worked to keep all healthcare practices under their legal control, but an internal struggle among DC's on how to structure the laws complicated the process. Initially, the UCA, led by B.J. Palmer, opposed state licensure altogether. Palmer feared that such regulation would lead to [[Medical Doctor|MD]] physician control of the profession.<ref name=\"Chiro Educ\">Phillips R (1998), [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/16/07/23.html ''Education and the Chiropractic Profession''], Dynamic Chiropractic</ref> The UCA eventually caved in, but B.J. remained strong in the opinion that examining boards should be composed exclusively of chiropractors (not mixers), and the educational standards to be adhered to were the same as the Palmer School. A \"Model Bill\" was drafted in 1922 to present to all states that did not yet have a law.<ref name=\"Chiro Educ\"/> They warned state associations to purge their mixing members or face competition by the formation of a new \"straight\" association in their state.\n\nAlthough D.D. and B.J. were \"straight\" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called \"mixers\", advocated the use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed [[X-rays]] as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.<ref name=Martin1993/>\n\nThe mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.<ref name=Martin1993/> That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.<ref name=Martin1993/>\n\n[[File:Frank Margetts.gif|thumb|left|130px|Frank Margetts circa 1922]]\nMixers, disturbed by the edicts of the PSC having so much influence in their daily practice, created the American Chiropractic Association (one of the early precursors to today's [[American Chiropractic Association|ACA]]). Though born out of necessity to defend against the UCA attacks, the ACA's stated purposes were to advance education and research for chiropractic. Its growth was initially stunted by its resolution to recognize physio-therapy and other modalities as pertaining to chiropractic. What growth did occur was credited to its second president, Frank R. Margetts, DC with support from his alma mater, National Chiropractic College. He insisted that no college administrator could hold an official position in the association, giving doctors in the field a collective voice.<ref name=\"Chiro Educ\"/> But a disagreement within the UCA in 1924 turned the tide for the ACA. B.J. was still working to purge mixers from practicing chiropractic, and he saw a new invention by Dossa D. Evans, the \"Neurocalometer\" (NCM),<ref>{{cite journal | author = Moore J | title = The neurocalometer: watershed in the evolution of a new profession. | journal = Chiropr Hist | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 51\u201354 | year = 1995 | pmid = 11613400}}</ref> as the answer to all of straight chiropractic's (and particularly PSC's) legal and financial problems. As the owner of the patent on the NCM, he planned to limit the number of NCMs to 5000 and lease them only to graduates of the Palmer related schools who were members of the UCA. He then claimed that the NCM was the only way to accurately locate subluxations, preventing over 20,000 mixers from being able to defend their method of practice.<ref>Chiropractic History Archives [http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/Neurocalometer/ncm_chronology.pdf Neurocalometer]</ref>\n\nThere was an immediate uproar among practicing DCs. Even Tom Moore, B.J.'s long-time ally and president of the UCA, displayed his dismay by resigning (though he was later reinstated). B.J. reluctantly resigned as treasurer, ending his relationship with the UCA. B.J. moved on to form the Chiropractic Health Bureau (today's ICA), along with his staunchest supporters and Fred Hartwell (Tom Moore's partner) acting as council. Membership in the UCA dropped while the ACA membership rose. In 1930, the ACA and UCA joined to form the National Chiropractic Association (NCA). The NCA developed a Committee on Educational Standards (CES), making John J. Nugent DC responsible for raising educational standards for the profession. The years of consolidation or closing of unacceptable schools while developing the new standards earned Nugent the nickname \"Chiropractic's [[Abraham Flexner]]\" from his admirers and \"Chiropractic's Anti-christ\" from his adversaries. The CES evolved into today's [[Council on Chiropractic Education]] (CCE), and was granted the status of chiropractic's accrediting body by the US Department of Education. Nugent was also instrumental in the Chiropractic Research Foundation (CRF), today's Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER). The differences in state laws that exist today can be traced back to these early legal struggles.\n\nChiropractic struggled with survival and identity during its formative years, including internal struggles between its leaders and colleges.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reflecting on 115 years: the chiropractic profession's philosophical path|journal=J Chiropr Humanit|first=Claire|last=Johnson|date=December 2010|volume=17|number=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1016/j.echu.2010.11.001 |pmc=3342796|pmid=22693471}}</ref> Chiropractic is rooted in [[Mysticism|mystical concepts]], leading to internal conflicts between straights and mixers which continue to this day.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> ''Objective Straight'' chiropractors, who are an offshoot of straights, only focus on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations while traditional straights claim that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases.<ref name=F.A.C.E.-position-paper1>{{cite web |url=http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm |title=Position Paper One&nbsp;\u2013 What is Objective Straight Chiropractic? |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=Foundation for the Advancement of Chiropractic Education (F.A.C.E.) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412203850/http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm |archivedate=2008-04-12 }}</ref> ''Reform'' chiropractors are an [[evidence-based]] offshoot of mixers who reject traditional Palmer philosophy and tend not to use [[alternative medicine]] methods.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mirtz TA, Long P, Dinehart A, etal |title=NACM and its argument with mainstream chiropractic health care |journal=J Controv Med Claims |year=2002 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=11\u201318 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25525357_ITM}} See: [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]]</ref> From 1984 to about 2008, some of them were organized as the [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]], an organization which met strong opposition from the profession and finally ceased to exist.<!-- See [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]] for details and references. -->\n\n==Debate==\nThere is continued disagreement over what \"innate\" and \"subluxation\" mean to chiropractic.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Intern Med |year=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215\u201324 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |vauthors=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215}}</ref> Some chiropractors believe in [[Innate Intelligence]], a faith-based, unscientific belief which has been a source of derision for chiropractors.<ref name=\"Keating2002\">{{cite journal | title = The Meanings of Innate | journal = Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association | date = March 2002 | first = Joseph C. | last = Keating | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 4\u201310| pmc=2505097}}</ref> Chiropractors historically were strongly [[vaccine hesitancy|opposed to vaccination]] based on their belief that all diseases were traceable to causes in the spine, and therefore could not be affected by vaccines; D.D.

The medical division contained all the standard medical tests of the time and was used to establish a medical diagnosis of a patient's condition before the patient received treatment. The chiropractic division administered the treatment which included passive therapies, chiropractic adjustments and physical rehabilitation for the various conditions diagnosed. Research continued in the B.J. Palmer research clinic until B.J. Palmer's death in 1961 and the results and findings of these patient cases were the substance of B.J. Palmer's publishing over this 30 year time-period.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chiropractic: An Illustrated History|year=1995|publisher=Elsevier - Health Sciences Division|location=St Louis/US|isbn=978-0-8016-7735-9|pages=170\u201371|author1=Dennis Peterson |author2=Glenda Wiese }}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1950s, healthcare in the US had been transformed: the discovery of penicillin and development of the polio vaccine was restoring hope to millions, and the homeopathic physician had all but vanished as a result of \"antiquackery\" efforts of the medical trust and leadership efforts of the AMA. B.J. reduced the adjustment to HIO (Hole In One&nbsp;\u2013 the adjustment of only the atlas), while mixers continued to add and refine new proprietary techniques to find and reduce subluxations and improve health. Osteopathy in the US developed in parallel to medicine and dropped its reliance on spinal manipulation to treat illness. A similar reform movement began within chiropractic: shortly after the death of B.J. in 1961, a second generation chiropractor, Samuel Homola, wrote extensively on the subject of limiting the use of spinal manipulation, proposing that chiropractic as a medical specialty should focus on conservative care of musculoskeletal conditions.<ref name=\"Homola Chiros as EBM\">Homola S (2006), [http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf Can Chiropractors and Evidence-Based Manual Therapists Work Together?

While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard bent over to empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, \"I moved the wrong way, and I heard a 'pop' in my back, and that's when I lost my hearing.\" Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie face down on the floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, \"I can hear that rackets on the streets.\"<ref name=\"SciArtPhi\"/> This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word \"chiropractic\" from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[magnetism]], [[spiritualism]] and other constructs that are not amenable to the [[scientific method]], although Palmer tried to merge [[science]] and [[metaphysics]].<ref name=\"Leach 2004 15\">{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Robert|title=The Chiropractic Theories: A Textbook of Scientific Research|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins|isbn=0683307479|pages=15}}</ref> In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States#Osteopathic Principles|principles of osteopathy]] established a decade earlier.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Both described the body as a \"machine\" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/[[subluxation]] to improved health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the [[spinous process]] and [[transverse processes]] as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by [[nervous system|the nervous system]].<ref name=\"lifeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's-Lifeline-chrono.pdf |title=D.D.

Practicing medicine without a license led to many chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, being jailed.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Ironically the Palmers legal defence of chiropractic consisted of the first chiropractic textbook 'Modernized Chiropractic' published in 1906, written by \"mixer\" chiropractors Longworthy, Smith, et al., whom the Palmers despised. Although the chiropractors won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases they were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.\n\nDivision within the profession has been intense, with \"mixers\" combining [[spinal adjustment]]s with other treatments, and \"straights\" relying solely on spinal adjustments. A conference sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1975 spurred the development of chiropractic research. The [[American Medical Association]] called chiropractic an \"unscientific cult\"<ref name=Chiro-PH/> and boycotted it until losing a 1987 [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] case.<ref name=History-Primer/> For most of its existence, chiropractic has battled with [[mainstream medicine]], sustained by [[antiscientific]] and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas such as [[subluxation]].<ref name=History-Primer/> By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic.<ref name=History-Primer/>\n\n== 1890s ==\n\nIn 1895, the world was in the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], marked by innovation and creativity.

Palmer recalled an incident in 1895 when he was investigating the [[medical history]] of a partially deaf man, Harvey Lillard. Lillard informed Palmer that while working in a cramped area seventeen years earlier, he felt a 'pop' in his back, and had been nearly deaf ever since. Palmer\u2019s examination found a sore lump which he believed was a spinal misalignment and a possible cause of Lillard's poor hearing. Palmer claimed to have corrected the misalignment and that Lillard's hearing improved.<ref name=\"SciArtPhi\">Palmer, D.D. (1910) ''The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic'' Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company</ref>\n\nPalmer said ''\"there was nothing accidental about this, as it was accomplished with an object in view, and the expected result was obtained.

She said that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and, Palmer, who had been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Simons said \"the compact was that if they can make [something of] it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen.\"<ref name=\"Westbrooks\">{{cite journal |author= Westbrooks B |year=1982 |title= The troubled legacy of Harvey Lillard: the black experience in chiropractic |journal= Chiropr Hist |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201353 |pmid=11611211}}</ref>\n\nSince D.D. Palmer's first claim of restoring hearing to Harvey Lillard, there has been controversy about whether a link actually could exist between the spinal adjustment and return of hearing. Critics asserted that a spinal adjustment cannot affect certain areas&nbsp;\u2013 like the brain&nbsp;\u2013 because the spinal nerves do not extend into the encephalon. Years later, V. Strang, D.C. illustrated several neurological explanations including the recognition that sympathetic nerves arising in the lateral horns of the upper thoracic levels of the spine form the upper cervical ganglion with postganglionic fibers ascending to supply, among other things, blood vessels of the brain,<ref name = \"Ess of Chiro\">Strang, V (1984) ''Essential Principles of Chiropractic'' Davenport : Palmer College of Chiropractic, {{OCLC|12102972}}</ref> but still with no connection to hearing. Others, though, talked about [[vertebral subluxation]].\n\n==Early growth==\n[[File:Rev Samual Weed.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Rev. Samuel Weed]]\n\nAfter the case of [[Harvey Lillard]], Palmer stated: \"I had a case of heart trouble which was not improving. I examined the spine and found a displaced vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief&nbsp;\u2013 nothing \"accidental\" or \"crude\" about this. Then I began to reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time.\"<ref name=\"SciArtPhi\"/>\n\nD.D. Palmer asked a patient and friend, Rev. Samuel Weed, to help him name his discovery. He suggested combining the words ''cheiros'' and ''praktikos'' (meaning \"done by hand\") to describe Palmer's treatment method, creating the term \"''chiropractic.\"'' D.D. initially hoped to keep his discovery a family secret,<ref name=Martin1993/> but in 1896 he added a school to his magnetic healing infirmary, and began to teach others his method. It would become known as Palmer School of Chiropractic (PSC, now Palmer College of Chiropractic). Among the first graduates were Andrew P. Davis MD, DO, William A. Seally, MD, B.J. Palmer (D.D.'s son), Solon M. Langworthy, John Howard, and Shegataro Morikubo. Langworthy moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa and opened the second chiropractic school in 1903, the American School of Chiropractic & Nature Cure (ASC & NC), combining it with what would become naturopathic cures and osteopathy.<ref name=History-Primer/> D.D. Palmer, who was not interested in mixing chiropractic with other cures, turned down an offer to be a partner.\n\nD.D. Palmer established a magnetic healing facility in Davenport, Iowa, styling himself \u2018doctor\u2019. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: \"A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method\u2026he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims\u2026His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack.\"<ref name=Colquhoun2008>{{cite journal|author=Colquhoun D|title=Doctor Who?

Although some remedies were sold through doctors of medicine, most were sold directly to consumers by lay people, some of whom used questionable advertising claims. The addictive, and sometimes toxic, effects of some remedies, especially morphine and mercury-based cures (known as quicksilver or ''quack''silber in German), prompted the popular rise of less dangerous alternatives, such as [[homeopathy]] and [[eclectic medicine]]. In the mid-19th century, as the germ theory began to replace the metaphysical causes of disease, the search for invisible microbes required the world to embrace the [[scientific method]] as a way to discover the cause of disease.\n\nIn the U.S., licensing for healthcare professionals had all but vanished around the time of the Civil War, leaving the profession open to anyone who felt inclined to become a physician; the market alone determined who would prove successful and who would not. Medical schools were plentiful, inexpensive and mostly privately owned. With free entry into the profession, and education in medicine cheap and available, many men entered practice, leading to an overabundance of practitioners which drove down the individual physician's income.<ref name = \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\">Goodman J, Musgrave G (1992) \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\", excerpted from: John C.

At the time, most medical practitioners were unable to meet the stringent standards, so a \"grandfather clause\" was included. The effect was to limit the number of new practitioners.\n\nIn 1849, the AMA established a board to analyze quack remedies and nostrums and to enlighten the public about their nature and their dangers.<ref name=\"AMA WEB2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1923.html|website=AMA Web site|title=AMA History 1847\u20131899|accessdate=May 27, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101044423/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1923.html|archivedate=2009-01-01}}</ref> Relationships were developed with pharmaceutical companies in an effort to curb the patent medicine crisis and consolidate the patient base around the medical doctor. By the turn of the 20th century, the AMA had created a Committee on National Legislation to represent the AMA in Washington and re-organized as the national organization of state and local associations.<ref name=\"AMA WEB2\"/> Intense political pressure by the AMA resulted in unlimited and unrestricted licensing only for medical physicians that were trained in AMA-endorsed colleges. By 1901, state medical boards were created in almost every state, requiring licentiates to provide a diploma from an AMA-approved medical college.<ref name = \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\"/> By 1910, the AMA was a powerful force; this was the beginning of organized medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/history.htm |title=Healthcare history timeline |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1880, the teaching profession had begun significant changes as well. Advances in chemistry and science in Germany created strong incentives to create markets for their new products. By 1895, the new \"Kulturopolitik\" ideology of \"First teach them; then sell them\" had begun creating the political pressure necessary to improve teaching in science and math in schools and colleges in the US. The medical schools were the first to suffer the attack; they were ridiculed as obsolete&nbsp;\u2013 inadequate&nbsp;\u2013 and inefficient. The crisis attracted the attention of some of the world's richest men. In 1901, John D. Rockefeller created the \"Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research\".<ref name=\"Lerner\">Lerner, Cyrus.

The AMA had created the nonprofit, federally subsidized university hospital setting as the new teaching facility of the medical profession, effectively gaining control of all federal healthcare research and student aid.<ref name = \"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\"/>\n\n== Osteopathic medicine vs chiropractic medicine ==\n{{further|Osteopathic medicine in the United States#History}}\n\nIn 1870 Palmer was '\"probably\" a student of metaphysics, became a student of science in 1890 while practicing magnetic healing and after \"discovering\" chiropractic in 1895 attempted to merge [[science]] and [[metaphysics]].<ref name=\"Leach 2004 15\"/> In 1896, D.D. Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic was strikingly similar to Andrew Still's [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States#Osteopathic Principles|principles of osteopathy]] established a decade earlier.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> Both described the body as a \"machine\" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction to improve health; chiropractors dubbed this manipulable lesion \"[[vertebral subluxation|subluxation]]\" which interfered with the [[nervous system]].  Palmer drew further distinctions by noting that he was the first to use short-lever manipulative techniques using the [[spinous process]] and [[transverse processes]] as mechanical levers to spinal dysfunction/subluxation.<ref name=\"lifeline\"/> Soon after, osteopaths began an American wide campaign proclaimed that chiropractic was a bastardized form of osteopathy and sought licensure to differentiate themselves.<ref name=Ernst-eval/>  Although Palmer initially denied being trained by [[osteopathic medicine]] founder [[A.T. Still]], in 1899 in papers held at the Palmer College of Chiropractic he wrote:\n\n: \"Some years ago I took an expensive course in Electropathy, Cranial Diagnosis, Hydrotherapy, Facial Diagnosis. Later I took Osteopathy [which] gave me such a measure of confidence as to almost feel it unnecessary to seek other sciences for the mastery of curable disease.  Having been assured that the underlying philosophy of chiropractic is the same as that of osteopathy...Chiropractic is osteopathy gone to seed.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2004 15\"/>\n\n== Medicine vs chiropractic ==\nSince its inception, chiropractic was controversial amongst the established medical orthodoxy. Chiropractors were jailed for \"practicing medicine without a license\" which the profession designed a legal and political defence against prosecution arguing that chiropractic was \"separate and distinct from medicine\", asserting that chiropractors \"analyzed\" rather than \"diagnosed\", and \"adjusted\" subluxations rather than \"treated\" disease.<ref name=History-Primer/> In 1963 the American Medical Association formed a \"Committee on Quackery\" designed to \"contain and eliminate\" the chiropractic profession. In 1966, the AMA referred to chiropractic an \"unscientific cult\" and until 1980 and held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate themselves with \"unscientific practitioners\".<ref name=Chiro-PH>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |year=2008 |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=397\u2013410 |title= Chiropractic and public health: current state and future vision  |vauthors=Johnson C, Baird R, Dougherty PE, etal |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.07.001 |pmid=18722194 |url=http://jmptonline.org/article/PIIS0161475408001784/fulltext}}</ref> Then in 1987, the AMA was found to have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade \"to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/29/us/us-judge-finds-medical-group-conspired-against-chiropractors.html|title=U.S. Judge Finds Medical Group Conspired Against Chiropractors|last=Ap|date=1987-08-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In the 1980s, spinal manipulation gained mainstream recognition<ref>{{cite web |url=http://muaphysicians.com/historical.html |publisher= International MUA Academy of Physicians |title= Manipulation under anesthesia: historical considerations |author= Francis RS |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> and has spurred ongoing collaboration into research of manipulative therapies and models of delivery of chiropractic care for musculoskeletal conditions in the mainstream healthcare sector.<ref name=\"DeVocht-JW\">{{cite journal|journal=Clin Orthop Relat Res|year=2006|volume=444|pages=243\u201349|title=History and overview of theories and methods of chiropractic: a counterpoint|author=DeVocht JW|doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000203460.89887.8d|pmid=16523145 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Mior S, Barnsley J, Boon H, Ashbury FD, Haig R |title=Designing a framework for the delivery of collaborative musculoskeletal care involving chiropractors and physicians in community-based primary care.|journal=J Interprof Care|date=Nov 2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=678\u201389|pmid=20441400|doi=10.3109/13561821003608757}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Mior S, Gamble B, Barnsley J, C\u00f4t\u00e9 P, C\u00f4t\u00e9 E.|title=Changes in primary care physician's management of low back pain in a model of interprofessional collaborative care: an uncontrolled before-after study.|journal=Chiropr Man Ther|date=Feb 2013|volume=21|issue=1|doi=10.1186/2045-709x-21-6}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1899, a medical doctor in Davenport named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless healers in Iowa, demanding a change in the statute to prevent drugless healers from practicing in the state and claiming that health education could no longer be entrusted to anyone but doctors of medicine.<ref name=\"Lerner\"/> Osteopathic schools across the country responded by developing a program of college inspection and accreditation.<ref name=\"lifeline\"/> D.D. Palmer, whose school had just graduated its 7th student, insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medicine, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs or evaluate blood or urine. In 1901, D.D. was charged with misrepresenting a course in chiropractic which was not a real science.<ref name=\"Lerner\"/> He persisted in his strong stance against licensure, citing freedom of choice as his cause. He was arrested twice more by 1906, and although he contended that he was not practicing medicine, he was convicted for professing he could cure disease without a license in medicine or osteopathy. Dr Solon Langworthy, who continued to mix chiropractic at the ASC&NC, took a different route for chiropractic. He improved classrooms and provided a curriculum of study instead of the single course. He narrowed the scope of chiropractic to the treatment of the spine and nervous system, leaving blood work to the osteopath, and began to refer to the brain as the \"life force\". He was the first to use the word subluxation to describe the misalignment that narrowed the \"spinal windows\" (or [[intervertebral foramina]]) and interrupted the nerve energy. In 1906, Langworthy published the first book on chiropractic, ''Modernized Chiropractic\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"Special Philosophy&nbsp;\u2013 A Distinct System''. He brought chiropractic into the scientific arena.\n\n== B.J. Palmer re-develops chiropractic ==\n{{Main|B.J. Palmer}}\n[[File:Bartlett joshua palmer.JPG|thumb|left|130px|B.J. Palmer, developer of chiropractic]]\n\nD.D. Palmer's student and son, B.J. Palmer, assumed control of the Palmer School in 1906, and promoted professionalism and formal training in chiropractic, expanding enrollment to a peak of above 1,000 students in the early 1920s. Chiropractic leaders of the time often invoked religious imagery, and B.J. seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, deciding against this partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]]. B.J. also worked to overcome chiropractic's initial resistance to the use of medical technology, by accepting diagnostic technology such as spinal [[X-rays]] (which he called ''spinography'') in 1910.<ref name=Martin1993>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Steven C.|title=Chiropractic and the Social Context of Medical Technology, 1895-1925|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=34|issue=4|year=1993|pages=808|issn=0040-165X|jstor= 3106416|doi=10.2307/3106416|pmid=11623404}}</ref>\n\nProsecution of DCs for unlicensed practice after the conviction of D.D. Palmer and a previous charge against B.J. Palmer resulted in B.J. and several Palmer graduates creating the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA).

It was a test of the new osteopathic law. In an ironic twist, using mixer Langworthy's book ''Modernized Chiropractic'', attorney [[Thomas Morris (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Morris]] legally differentiated chiropractic from osteopathy by the differences in the ''philosophy'' of chiropractic's \"supremacy of the nerve\" and osteopathy's \"supremacy of the artery\".<ref name=Barral>Barral, J.P., Croibier, A.

Each school attempted to develop its own identity, while B.J. Palmer continued to develop the philosophy behind his father's discovery. Fueled by the persistent and provocative advertising of recent chiropractic graduates, local medical communities, who had the power of the state at their disposal, immediately had them arrested.

B.J. would later note about those battles:\n\n:\"We are always mindful of those early days when UCA...used various expedients to defeat medical court prosecutions. We legally squirmed this way and that, here and there. We did not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. We analyzed, adjusted cause, and Innate in patient cured.

Palmer's management of chiropractic. He challenged B.J.'s methods and philosophy and made every effort to regain control of chiropractic. He repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone(health) of the end organ and noted, \"A subluxated vertebra . . . is the cause of 95 percent of all diseases. . . .

Palmer feared that such regulation would lead to [[Medical Doctor|MD]] physician control of the profession.<ref name=\"Chiro Educ\">Phillips R (1998), [http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/16/07/23.html ''Education and the Chiropractic Profession''], Dynamic Chiropractic</ref> The UCA eventually caved in, but B.J. remained strong in the opinion that examining boards should be composed exclusively of chiropractors (not mixers), and the educational standards to be adhered to were the same as the Palmer School. A \"Model Bill\" was drafted in 1922 to present to all states that did not yet have a law.<ref name=\"Chiro Educ\"/> They warned state associations to purge their mixing members or face competition by the formation of a new \"straight\" association in their state.\n\nAlthough D.D. and B.J. were \"straight\" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called \"mixers\", advocated the use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed [[X-rays]] as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.<ref name=Martin1993/>\n\nThe mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.<ref name=Martin1993/> That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.<ref name=Martin1993/>\n\n[[File:Frank Margetts.gif|thumb|left|130px|Frank Margetts circa 1922]]\nMixers, disturbed by the edicts of the PSC having so much influence in their daily practice, created the American Chiropractic Association (one of the early precursors to today's [[American Chiropractic Association|ACA]]). Though born out of necessity to defend against the UCA attacks, the ACA's stated purposes were to advance education and research for chiropractic. Its growth was initially stunted by its resolution to recognize physio-therapy and other modalities as pertaining to chiropractic. What growth did occur was credited to its second president, Frank R. Margetts, DC with support from his alma mater, National Chiropractic College. He insisted that no college administrator could hold an official position in the association, giving doctors in the field a collective voice.<ref name=\"Chiro Educ\"/> But a disagreement within the UCA in 1924 turned the tide for the ACA. B.J. was still working to purge mixers from practicing chiropractic, and he saw a new invention by Dossa D. Evans, the \"Neurocalometer\" (NCM),<ref>{{cite journal | author = Moore J | title = The neurocalometer: watershed in the evolution of a new profession. | journal = Chiropr Hist | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 51\u201354 | year = 1995 | pmid = 11613400}}</ref> as the answer to all of straight chiropractic's (and particularly PSC's) legal and financial problems. As the owner of the patent on the NCM, he planned to limit the number of NCMs to 5000 and lease them only to graduates of the Palmer related schools who were members of the UCA. He then claimed that the NCM was the only way to accurately locate subluxations, preventing over 20,000 mixers from being able to defend their method of practice.<ref>Chiropractic History Archives [http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/Neurocalometer/ncm_chronology.pdf Neurocalometer]</ref>\n\nThere was an immediate uproar among practicing DCs. Even Tom Moore, B.J.'s long-time ally and president of the UCA, displayed his dismay by resigning (though he was later reinstated). B.J. reluctantly resigned as treasurer, ending his relationship with the UCA. B.J. moved on to form the Chiropractic Health Bureau (today's ICA), along with his staunchest supporters and Fred Hartwell (Tom Moore's partner) acting as council. Membership in the UCA dropped while the ACA membership rose. In 1930, the ACA and UCA joined to form the National Chiropractic Association (NCA). The NCA developed a Committee on Educational Standards (CES), making John J. Nugent DC responsible for raising educational standards for the profession. The years of consolidation or closing of unacceptable schools while developing the new standards earned Nugent the nickname \"Chiropractic's [[Abraham Flexner]]\" from his admirers and \"Chiropractic's Anti-christ\" from his adversaries. The CES evolved into today's [[Council on Chiropractic Education]] (CCE), and was granted the status of chiropractic's accrediting body by the US Department of Education. Nugent was also instrumental in the Chiropractic Research Foundation (CRF), today's Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER). The differences in state laws that exist today can be traced back to these early legal struggles.\n\nChiropractic struggled with survival and identity during its formative years, including internal struggles between its leaders and colleges.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reflecting on 115 years: the chiropractic profession's philosophical path|journal=J Chiropr Humanit|first=Claire|last=Johnson|date=December 2010|volume=17|number=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1016/j.echu.2010.11.001 |pmc=3342796|pmid=22693471}}</ref> Chiropractic is rooted in [[Mysticism|mystical concepts]], leading to internal conflicts between straights and mixers which continue to this day.<ref name=Ernst-eval/> ''Objective Straight'' chiropractors, who are an offshoot of straights, only focus on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations while traditional straights claim that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases.<ref name=F.A.C.E.-position-paper1>{{cite web |url=http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm |title=Position Paper One&nbsp;\u2013 What is Objective Straight Chiropractic? |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=Foundation for the Advancement of Chiropractic Education (F.A.C.E.) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412203850/http://www.f-a-c-e.com/positionpaper1.htm |archivedate=2008-04-12 }}</ref> ''Reform'' chiropractors are an [[evidence-based]] offshoot of mixers who reject traditional Palmer philosophy and tend not to use [[alternative medicine]] methods.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mirtz TA, Long P, Dinehart A, etal |title=NACM and its argument with mainstream chiropractic health care |journal=J Controv Med Claims |year=2002 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=11\u201318 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25525357_ITM}} See: [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]]</ref> From 1984 to about 2008, some of them were organized as the [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]], an organization which met strong opposition from the profession and finally ceased to exist.<!-- See [[National Association for Chiropractic Medicine]] for details and references. -->\n\n==Debate==\nThere is continued disagreement over what \"innate\" and \"subluxation\" mean to chiropractic.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Arch Intern Med |year=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215\u201324 |title= Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |vauthors=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215}}</ref> Some chiropractors believe in [[Innate Intelligence]], a faith-based, unscientific belief which has been a source of derision for chiropractors.<ref name=\"Keating2002\">{{cite journal | title = The Meanings of Innate | journal = Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association | date = March 2002 | first = Joseph C. | last = Keating | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 4\u201310| pmc=2505097}}</ref> Chiropractors historically were strongly [[vaccine hesitancy|opposed to vaccination]] based on their belief that all diseases were traceable to causes in the spine, and therefore could not be affected by vaccines; D.D.

The AMA labeled chiropractic an \"unscientific [[cult]]\" in 1966,<ref name=\"Chiro-PH\"/> and until 1980 held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with \"unscientific practitioners\".<ref>{{cite journal |journal= [[Am J Public Health]] |year=1989 |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=1569\u201370 |title= AMA policy on chiropractic |author= Cherkin D |pmid=2817179 |pmc=1349822 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.79.11.1569-a}}</ref> In 1975, an anonymous AMA insider describing himself as a disgruntled AMA staffer and identifying himself as \"Sore Throat\" released information concerning the Committee on Quackery and its proposed methods to eliminate chiropractic to the press.<ref name=\"Sore Throat\">Robbins J (1996), Medical monopoly: the game nobody wins - excerpt from 'Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing', ''Vegetarian Times'' [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n230/ai_18696325/pg_3 available online]</ref> These papers were the basis of [[Wilk v.

American Medical Ass'n, 671&nbsp;F. Supp. 1465, N.D. Ill. 1987).<ref name=History-Primer/>\n\n== The movement toward scientific reform ==\n\nResearch to test chiropractic theories began in 1935 with the B.J. Palmer Research Clinic at the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. The clinic was organized into two divisions&nbsp;\u2013 a medical division and a chiropractic division. The medical division contained all the standard medical tests of the time and was used to establish a medical diagnosis of a patient's condition before the patient received treatment. The chiropractic division administered the treatment which included passive therapies, chiropractic adjustments and physical rehabilitation for the various conditions diagnosed. Research continued in the B.J. Palmer research clinic until B.J. Palmer's death in 1961 and the results and findings of these patient cases were the substance of B.J. Palmer's publishing over this 30 year time-period.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chiropractic: An Illustrated History|year=1995|publisher=Elsevier - Health Sciences Division|location=St Louis/US|isbn=978-0-8016-7735-9|pages=170\u201371|author1=Dennis Peterson |author2=Glenda Wiese }}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1950s, healthcare in the US had been transformed: the discovery of penicillin and development of the polio vaccine was restoring hope to millions, and the homeopathic physician had all but vanished as a result of \"antiquackery\" efforts of the medical trust and leadership efforts of the AMA. B.J. reduced the adjustment to HIO (Hole In One&nbsp;\u2013 the adjustment of only the atlas), while mixers continued to add and refine new proprietary techniques to find and reduce subluxations and improve health. Osteopathy in the US developed in parallel to medicine and dropped its reliance on spinal manipulation to treat illness. A similar reform movement began within chiropractic: shortly after the death of B.J. in 1961, a second generation chiropractor, Samuel Homola, wrote extensively on the subject of limiting the use of spinal manipulation, proposing that chiropractic as a medical specialty should focus on conservative care of musculoskeletal conditions.<ref name=\"Homola Chiros as EBM\">Homola S (2006), [http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf Can Chiropractors and Evidence-Based Manual Therapists Work Together?

As the group made their way forward, they were met by an intense barrage of enemy hand grenades, which forced them to take cover and abandon their mission.\n\nWhile returning to the rear, the stretcher party observed two men approaching them who they believed were fellow Marines.

Kraus unhesitatingly hurled himself on top of the grenade and absorbed the blast, saving the lives of his three comrades.\n\nKraus had been overseas for three months at the time of the Peleliu battle, which was his first campaign.
