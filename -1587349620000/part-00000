That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref>loaned out on Winter.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref> Loaned out</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref>Transfered In </ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=GK}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |In\n|-\n! width=3% |Pos.\n! width=33% |Name\n! width=28% |from\n! width=36% |Type\n|-\n|GK ||[[Gianluca Berti]] ||Empoli ||\n|-\n|GK ||Paolo Comi ||Monza ||\n|-\n|DF ||[[Michele Ferri]] ||[[A.C.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref>loaned out on Winter.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref> Loaned out</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref>Transfered In </ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=GK}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |In\n|-\n! width=3% |Pos.\n! width=33% |Name\n! width=28% |from\n! width=36% |Type\n|-\n|GK ||[[Gianluca Berti]] ||Empoli ||\n|-\n|GK ||Paolo Comi ||Monza ||\n|-\n|DF ||[[Michele Ferri]] ||[[A.C.

It is part of the [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nPicture Rocks is the birthplace of [[Warren Sprout]], who won a gold medal at the Olympics.\n\n==History==\nPicture Rocks was incorporated as a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] on September 27, 1875 from [[Wolf Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Wolf Township]], but its history began a century earlier.  The earliest settlers, who arrived in 1773, observed Indian [[pictograph]]s (no longer extant) in the [[Muncy Creek]] valley, and the borough occupies the site of a [[Munsee]] Indian village. Evidence of this is found in the arrowheads and other relics that have been found in the vicinity of the creek.\n\n[[File:Picture Rocks, Pennyslvania 2.jpg|thumb|left|The borough hall in Picture Rocks]]\nThe first [[warrant (law)|warrant]] for property in the Picture Rocks area was issued by the [[Province of Pennsylvania]] to Henry Rody on June 3, 1773. The land was used very little and passed through several hands until 1848 when it was sold to A. R. Sprout and Amos Burrows who went on to become the founding fathers of Picture Rocks. Sprout and Burrows worked to clear the land that was thought to be worthless of the rocks, logs and brush that covered it. They also rebuilt an abandoned [[sawmill]] and established a factory that manufactured sashes, doors, and window blinds. This factory, the first of its kind in the area, caused a stir among the local [[carpenter]]s who believed that the ready made building materials would curtail their profitability.  The original factory was later used by the Burrows Brothers Furniture Company before becoming the Handle and Excelsior Company.  Another factory, located at the present intersection of [[U.S. Route 220]] and Factory Street, manufactured ladders.\n\nThe town grew up around the factory and soon other manufacturers arrived to harness the [[water power]] provided by Muncy Creek. People interested in purchasing [[land lot|lots]] in Picture Rocks were required to sign an agreement stating that they would not open a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] or engage in the trafficking of [[liquor]]. This law was made by the residents and founders of the town, a majority of them being [[Baptists]].\n\nThe Baptists of Picture Rocks organized in 1840 and met for a while in a school house. A traveling preacher arrived in Picture Rocks one Saturday evening and found the school to be unfit for Sunday gatherings. After preaching on the following morning, he rallied the members of the congregation around the cause of building a proper house of worship. Under the guidance of their new pastor, the members of the Baptist Church built a log church building that was used until its replacement twenty-five years later by a larger facility.\n\nAt the time of the borough's creation, Center Street was considered the main street for travelers.  The original homes built by the Burrows and Sprout families still exist along Center Street and are easy to identify based upon their square shape with low pitched roof often with a widow's peak or lookout.\n\nBorough resident John Wesley Little achieved regional fame for his watercolor landscapes and images of rural farms and animals.  His studio/home is located along Water Street.  His original paintings are highly sought after at local auctions.\n\nThe borough boasts two churches, the Baptist Church on Elm Street and the Methodist Church on Laurel Street.\n\nLocated within the East Lycoming School District, Picture Rocks is home to George A. Ferrell Elementary School.  This K-6 elementary school is recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School.  The school was originally a fully inclusive school for students in first through twelfth grades with its own sports program.  The school joined with others in neighboring Hughesville and nearby Lairdsville to form the East Lycoming School District.\n\n==Geography==\nPicture Rocks is located at {{coord|41|16|48|N|76|42|42|W|type:city}} (41.280066, -76.711731),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in southeastern Lycoming County.

After preaching on the following morning, he rallied the members of the congregation around the cause of building a proper house of worship. Under the guidance of their new pastor, the members of the Baptist Church built a log church building that was used until its replacement twenty-five years later by a larger facility.\n\nAt the time of the borough's creation, Center Street was considered the main street for travelers.  The original homes built by the Burrows and Sprout families still exist along Center Street and are easy to identify based upon their square shape with low pitched roof often with a widow's peak or lookout.\n\nBorough resident John Wesley Little achieved regional fame for his watercolor landscapes and images of rural farms and animals.  His studio/home is located along Water Street.  His original paintings are highly sought after at local auctions.\n\nThe borough boasts two churches, the Baptist Church on Elm Street and the Methodist Church on Laurel Street.\n\nLocated within the East Lycoming School District, Picture Rocks is home to George A. Ferrell Elementary School.  This K-6 elementary school is recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School.  The school was originally a fully inclusive school for students in first through twelfth grades with its own sports program.  The school joined with others in neighboring Hughesville and nearby Lairdsville to form the East Lycoming School District.\n\n==Geography==\nPicture Rocks is located at {{coord|41|16|48|N|76|42|42|W|type:city}} (41.280066, -76.711731),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> in southeastern Lycoming County.

In the defter of 1497 they appear as ''katun Bushat'' in Piperi with 35 households.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\">{{cite journal |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Kontribut p\u00ebr studimin e ngulitjes s\u00eb katuneve dhe krijimin e fiseve n\u00eb Shqipe \u0308rine \u0308 e veriut shekujt XV-XVI' [Contribution to the Study of Village Settlements and the Formation of the Tribes of Northern Albania in the 15th century] |journal=Studime Historike |date=1975 |volume=12 |page=87-89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4khAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha2}}</ref>\n\nThe Bushati family traces their origin the Begaj brotherhood of Bushati that had converted to Islam possibly in the early 17th century. To promote their status and political goals statesmen, commanders and leaders from that family put forward different theories about their origins. [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] in his time recorded a story about them being descendants of a Jusuf Bey Plaku, who traced his origin and status to the era of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. In the period of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] sought to expand northwards in the old lands of [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] of the Middle Ages. In order to legitimize and strengthen his claim, he put forward another theory that he descended from [[Skenderbeg Crnojevi\u0107]], Ivan's Muslim son.<ref name=\"Slijep\u010devi\u01071983\">{{cite book|author=\u0110oko M.
