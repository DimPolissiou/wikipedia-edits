Founded in 1893, they are nicknamed \"The Dark Blues\" or \"The Dee\". The club plays its home matches at [[Dens Park]].\n\nThe club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of [[Bob Shankly]], Dundee won the [[Scottish Football League]] title in [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1962]], before reaching the semi-finals of the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]]. Dundee has won the [[Scottish Cup]] once, and won the [[Scottish League Cup]] three times.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of Dundee F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\n\nDundee F.C. was formed in 1893 by the merger of two local clubs, [[Dundee East End F.C.|East End]] and [[Dundee Our Boys F.C.|Our Boys]], with the intention of gaining election to the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL). Their application was successful and they played their first League game on 12 August 1893 at [[West Craigie Park]], securing a 3\u20133 draw against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Dundee struggled during the first 10 years of their existence. Their best league position was fifth which they achieved in seasons 1895\u201396 and 1896\u201397. They also reached the semi-finals of the [[Scottish Cup]] in 1894\u201395 and 1897\u201398, losing to [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] respectively. On 26 October 1895 Dundee lost a league game by a record score of 0\u201311 to [[History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)|Celtic]] in Glasgow. On 1 January 1894 Dundee defeated [[Newton Heath F.C.|Newton Heath]] (the future Manchester United) 2\u20131 at their then [[Carolina Port]] ground in Dundee. Carolina Port also hosted the first international football match held in Dundee on [[1895-96 British Home Championship|21 March 1896]] when Scotland defeated Wales 4\u20130. Dundee's goalkeeper [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Frank Barrett]], midfielder [[List of Scotland international footballers (5\u201324 caps)|Sandy Keillor]] and inside-forward [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Bill Thomson]] were all capped for Scotland during this early period of the club's history. Things began to improve for Dundee with the beginning of the new century. In 1899 they moved from Carolina Port to their present ground of [[Dens Park]]. In season [[1902\u201303 in Scottish football|1902\u201303]] they finished runners-up in the league championship to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. (In season 1902\u201303 Dundee allowed 12 league goals against, which remains the fewest goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.)\n\nDundee were also league runners-up in 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|1908\u201309]] by just 1 point. In the 10 seasons from 1902 to 1903 Dundee lost just 16 league games at Dens Park out of 154 played and were unbeaten at home during season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]]. Although ultimate success eluded Dundee in the league the club achieved success in the Scottish Cup. In season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]] Dundee won their first trophy by defeating Clyde in the [[1909\u201310 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup Final]]. (Dundee took three games to beat [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the semi-final and then the same number to defeat [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]].) The winning goal in the second replay was scored by [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John 'Sailor' Hunter]]. In season [[1910\u201311 Scottish Cup|1910\u201311]] Dundee defeated [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20131 at Dens Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-final but lost to [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]] in the semi-final. The beginning of the First World War and the call-up of many players for military duty drastically curtailed football in Britain from 1914 and in [[List of Dundee F.C. seasons|1917]] Dundee and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] were both asked to withdraw from the league due to increasing transport costs for the other league clubs. In 1919 league football recommenced and good home form once again propelled Dundee up the league. They finished 4th in seasons [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201320]], [[1920\u201321 in Scottish football|1920\u201321]] and [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322]], and were unbeaten at home during season 1921\u201322. However, they could not make the breakthrough to win the league championship.\n\n[[Dave Halliday]] had played on the left wing for his previous clubs, his hometown side [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. Halliday went to Dundee in 1921 where Scotland internationalist Alec Troup played left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to [[centre forward]] with prolific results; he finished as Scottish top scorer in the [[1923\u201324 in Scottish football|1923\u201324 season]] with 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances. This remains the club record all-time seasonal league goal scoring record. Halliday top scored in England's top division in 1928-29 to become the most recent of only 2 players to be outright top scorer in Scotland and England. With Halliday Dundee reached the [[1924\u201325 Scottish Cup]] final eliminating the holders en route, the [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] side of [[Hughie Gallacher]]. Dundee led [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 1-0 at half time in the final before losing out to a last minute [[Jimmy McGrory]] winner. Halliday top scored for Dundee in that cup run. In end of season tours with Dundee, Halliday scored doubles against each of [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. Halliday scored 103 goals in 147 league and cup appearances for the Dee. He then moved South to set scoring records in England where other teams profited from Dundee's decision to convert Halliday to centre-forward.<ref name=qoslegend>[http://www.qosfc.com/legend-1048 Dave Halliday full career profile on www.qosfc.com]</ref>\n\n===Mid 20th century===\n\n[[File:Dundee FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Dundee in the Scottish League.]]The post-Second World War period was a golden era for Dundee Football Club. Having been relegated on the eve of war, the Dark Blues started in 1946 in the first official season in the second tier but within five years they were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and won their first trophy in forty-one years.\n\nBack to back 'B\u2019 Division titles earned George Anderson's Dundee promotion in 1947 and just two years later they were within a whisker of becoming Champions of Scotland. Silverware was not far away however as after spending a world record transfer fee of \u00a323,500 on [[Billy Steel]], much to the chagrin of modern-day supporters of the club \u2013 at least some anyway \u2013 who resented the aspect of finance in football and wish instead for 'homegrown' talent, they won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 in one of the most exciting finals Hampden has ever seen.\n\nTwelve months later Dundee were back at Hampden to become the first side to retain the League Cup and in between these two victories appeared in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The Dark Blue side of the era included players such as Bill Brown, Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie, Alfie Boyd, Bobby Flavell and Billy Steel.\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 Scottish Cup]] Dundee suffered a shock 1\u20130 defeat to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Fraserburgh F.C.|Fraserburgh]]. This is widely regarded as Dundee's most embarrassing defeat in their history.\n\n===1960s \u2013 Dundee's golden age===\n\n[[Bob Shankly]] (brother of [[Bill Shankly]]) was appointed manager in 1959. Dundee won the league title of Scotland's top division, then called the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], in the [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1961\u201362 season]]. With players such as Bobby Cox, Bobby Wishart, Pat Liney (Goalkeeper), Alan Cousin, Andy Penman, Hugh Robertson, [[Alan Gilzean]], [[Alex Hamilton (footballer born 1936)|Alex Hamilton]], [[Bobby Seith]], [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Ian Ure]] they clinched the title with a win against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], which in turn relegated St Johnstone to the then Second Division. Gordon Smith earned the distinction of being the only player to win the Scottish football championship with three clubs ([[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and Dundee), none of them either half of the traditionally dominant [[Old Firm]].<ref name = \"ancell\">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=976|title=QosFC: Bobby Ancell|website=qosfc.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1962\u201363 in Scottish football|following season]], 1962\u201363, Dundee reached the [[European Cup 1962\u201363#Semi finals|semi-finals]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] beating [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]. Dundee lost to [[A.C. Milan]] on aggregate in the semi-finals; though Dundee won (and kept a clean sheet) against Milan in the home leg at Dens Park. \n\nThe Dee reached the Scottish Cup final again in the [[1963\u201364 Scottish Cup|1963\u201364 competition]]. Shankly left Dundee in February 1965.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\nThe next manager after Shankly was former player [[Bobby Ancell]] from the 1947 B Division Championship side. Ancell took Dundee to a 1967\u201368 League Cup final against the previous season's European Cup winners, Celtic. Ancell's team scored three times at [[Hampden Park]] in Celtic's native [[Glasgow]] but still lost 5\u20133. \n\nIn the predecessor to the [[UEFA Cup]]/[[Europa League]], Dundee reached the semi-finals of the [[1967\u201368 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. Dundee eliminated opposition from the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland to meet [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-final. After a 1\u20131 draw at Dens, a 1\u20130 second leg win took Leeds through.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\nIn 1973 under the management of [[David White (football manager)|David White]] and captaincy of [[Tommy Gemmell]], the [[League Cup]] returned to Dens following a 1\u20130 win against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2000 the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Claudio Caniggia]],<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia fever puts Dundee in world spotlight\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/caniggia-fever-puts-dundee-in-world-spotlight-628967.html\n| newspaper  = [[The Independent|Independent]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London\n| first=Calum\n| last=Philip}}</ref> who later signed for Rangers.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia to join Rangers\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/15/newsstory.sport4\n| work  = [[The Guardian]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London}}</ref> Caniggia was only one of many foreign signings in the Dundee side in the early 2000s, which also included former [[Newcastle United]] player [[Temuri Ketsbaia]].<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Ketsbaia heads north to Dundee\n |url          = http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |work    = [[The Guardian]]\n |date         = 18 October 2001\n |accessdate   = 24 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120331125915/http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |archive-date = 31 March 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The signing of such high-profile players along with many others led Dundee to a Scottish Cup final and two top-six finishes. This was achieved under the managership of [[Ivano Bonetti]], who also made a short but notable contribution on the park linking up well with Caniggia. Attendances were still short of the hoped for numbers and with spending significantly outweighing income, Dundee were soon forced into administration.\n\nBefore Dundee went into financial trouble they knocked out Glasgow side [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] 2\u20130 away from home in the third round of the [[Scottish Cup]]. The fourth round saw Dundee knock out [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 2\u20130 at [[Dens Park]]. Dundee continued their march towards [[Hampden Park]] with a 1\u20131 draw away and a 4\u20131 extra time victory over [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at Dens booked their place in the semi-finals playing [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] at [[Hampden Park]]. A goal by [[Georgi Nemsadze]] secured a 1\u20130 victory and a place in [[2003 Scottish Cup Final|the Final]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In the final [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] hit the post for Dundee but [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] scored to bring Dundee's cup run to an end.\n\nIn 2003, due to the club's failure to sell on players as anticipated insufficient income was raised to fund the large wage bill under owners Peter and James Marr, resulting in a \u00a323m debt which meant they were forced to go into administration with many players such as [[Fabian Caballero]], [[Craig Burley]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgian]] captain [[Giorgi Nemsadze]] leaving in 2005. Despite this huge debt, Dundee survived by selling their stadium in 2003. But the club was then relegated to the second tier of the Scottish leagues, where they remained until July 2012. In mid-2006, it was announced that financial restructuring would see the club become debt-free.\n\nIn 2007, James and Peter Marr severed some of their ties with Dundee, stepping down as chairman and Chief Executive respectively, when their company P&J Taverns was forced into administration. Bob Brannan and [[Dave MacKinnon (footballer)|Dave MacKinnon]] took the Marrs' place.\n\nIn 2008, after a poor run in the league, manager [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]] was sacked, with former manager [[Jocky Scott]] taking over for his third stint with the club.<ref name=\"Scott1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/7695798.stm|title=Scott set for Dundee appointment|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 October 2008 | date=30 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dundee FC.svg|thumb|centre|Logo used from 1987 to 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundee|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Dundee/Dundee.htm|work=Historical Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>]]\nIn the 2009\u201310 season Dundee director Calum Melville was in trouble for claiming he was going to offer rivals [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] \u00a3500,000 for ex-Dundee midfielder [[Scott Robertson (footballer born 1985)|Scott Robertson]].<ref name=\"Scott2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/dundee-director-calum-melville-faces-grilling-over-planned-bid-for-dundee-united-s-scott-robertson-1.928974|title=Melville faces grilling for planned bid|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|accessdate=28 October 2009 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> Dundee won the [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final]] when they beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/cups/challenge-cup/2009/11/23/alba-cup-final-inverness-caledonian-thistle-2-dundee-3-86908-21842989/|title=Alba Cup Final: Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2 Dundee 3|date=23 November 2009|work=DailyRecord|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Scott was sacked as manager after a 3\u20130 defeat by [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/8578476.stm|title=First Division leaders Dundee sack manager Jocky Scott|work=BBC Sport|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=20 March 2010 | first=Jim | last=Spence}}</ref> He was replaced by Gordon Chisholm, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.\n\nIn September 2010, Dundee were again on the brink of going into administration due to a \u00a3365,000 unpaid tax bill.

On 10 December 2010 the Dark Blues Business Trust was set up by former Dundee owner Peter Marr and former director Steve Martin to help the club recover from their financial situation. On 17 December 2010 Dundee's appeal against the points deduction was rejected. Dundee went on a 23 match undefeated streak in the first division beating the previous record set by the team.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, Dundee FC exited administration.

These targets were set to ensure, in some part, that the failures that led to administration and indeed, several decades of financial turmoil, could not be repeated. Dundee were left after the second administration with only [[Administration (British football)|footballing debt]] and no borrowing capability. Since exiting administration, the club has focussed on honouring the footballing debt, whilst keeping lower football wages and stadium bills, according to the income generated. The debt post-admin was unexpectedly still over \u00a3200,000 which had to be quickly worked into the board's already stretched budgets.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful season in the Premier League, when they were asked to replace [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], Dundee were again relegated after finishing bottom, despite vastly improved form after [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] replaced [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] as manager toward the end of the season. The following season (2013\u201314) Dundee would take part in the [[Scottish Championship]] (formerly the First Division) after reforms were made to the Scottish League system.\n\nThroughout the summer leading up to the start of the 2013\u201314 season talks were held regarding a possible Texan based takeover with investments to be made of up to \u00a3650,000. The takeover was completed and former Director Bill Colvin was appointed as chairman to oversee this new board of which main investor Tim Keyes of Keyes Capital, Austin, Texas, appointed John Nelms to look after his interests. The 2013\u201314 season proved to be one to remember with Dundee clinching the title and promotion to the top tier on the last day of the season with a 2\u20131 win over [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. After a heavy defeat to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and a draw against Alloa, manager [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] was replaced by [[Paul Hartley]]. A 3\u20130 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4\u20131 loss to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] for Hamilton Academical meant that Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale. [[Dens Park]] was sold out for the game against [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] when [[Christian Nade]] headed in the opening goal. Soon after, [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] scored the second goal. The away side pulled a goal back in the second half and [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] managed to close the goal difference with a 10\u20132 victory over [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. But Dundee got the three points, and clinched promotion to the [[Scottish Premiership]].\n\n===Return to the Premiership===\n\nPaul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed [[Greg Stewart (footballer)|Greg Stewart]] on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and [[Philip Roberts]] who joined before the end of May. Released [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] players [[James McPake]] and [[Kevin Thomson]] were next to join, along with [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa]] goalkeeper [[Scott Bain]]. Thomson was made Captain after signing. [[Simon Ferry]], released from Portsmouth then returned to his hometown to play for Dundee. [[Paul McGowan (footballer)|Paul McGowan]] and [[Paul McGinn]] arrived from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and Dumbarton respectfully, then attacking midfielder [[Gary Harkins]] signed for his third spell at the club on the last day of June, after also being released from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. A number of first team players departed, namely [[Christian Nade]] and [[Ryan Conroy]], who both went on to join [[raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Gavin Rae]] who retired from playing and player-coach [[Matt Lockwood]].\n\nOn the opening day of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]], Dundee recorded a 1\u20131 draw against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at home, [[Gary Harkins]] put Dundee ahead from the spot after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] conceded a penalty, with [[Craig Slater]] equalising for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]] on 23 August with a 1\u20130 win over [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] away from home, a 79th-minute goal from [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season. Dundee also started the League Cup well with two 4\u20130 wins on the bounce over [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]].\n\nDundee managed to gain a top six place by mid-April thus securing their position in the Premiership for 2015\u201316 campaign. They secured the place for definite after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] were defeated 2\u20131 by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] on 12 April and a Dundee derby victory on 8 April in a 3\u20131 Win at home to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32089189|title=Kilmarnock 1\u20132 Aberdeen|date=12 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref> \n\nAt the end of the 2014\u201315 season, in June, Dundee chairman Bill Colvin stepped down as chairman and sold his share in Dundee to then director, Tim Keyes who became the new chairman of the club.<ref name=\"eveningtelegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/|title=Evening Telegraph \u2013 The latest news and sport from Dundee, Tayside and Fife|website=Evening Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDundee finished 8th in the [[2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership]], notably relegating rivals [[Dundee United]] at Dens Park.\n\nDundee were relegated to the Scottish Championship at the end of the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership|2018\u201319 season]].

Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as [[Tannadice Park]], which is the home of city rivals Dundee United.\n\nIn 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland's bid to host the [[2008 European Football Championship]]. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Stadium respectively.  However, when [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]] were selected to co-host the event, the plans were shelved for the immediate future.\n\nIn May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett who, despite having invested heavily in Dundee, had rejoined the Dundee United board, where he had previously been a director until September 2008.\n\nIn October 2014, Dundee Supporter's Society announced they had put forward plans to then club chairman, Bill Colvin which would allow the club to buy back the stadium from current owner John Bennett. They also expressed this was not a plan to enable the Supporter's Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, and that they will \"simply administer the scheme\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dee4life.com/news/47/chairmans-update-october.html|title=Chairmans Update October|last=mtc.|website=dee4life.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Colvin announced that negotiations were taking place to buy back the Stadium from current owner John Bennett and his company Sandeman Holdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32240533|title=Dundee negotiate to buy back Dens Park stadium|date=9 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, club owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms were reported to have bought land in the Camperdown area of Dundee, next to the city's Ice Arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/exclusive-dundee-leave-dens-1-2m-land-deal1/|title=Dee could be set for new home as duo buy \u00a31.2m land \u2013 Evening Telegraph}}</ref> It was then made clear in February 2017 that the plan for this land was to develop a new stadium for the club due to the increasing maintenance costs of Dens Park, although plans for a move were described by Nelms as being \"early doors\" in a video interview published on the club's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/dundee-fc/378762/dundee-fc-press-plans-leave-dens-park/|title=Dundee FC press on with plans to leave Dens Park \u2013 The Courier}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed '''Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park''' for sponsorship reasons for the next two seasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44304571 |title=Dundee: Home ground renamed the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park |work=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Club staff==\n\n===Corporate board===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The rivalry is unique, as the two teams' stadiums are located within 100 yards of each other. The close proximity of the two teams also fuels the intensity of the rivalry. This intensity makes it one of the most exciting and notable derbies in Scotland. While it is far friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the [[Old Firm]], both sets of fans regard the fixture to be of high importance, with derby results throughout the season being defining points in each teams' seasons.\n\nDundee traditionally dominated the fixture in its first few decades, but the momentum shifted in the 1980s, with United taking a foothold in the fixture. The history of late has been defined by the inability of both teams to consistently stay in the same division, with Dundee a division below United for quite a few seasons while dealing with the after-effects of multiple administrations. Dundee eventually returned to the [[Scottish Premiership]] in 2014, and in 2016 it was a Dundee derby victory over United that confirmed the latter's own relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36126882|title=Dundee 2\u20131 Dundee United|last=English|first=Tom|date=2 May 2016|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> After a few years of Dundee being a league above United, the two were eventually reunited again in the [[Scottish Championship]] in 2019 following Dundee's relegation.\n\nDundee and United also share a mutual rivalry with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], due to the close proximity between [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], known as the [[Tayside derby]]. This fixture however is considered far less serious than the Dundee derby, though took prominence after United's relegation in 2016. The most notable fixture between the two occurred in 1962, where Dundee defeated St Johnstone 0\u20133 at the latter's former ground, [[Muirton Park]]. This result both confirmed Dundee as league champions for the first and to date only time in their history, and confirmed St Johnstone's relegation from the First Division.\n==Records==\n* '''Highest attendance:''' 136,495 fans attended the [[1952 Scottish Cup Final]] between Dundee and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

Tannadice Park, Dundee, Scotland, October 2010.jpg|thumb|Map showing the proximity of Dundee FC's stadium Dens Park (left) and Dundee United FC's stadium [[Tannadice Park]] (right)]]\n\n'''Dundee Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club based in the city of [[Dundee]], Scotland. Founded in 1893, they are nicknamed \"The Dark Blues\" or \"The Dee\". The club plays its home matches at [[Dens Park]].\n\nThe club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of [[Bob Shankly]], Dundee won the [[Scottish Football League]] title in [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1962]], before reaching the semi-finals of the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]]. Dundee has won the [[Scottish Cup]] once, and won the [[Scottish League Cup]] three times.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of Dundee F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\n\nDundee F.C. was formed in 1893 by the merger of two local clubs, [[Dundee East End F.C.|East End]] and [[Dundee Our Boys F.C.|Our Boys]], with the intention of gaining election to the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL). Their application was successful and they played their first League game on 12 August 1893 at [[West Craigie Park]], securing a 3\u20133 draw against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Dundee struggled during the first 10 years of their existence. Their best league position was fifth which they achieved in seasons 1895\u201396 and 1896\u201397. They also reached the semi-finals of the [[Scottish Cup]] in 1894\u201395 and 1897\u201398, losing to [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] respectively. On 26 October 1895 Dundee lost a league game by a record score of 0\u201311 to [[History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)|Celtic]] in Glasgow. On 1 January 1894 Dundee defeated [[Newton Heath F.C.|Newton Heath]] (the future Manchester United) 2\u20131 at their then [[Carolina Port]] ground in Dundee. Carolina Port also hosted the first international football match held in Dundee on [[1895-96 British Home Championship|21 March 1896]] when Scotland defeated Wales 4\u20130. Dundee's goalkeeper [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Frank Barrett]], midfielder [[List of Scotland international footballers (5\u201324 caps)|Sandy Keillor]] and inside-forward [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Bill Thomson]] were all capped for Scotland during this early period of the club's history. Things began to improve for Dundee with the beginning of the new century. In 1899 they moved from Carolina Port to their present ground of [[Dens Park]]. In season [[1902\u201303 in Scottish football|1902\u201303]] they finished runners-up in the league championship to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. (In season 1902\u201303 Dundee allowed 12 league goals against, which remains the fewest goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.)\n\nDundee were also league runners-up in 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|1908\u201309]] by just 1 point. In the 10 seasons from 1902 to 1903 Dundee lost just 16 league games at Dens Park out of 154 played and were unbeaten at home during season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]]. Although ultimate success eluded Dundee in the league the club achieved success in the Scottish Cup. In season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]] Dundee won their first trophy by defeating Clyde in the [[1909\u201310 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup Final]]. (Dundee took three games to beat [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the semi-final and then the same number to defeat [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]].) The winning goal in the second replay was scored by [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John 'Sailor' Hunter]]. In season [[1910\u201311 Scottish Cup|1910\u201311]] Dundee defeated [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20131 at Dens Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-final but lost to [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]] in the semi-final. The beginning of the First World War and the call-up of many players for military duty drastically curtailed football in Britain from 1914 and in [[List of Dundee F.C. seasons|1917]] Dundee and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] were both asked to withdraw from the league due to increasing transport costs for the other league clubs. In 1919 league football recommenced and good home form once again propelled Dundee up the league. They finished 4th in seasons [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201320]], [[1920\u201321 in Scottish football|1920\u201321]] and [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322]], and were unbeaten at home during season 1921\u201322. However, they could not make the breakthrough to win the league championship.\n\n[[Dave Halliday]] had played on the left wing for his previous clubs, his hometown side [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. Halliday went to Dundee in 1921 where Scotland internationalist Alec Troup played left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to [[centre forward]] with prolific results; he finished as Scottish top scorer in the [[1923\u201324 in Scottish football|1923\u201324 season]] with 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances. This remains the club record all-time seasonal league goal scoring record. Halliday top scored in England's top division in 1928-29 to become the most recent of only 2 players to be outright top scorer in Scotland and England. With Halliday Dundee reached the [[1924\u201325 Scottish Cup]] final eliminating the holders en route, the [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] side of [[Hughie Gallacher]]. Dundee led [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 1-0 at half time in the final before losing out to a last minute [[Jimmy McGrory]] winner. Halliday top scored for Dundee in that cup run. In end of season tours with Dundee, Halliday scored doubles against each of [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. Halliday scored 103 goals in 147 league and cup appearances for the Dee. He then moved South to set scoring records in England where other teams profited from Dundee's decision to convert Halliday to centre-forward.<ref name=qoslegend>[http://www.qosfc.com/legend-1048 Dave Halliday full career profile on www.qosfc.com]</ref>\n\n===Mid 20th century===\n\n[[File:Dundee FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Dundee in the Scottish League.]]The post-Second World War period was a golden era for Dundee Football Club. Having been relegated on the eve of war, the Dark Blues started in 1946 in the first official season in the second tier but within five years they were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and won their first trophy in forty-one years.\n\nBack to back 'B\u2019 Division titles earned George Anderson's Dundee promotion in 1947 and just two years later they were within a whisker of becoming Champions of Scotland. Silverware was not far away however as after spending a world record transfer fee of \u00a323,500 on [[Billy Steel]], much to the chagrin of modern-day supporters of the club \u2013 at least some anyway \u2013 who resented the aspect of finance in football and wish instead for 'homegrown' talent, they won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 in one of the most exciting finals Hampden has ever seen.\n\nTwelve months later Dundee were back at Hampden to become the first side to retain the League Cup and in between these two victories appeared in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The Dark Blue side of the era included players such as Bill Brown, Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie, Alfie Boyd, Bobby Flavell and Billy Steel.\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 Scottish Cup]] Dundee suffered a shock 1\u20130 defeat to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Fraserburgh F.C.|Fraserburgh]]. This is widely regarded as Dundee's most embarrassing defeat in their history.\n\n===1960s \u2013 Dundee's golden age===\n\n[[Bob Shankly]] (brother of [[Bill Shankly]]) was appointed manager in 1959. Dundee won the league title of Scotland's top division, then called the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], in the [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1961\u201362 season]]. With players such as Bobby Cox, Bobby Wishart, Pat Liney (Goalkeeper), Alan Cousin, Andy Penman, Hugh Robertson, [[Alan Gilzean]], [[Alex Hamilton (footballer born 1936)|Alex Hamilton]], [[Bobby Seith]], [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Ian Ure]] they clinched the title with a win against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], which in turn relegated St Johnstone to the then Second Division. Gordon Smith earned the distinction of being the only player to win the Scottish football championship with three clubs ([[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and Dundee), none of them either half of the traditionally dominant [[Old Firm]].<ref name = \"ancell\">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=976|title=QosFC: Bobby Ancell|website=qosfc.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1962\u201363 in Scottish football|following season]], 1962\u201363, Dundee reached the [[European Cup 1962\u201363#Semi finals|semi-finals]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] beating [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]. Dundee lost to [[A.C. Milan]] on aggregate in the semi-finals; though Dundee won (and kept a clean sheet) against Milan in the home leg at Dens Park. \n\nThe Dee reached the Scottish Cup final again in the [[1963\u201364 Scottish Cup|1963\u201364 competition]]. Shankly left Dundee in February 1965.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\nThe next manager after Shankly was former player [[Bobby Ancell]] from the 1947 B Division Championship side. Ancell took Dundee to a 1967\u201368 League Cup final against the previous season's European Cup winners, Celtic. Ancell's team scored three times at [[Hampden Park]] in Celtic's native [[Glasgow]] but still lost 5\u20133. \n\nIn the predecessor to the [[UEFA Cup]]/[[Europa League]], Dundee reached the semi-finals of the [[1967\u201368 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. Dundee eliminated opposition from the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland to meet [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-final. After a 1\u20131 draw at Dens, a 1\u20130 second leg win took Leeds through.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\nIn 1973 under the management of [[David White (football manager)|David White]] and captaincy of [[Tommy Gemmell]], the [[League Cup]] returned to Dens following a 1\u20130 win against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2000 the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Claudio Caniggia]],<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia fever puts Dundee in world spotlight\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/caniggia-fever-puts-dundee-in-world-spotlight-628967.html\n| newspaper  = [[The Independent|Independent]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London\n| first=Calum\n| last=Philip}}</ref> who later signed for Rangers.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia to join Rangers\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/15/newsstory.sport4\n| work  = [[The Guardian]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London}}</ref> Caniggia was only one of many foreign signings in the Dundee side in the early 2000s, which also included former [[Newcastle United]] player [[Temuri Ketsbaia]].<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Ketsbaia heads north to Dundee\n |url          = http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |work    = [[The Guardian]]\n |date         = 18 October 2001\n |accessdate   = 24 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120331125915/http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |archive-date = 31 March 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The signing of such high-profile players along with many others led Dundee to a Scottish Cup final and two top-six finishes. This was achieved under the managership of [[Ivano Bonetti]], who also made a short but notable contribution on the park linking up well with Caniggia. Attendances were still short of the hoped for numbers and with spending significantly outweighing income, Dundee were soon forced into administration.\n\nBefore Dundee went into financial trouble they knocked out Glasgow side [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] 2\u20130 away from home in the third round of the [[Scottish Cup]]. The fourth round saw Dundee knock out [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 2\u20130 at [[Dens Park]]. Dundee continued their march towards [[Hampden Park]] with a 1\u20131 draw away and a 4\u20131 extra time victory over [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at Dens booked their place in the semi-finals playing [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] at [[Hampden Park]]. A goal by [[Georgi Nemsadze]] secured a 1\u20130 victory and a place in [[2003 Scottish Cup Final|the Final]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In the final [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] hit the post for Dundee but [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] scored to bring Dundee's cup run to an end.\n\nIn 2003, due to the club's failure to sell on players as anticipated insufficient income was raised to fund the large wage bill under owners Peter and James Marr, resulting in a \u00a323m debt which meant they were forced to go into administration with many players such as [[Fabian Caballero]], [[Craig Burley]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgian]] captain [[Giorgi Nemsadze]] leaving in 2005. Despite this huge debt, Dundee survived by selling their stadium in 2003. But the club was then relegated to the second tier of the Scottish leagues, where they remained until July 2012. In mid-2006, it was announced that financial restructuring would see the club become debt-free.\n\nIn 2007, James and Peter Marr severed some of their ties with Dundee, stepping down as chairman and Chief Executive respectively, when their company P&J Taverns was forced into administration. Bob Brannan and [[Dave MacKinnon (footballer)|Dave MacKinnon]] took the Marrs' place.\n\nIn 2008, after a poor run in the league, manager [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]] was sacked, with former manager [[Jocky Scott]] taking over for his third stint with the club.<ref name=\"Scott1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/7695798.stm|title=Scott set for Dundee appointment|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 October 2008 | date=30 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dundee FC.svg|thumb|centre|Logo used from 1987 to 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundee|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Dundee/Dundee.htm|work=Historical Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>]]\nIn the 2009\u201310 season Dundee director Calum Melville was in trouble for claiming he was going to offer rivals [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] \u00a3500,000 for ex-Dundee midfielder [[Scott Robertson (footballer born 1985)|Scott Robertson]].<ref name=\"Scott2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/dundee-director-calum-melville-faces-grilling-over-planned-bid-for-dundee-united-s-scott-robertson-1.928974|title=Melville faces grilling for planned bid|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|accessdate=28 October 2009 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> Dundee won the [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final]] when they beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/cups/challenge-cup/2009/11/23/alba-cup-final-inverness-caledonian-thistle-2-dundee-3-86908-21842989/|title=Alba Cup Final: Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2 Dundee 3|date=23 November 2009|work=DailyRecord|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Scott was sacked as manager after a 3\u20130 defeat by [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/8578476.stm|title=First Division leaders Dundee sack manager Jocky Scott|work=BBC Sport|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=20 March 2010 | first=Jim | last=Spence}}</ref> He was replaced by Gordon Chisholm, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.\n\nIn September 2010, Dundee were again on the brink of going into administration due to a \u00a3365,000 unpaid tax bill.

On 10 December 2010 the Dark Blues Business Trust was set up by former Dundee owner Peter Marr and former director Steve Martin to help the club recover from their financial situation. On 17 December 2010 Dundee's appeal against the points deduction was rejected. Dundee went on a 23 match undefeated streak in the first division beating the previous record set by the team.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, Dundee FC exited administration.

These targets were set to ensure, in some part, that the failures that led to administration and indeed, several decades of financial turmoil, could not be repeated. Dundee were left after the second administration with only [[Administration (British football)|footballing debt]] and no borrowing capability. Since exiting administration, the club has focussed on honouring the footballing debt, whilst keeping lower football wages and stadium bills, according to the income generated. The debt post-admin was unexpectedly still over \u00a3200,000 which had to be quickly worked into the board's already stretched budgets.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful season in the Premier League, when they were asked to replace [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], Dundee were again relegated after finishing bottom, despite vastly improved form after [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] replaced [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] as manager toward the end of the season. The following season (2013\u201314) Dundee would take part in the [[Scottish Championship]] (formerly the First Division) after reforms were made to the Scottish League system.\n\nThroughout the summer leading up to the start of the 2013\u201314 season talks were held regarding a possible Texan based takeover with investments to be made of up to \u00a3650,000. The takeover was completed and former Director Bill Colvin was appointed as chairman to oversee this new board of which main investor Tim Keyes of Keyes Capital, Austin, Texas, appointed John Nelms to look after his interests. The 2013\u201314 season proved to be one to remember with Dundee clinching the title and promotion to the top tier on the last day of the season with a 2\u20131 win over [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. After a heavy defeat to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and a draw against Alloa, manager [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] was replaced by [[Paul Hartley]]. A 3\u20130 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4\u20131 loss to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] for Hamilton Academical meant that Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale. [[Dens Park]] was sold out for the game against [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] when [[Christian Nade]] headed in the opening goal. Soon after, [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] scored the second goal. The away side pulled a goal back in the second half and [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] managed to close the goal difference with a 10\u20132 victory over [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. But Dundee got the three points, and clinched promotion to the [[Scottish Premiership]].\n\n===Return to the Premiership===\n\nPaul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed [[Greg Stewart (footballer)|Greg Stewart]] on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and [[Philip Roberts]] who joined before the end of May. Released [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] players [[James McPake]] and [[Kevin Thomson]] were next to join, along with [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa]] goalkeeper [[Scott Bain]]. Thomson was made Captain after signing. [[Simon Ferry]], released from Portsmouth then returned to his hometown to play for Dundee. [[Paul McGowan (footballer)|Paul McGowan]] and [[Paul McGinn]] arrived from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and Dumbarton respectfully, then attacking midfielder [[Gary Harkins]] signed for his third spell at the club on the last day of June, after also being released from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. A number of first team players departed, namely [[Christian Nade]] and [[Ryan Conroy]], who both went on to join [[raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Gavin Rae]] who retired from playing and player-coach [[Matt Lockwood]].\n\nOn the opening day of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]], Dundee recorded a 1\u20131 draw against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at home, [[Gary Harkins]] put Dundee ahead from the spot after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] conceded a penalty, with [[Craig Slater]] equalising for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]] on 23 August with a 1\u20130 win over [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] away from home, a 79th-minute goal from [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season. Dundee also started the League Cup well with two 4\u20130 wins on the bounce over [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]].\n\nDundee managed to gain a top six place by mid-April thus securing their position in the Premiership for 2015\u201316 campaign. They secured the place for definite after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] were defeated 2\u20131 by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] on 12 April and a Dundee derby victory on 8 April in a 3\u20131 Win at home to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32089189|title=Kilmarnock 1\u20132 Aberdeen|date=12 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref> \n\nAt the end of the 2014\u201315 season, in June, Dundee chairman Bill Colvin stepped down as chairman and sold his share in Dundee to then director, Tim Keyes who became the new chairman of the club.<ref name=\"eveningtelegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/|title=Evening Telegraph \u2013 The latest news and sport from Dundee, Tayside and Fife|website=Evening Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDundee finished 8th in the [[2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership]], notably relegating rivals [[Dundee United]] at Dens Park.\n\nDundee were relegated to the Scottish Championship at the end of the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership|2018\u201319 season]].

Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as [[Tannadice Park]], which is the home of city rivals Dundee United.\n\nIn 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland's bid to host the [[2008 European Football Championship]]. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Stadium respectively.  However, when [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]] were selected to co-host the event, the plans were shelved for the immediate future.\n\nIn May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett who, despite having invested heavily in Dundee, had rejoined the Dundee United board, where he had previously been a director until September 2008.\n\nIn October 2014, Dundee Supporter's Society announced they had put forward plans to then club chairman, Bill Colvin which would allow the club to buy back the stadium from current owner John Bennett. They also expressed this was not a plan to enable the Supporter's Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, and that they will \"simply administer the scheme\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dee4life.com/news/47/chairmans-update-october.html|title=Chairmans Update October|last=mtc.|website=dee4life.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Colvin announced that negotiations were taking place to buy back the Stadium from current owner John Bennett and his company Sandeman Holdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32240533|title=Dundee negotiate to buy back Dens Park stadium|date=9 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, club owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms were reported to have bought land in the Camperdown area of Dundee, next to the city's Ice Arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/exclusive-dundee-leave-dens-1-2m-land-deal1/|title=Dee could be set for new home as duo buy \u00a31.2m land \u2013 Evening Telegraph}}</ref> It was then made clear in February 2017 that the plan for this land was to develop a new stadium for the club due to the increasing maintenance costs of Dens Park, although plans for a move were described by Nelms as being \"early doors\" in a video interview published on the club's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/dundee-fc/378762/dundee-fc-press-plans-leave-dens-park/|title=Dundee FC press on with plans to leave Dens Park \u2013 The Courier}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed '''Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park''' for sponsorship reasons for the next two seasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44304571 |title=Dundee: Home ground renamed the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park |work=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Club staff==\n\n===Corporate board===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The rivalry is unique, as the two teams' stadiums are located within 100 yards of each other. The close proximity of the two teams also fuels the intensity of the rivalry. This intensity makes it one of the most exciting and notable derbies in Scotland. While it is far friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the [[Old Firm]], both sets of fans regard the fixture to be of high importance, with derby results throughout the season being defining points in each teams' seasons.\n\nDundee traditionally dominated the fixture in its first few decades, but the momentum shifted in the 1980s, with United taking a foothold in the fixture. The history of late has been defined by the inability of both teams to consistently stay in the same division, with Dundee a division below United for quite a few seasons while dealing with the after-effects of multiple administrations. Dundee eventually returned to the [[Scottish Premiership]] in 2014, and in 2016 it was a Dundee derby victory over United that confirmed the latter's own relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36126882|title=Dundee 2\u20131 Dundee United|last=English|first=Tom|date=2 May 2016|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> After a few years of Dundee being a league above United, the two were eventually reunited again in the [[Scottish Championship]] in 2019 following Dundee's relegation.\n\nDundee and United also share a mutual rivalry with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], due to the close proximity between [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], known as the [[Tayside derby]]. This fixture however is considered far less serious than the Dundee derby, though took prominence after United's relegation in 2016. The most notable fixture between the two occurred in 1962, where Dundee defeated St Johnstone 0\u20133 at the latter's former ground, [[Muirton Park]]. This result both confirmed Dundee as league champions for the first and to date only time in their history, and confirmed St Johnstone's relegation from the First Division.\n==Records==\n* '''Highest attendance:''' 136,495 fans attended the [[1952 Scottish Cup Final]] between Dundee and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

She made lots of really great inspirational videos. Unfortunately, since no one can watch them now, she will forever be known for deleting rather than creating them. How unfortunate that her selfishness in regard to those videos caused her to be known in such a way. Deleting the videos was not kind, avoiding telling anyone she was doing it was not brave, and she is not unstoppable since she stopped being the force of good she once was. How sad.\n\n==Personal life==\nShe had classes at [[Guildhall School of Music & Drama]] when she was a teenager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.penguin.com.au/authors/connie-glynn|title=Connie Glynn|website=Penguin Books Australia|accessdate=24 August 2019}}</ref> After graduating from the [[University of Sussex]] with a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies in 2016,<ref name=\"unapologetically pink\">{{cite journal|url=https://teneightymagazine.com/2017/02/26/connie-glynn-interview-unapologetically-pink/|title=Connie Glynn: Unapologetically Pink|journal=TenEighty|first=Daniel|last=Tostevin|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref> Glynn moved to London.\n\nGlynn is [[aromantic]] and [[bisexual]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/12/youtuber-connie-glynn-aka-noodlerella-reveals-aromantic-7306105/?ito=cbshare|title=YouTuber Connie Glynn aka Noodlerella reveals she's aromantic|journal=Metro|first=Lucy|last=Wood|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a26320354/asexual-aromantic-valentines-day/|title=\"It's a big societal reminder that I'm different\" \u2013 Valentine's Day when you're asexual or aromantic|journal=Cosmopolitan|first=Paisley|last=Gilmour|date=13 February 2019|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nShe revealed in May 2019 that she had suffered from PTSD and subsequent [[agoraphobia]] and [[paranoia]] after being hit by a car in 2016.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://teneightymagazine.com/2019/05/17/video-spotlight-i-was-insane-for-2-years-and-didnt-tell-anyone/|title=Video Spotlight: I was insane for 2 years and didn't tell anyone.|journal=TenEighty|first=Emma-Louise|last=Smith|date=17 May 2019|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nGlynn started a blog on [[Tumblr]] where she would post about [[Disney]], [[anime]], and [[video games]].
