The series were developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Geoff Johns]], [[Ali Adler]], [[Phil Klemmer]], [[Salim Akil]] and [[Caroline Dries]], and based on characters appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. Set in a shared fictional multiverse much like the [[DC Universe]] and [[DC Multiverse]] in comic books, it was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters that span six live-action television series and two animated series.\n\nThe franchise began with ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', based on the character [[Green Arrow]], which debuted in October 2012. It was followed by ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' in 2014, and the animated web-series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' in 2015. The franchise was further expanded in 2016, when in January of that year a new series titled ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' debuted, starring characters that originally appeared on both ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''. Later that year, the [[CBS]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', having already crossed-over with ''The Flash'', was moved to The CW for its second season, where it has remained since. A second animated web-series, ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', was released in 2017, which followed [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray Terrill / The Ray]], who would make a live-action appearance during that year's crossover event \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\". In addition to the live-action and web-based series, the franchise has spawned three promotional tie-in live-action web series, ''Blood Rush'', ''Chronicles of Cisco'', and ''The Flash: Stretched Scenes''; released in 2013, 2016, and 2017 respectively. A fifth series, ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', premiered in 2019. Since 2014, there has been a yearly crossover event involving many of the live-action series of the Arrowverse. Additionally, [[Matt Ryan (actor)|Matt Ryan]] has reprised his role as [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] from the [[NBC]] series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', initially in guest appearances in episodes of ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'', before becoming a series regular for the latter, in addition to continuing storylines from the former series.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 crossovers, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" and \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", respectively, saw multiple DC television series and films be retroactively added to the franchise's multiverse. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" also rebooted the multiverse, which saw ''Supergirl'' join the other live-action series on a new fictional earth along with the series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', which had previously been separate up to this point. The franchise has been successful, creating a large fandom around the world and has received positive reviews, where critics praised the themes, performances, action sequences, direction and character development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Arrowverse key players.png|thumb|300px|right|The main character of each Arrowverse series.

''Supergirl'' already has that problem built-in with Superman, who it seems will not be a regular fixture on the show, and I'm sure there will be many excuses as to why he's too busy to help Supergirl fight her latest battle. Add in ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' mythology, and it's probably too much to juggle....I think ''Supergirl'' deserves to launch without ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' on its shoulders, and be allowed to find itself before being assimilated into an existing universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/#730b6ac65b57 |title=Why Supergirl Shouldn't Join The Flash/Arrowverse |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=May 14, 2015 |website=[[Forbes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130114227/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the premiere of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ScreenRant's Alice Walker discussed how the series \"has hurt ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''\", noting that the latter required minimal setup when it was spun-off from the former and had an element of mystery surrounding its quality with \"a \"wait and see\" attitude\" from audiences, while ''Legends'' was instead met with much excitement long before its release leading to each piece of news concerning it being \"publicized and met with fanfare \u2013 to the detriment of the other shows involved.\" Walker felt that audiences knowing which characters would appear in ''Legends'', and how, took \"the thrill out of the story\" of the other series as such information spoiled some of their upcoming plot twists, including the resurrection of Sara Lance or the fact that Ray Palmer \"could never really pose a threat to Oliver [Queen] and Felicity [Smoak]'s relationship, or run Palmer Technologies long term, since it was widely known that he would be a huge part of ''Legends''.\" Additionally, the annual ''Arrow''/''The Flash'' crossover suffered from also trying to set up ''Legends'', which was \"too much to ask from the already crowded storylines and ended up feeling like an exercise in synchronicity, with producers planting more seeds than they could reap. The crossover event was no longer a fun way to contrast the two shows; it now had to serve the much larger purpose of setting up an entirely new world.\" Walker stated that the premiere of ''Legends'' \"means that ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' can finally stop dedicating so much time and plot to laying the groundwork for the spin-off, and start focusing on the fundamentals of their own shows again.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |title=How Legends Of Tomorrow Has Hurt Arrow & The Flash |last=Walker |first=Alice |date=January 20, 2016 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408004114/http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Elseworlds\" crossover teased the comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' would be adapted in the 2019 crossover, Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek stated, \"The Arrowverse is becoming the most intricate, risky live action superhero universe in history.

primarily airing on [[The CW]] and [[web series]] airing on [[CW Seed]]. The series were developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Geoff Johns]], [[Ali Adler]], [[Phil Klemmer]], [[Salim Akil]] and [[Caroline Dries]], and based on characters appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. Set in a shared fictional multiverse much like the [[DC Universe]] and [[DC Multiverse]] in comic books, it was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters that span six live-action television series and two animated series.\n\nThe franchise began with ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', based on the character [[Green Arrow]], which debuted in October 2012. It was followed by ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' in 2014, and the animated web-series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' in 2015. The franchise was further expanded in 2016, when in January of that year a new series titled ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' debuted, starring characters that originally appeared on both ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''. Later that year, the [[CBS]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', having already crossed-over with ''The Flash'', was moved to The CW for its second season, where it has remained since. A second animated web-series, ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', was released in 2017, which followed [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray Terrill / The Ray]], who would make a live-action appearance during that year's crossover event \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\". In addition to the live-action and web-based series, the franchise has spawned three promotional tie-in live-action web series, ''Blood Rush'', ''Chronicles of Cisco'', and ''The Flash: Stretched Scenes''; released in 2013, 2016, and 2017 respectively. A fifth series, ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', premiered in 2019. Since 2014, there has been a yearly crossover event involving many of the live-action series of the Arrowverse. Additionally, [[Matt Ryan (actor)|Matt Ryan]] has reprised his role as [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]] from the [[NBC]] series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', initially in guest appearances in episodes of ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'', before becoming a series regular for the latter, in addition to continuing storylines from the former series.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 crossovers, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" and \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", respectively, saw multiple DC television series and films be retroactively added to the franchise's multiverse. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" also rebooted the multiverse, which saw ''Supergirl'' join the other live-action series on a new fictional earth along with the series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', which had previously been separate up to this point. The franchise has been successful, creating a large fandom around the world and has received positive reviews, where critics praised the themes, performances, action sequences, direction and character development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Arrowverse key players.png|thumb|300px|right|The main character of each Arrowverse series.

While the crossover episodes were definitely open to new viewers of either ''The Flash'' or ''Arrow'' (or both, presumably), with each episode wrapped up tidily by the end of its hour, plenty of show-specific plot stuff was advanced without spelling it out for newbies. New viewers to either show could follow along and have a good time, but veteran viewers were rewarded with major storyline motion.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2014/12/04/tv-review-the-flash-and-arrow-crossover-episodes |title=TV Review: The Flash And Arrow Crossover Episodes |last=Borders |first=Meredith |date=December 4, 2014 |website=Birth.Movies.Death. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130122809/http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2014/12/04/tv-review-the-flash-and-arrow-crossover-episodes |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the release of the first trailer for ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', Paul Tassi wrote for ''[[Forbes]]'' about why he felt that series should be kept separate from the Arrowverse: He called the moment in the ''Arrow'' third-season finale where Barry Allen appears briefly, but abruptly leaves since \"''Arrow'' needs to let its own characters solve its problems\", a \"weird moment\" that shows \"the cracks [that] form when it's just two shows that have to work together on the regular.\" Tassi then noted the further complications of adding ''Supergirl'', saying, \"The more shows you have, the more heroes you introduce, the harder it is to keep explaining away why they're not constantly around to help each other. ''Supergirl'' already has that problem built-in with Superman, who it seems will not be a regular fixture on the show, and I'm sure there will be many excuses as to why he's too busy to help Supergirl fight her latest battle. Add in ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' mythology, and it's probably too much to juggle....I think ''Supergirl'' deserves to launch without ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' on its shoulders, and be allowed to find itself before being assimilated into an existing universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/#730b6ac65b57 |title=Why Supergirl Shouldn't Join The Flash/Arrowverse |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=May 14, 2015 |website=[[Forbes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130114227/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the premiere of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ScreenRant's Alice Walker discussed how the series \"has hurt ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''\", noting that the latter required minimal setup when it was spun-off from the former and had an element of mystery surrounding its quality with \"a \"wait and see\" attitude\" from audiences, while ''Legends'' was instead met with much excitement long before its release leading to each piece of news concerning it being \"publicized and met with fanfare \u2013 to the detriment of the other shows involved.\" Walker felt that audiences knowing which characters would appear in ''Legends'', and how, took \"the thrill out of the story\" of the other series as such information spoiled some of their upcoming plot twists, including the resurrection of Sara Lance or the fact that Ray Palmer \"could never really pose a threat to Oliver [Queen] and Felicity [Smoak]'s relationship, or run Palmer Technologies long term, since it was widely known that he would be a huge part of ''Legends''.\" Additionally, the annual ''Arrow''/''The Flash'' crossover suffered from also trying to set up ''Legends'', which was \"too much to ask from the already crowded storylines and ended up feeling like an exercise in synchronicity, with producers planting more seeds than they could reap. The crossover event was no longer a fun way to contrast the two shows; it now had to serve the much larger purpose of setting up an entirely new world.\" Walker stated that the premiere of ''Legends'' \"means that ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' can finally stop dedicating so much time and plot to laying the groundwork for the spin-off, and start focusing on the fundamentals of their own shows again.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |title=How Legends Of Tomorrow Has Hurt Arrow & The Flash |last=Walker |first=Alice |date=January 20, 2016 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408004114/http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Elseworlds\" crossover teased the comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' would be adapted in the 2019 crossover, Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek stated, \"The Arrowverse is becoming the most intricate, risky live action superhero universe in history.

As he did not outlive his father and inherit the dukedom, he was known by his father's subsidiary title, [[Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]].\n\nManners served in the [[Seven Years' War]] as overall commander of the British troops on the battlefield and was subsequently rewarded with the post of [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]]. He was popular with his troops and many public houses are still named after him today.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn the eldest son of the [[John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland|3rd Duke of Rutland]] and Bridget Manners (n\u00e9e Sutton), John Manners was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], leaving in 1732 and graduated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1738.<ref>{{acad|id=MNRS738J|name=Manners, John Marquess of Granby}}</ref> In 1740 he went to Italy on the [[Grand Tour]] travelling eastwards to Turkey, returning in 1742.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/es/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L05170.html/f/45/L05170-45.pdf|title=The British Sale: Paintings, Drawings and Watercolours|publisher=Sotheby's|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Elected to Parliament==\nHe was returned as [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[pocket borough|family borough]] of [[Grantham (UK Parliament constituency)|Grantham]] in 1741, which was a [[market town]], however its [[wikt:electorate|electorate]] was relatively small and the affairs of its council were in the 18th century sponsored alternately by the titled Manners, [[Cust baronets|Cust]], [[Thorold baronets|Thorold]] and [[Heathcote baronets|Heathcote]] families who had nearby [[family seat|family estate]]s.<ref name=odnb>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17958?docPos=4 |title=John Manners, Marquess of Granby |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nIn 1745 he assisted his father set up a volunteer regiment in [[Rutland]] to assist in quelling the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rebellion]] of 1745. Although the regiment was limited to garrison duty at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], it was the only one of its type that raised its full quota of 780 recruits.<ref name=\"White-Spunner, p.232\">White-Spunner, p.232</ref> Manners received a commission as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] of the regiment.<ref name=odnb/> Even though the regiment never got beyond Newcastle, the young Marquess of Granby went to the front as a volunteer on the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]]'s staff and saw active service in the last stages of the insurrection, being present at the [[Battle of Culloden]]. In Newcastle the regiment mutinied because they had not been paid but Granby paid the money owed out of his own pocket before they were due to be disbanded.  Thereafter he left England for Flanders as Intelligence Officer to Cumberland.<ref name=\"White-Spunner, p.232\"/>\n\nIn 1752, the Government suggested to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] that Granby be appointed colonel of the prestigious [[Royal Horse Guards]] (Blues), in order to secure the parliamentary support of his family.<ref name=odnb/> The king initially refused to make the appointment.<ref name=odnb/> In the meantime, Granby advanced his parliamentary career, and was returned for [[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] in 1754.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9370|page=1|date=7 May 1754}}</ref> Though he despised faction in government, he allied himself with [[Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke|Viscount Royston]], the other [[Knights of the Shire|knight of the shire]], a government [[British Whig Party|whig]].\n\nThe king came to view him more favourably as he defended the [[First Newcastle Ministry|Newcastle ministry]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. He was promoted [[major-general]] on 18 March 1755,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9459|page=2|date=15 March 1755}}</ref> and was at last made Colonel of the Blues on 27 May 1758.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9794|page=1|date=23 May 1758}}</ref> On 21 August, Granby arrived at [[Munster]] as second in command to [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Sackville]], as the aged [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] had recently died.  The British cavalry were divided into Heavy and Light cavalry and drilled under the strong influence of [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Elliot]] and Granby himself.  Accredited as the greatest colonel since the [[Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], Granby was both courageous and competent as a soldier.<ref>White-Spunner, p. 229</ref> He was then appointed overall commander of the expedition, replacing Sackville on 21 August 1759.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9924|page=2|date=21 August 1759}}</ref> He became [[Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance]] on 15 September 1759.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9930|page=1|date=11 September 1759}}</ref>\n\nHe was one of the first who understood the importance of welfare and morale for the troops.  The character of British soldiering improved, and properly led the army was unbeatable in war.  Nearly all the portraits show him mounting a horse or helping the wounded.<ref>Brumwell & Speck, p. 166-7</ref> On 7 June 1760 he wrote to Viscount Barrington, Secretary at War, receiving a reply ten days later making enquiries as to the Hospital Board accommodation for his wounded men.<ref>Granby to Barrington, June 7, and Barrington to Granby, June 17, 1760; Shute Barrington, p.58</ref>\n\nGranby was sent to Paderborn in command of a cavalry brigade.<ref name=odnb/> While leading a charge at the [[Battle of Warburg]], he is said to \"have lost his hat and wig, forcing him to salute his commander without them\".  This incident is commemorated by the British Army tradition that non-commissioned officers and troopers of the [[Blues and Royals]] are the only soldiers of the British Army who may salute without wearing headdress.<ref>Interpretive sign at the [http://www.householdcavalrymuseum.co.uk/ Household Cavalry Museum] in London.</ref> He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in 1759<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9871|page=1|date=17\u201420 February 1759}}</ref> and later that year fought at the [[Battle of Minden]] as commander of the second line of cavalry under [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nGranby's success in commanding the allied cavalry required courage, control and communication, as well as skill in bringing the horse artillery to bear. The victory at the [[Battle of Warburg]] in July 1760 over an army three times the size distinguished his generalship, and marked him as a genuine British military hero.  His opponent, the [[Victor Fran\u00e7ois de Broglie, Duke of Broglie|duc de Broglie]], was so impressed that he commissioned a portrait of Granby by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]].  Further successes came at the [[Battle of Emsdorf]] in July 1760, the [[Battle of Villinghausen]] in July 1761 and at the [[Battle of Wilhelmsthal]] in June 1762.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Political offices==\nGranby returned to England as a hero: a painting by [[Edward Penny]], ''The Marquess of Granby Relieving a Sick Soldier'', showed him acting as a man of charity rather than as a soldier and this assured his appeal to the people.  He sought to steer a path independent of party politics but supported the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].  He trusted [[George Grenville]] who promptly appointed him [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] under his ministry on 14 May 1763.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=10312|page=5|date=10 May 1763}}</ref> Granby was also made [[Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire]] on 21 February 1764.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=10393|page=1|date=18 February 1764}}</ref>\n[[File:John Manners Marquess of Granby 1763 65.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Granby painted by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], 1763\u201365.]]\n\nGranby supported the government's issue of [[Writ of assistance|general warrant]]s and prosecution of [[John Wilkes|Wilkes]], but in 1765 spoke against the dismissal of army officers for voting against the government in Parliament.  In May 1765, [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] attempted to persuade [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to appoint Granby [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]], in the hopes that his popularity would help quell the riot of the London silk weavers.  The king refused, having promised the reversion of the post to the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], but obtained Granby's retention as Master-General of the Ordnance in the new [[First Rockingham Ministry|Rockingham ministry]], although Granby did not co-operate with the ministry and voted against the repeal of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nUnder the [[Chatham Ministry]], Granby was appointed commander-in-chief on 13 August 1766. Despite rumours of his retirement, he vigorously electioneered during the 1768 season, and increased the Rutland interests seats to seven, at some expense.  With the resignation of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Chatham]], he found himself somewhat isolated in the [[Grafton Ministry]].  While he had opposed the attempts of the government to expel Wilkes from his seat in [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]], his personal dislike of Wilkes overcame his principles, and he voted in favor of the expulsion on 3 February 1769 and for the seating of [[Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton|Henry Luttrell]] afterwards.  It was to prove a serious political mistake. [[Junius]], a political writer, attacked the ministry accusing Granby of servility towards the court and personal corruption.  Granby's great popularity might have let him ride out the affair, but his reversal on Wilkes provided new ammunition.  Worse still, a reply to Junius by his friend [[William Draper (British Army officer)|Sir William Draper]], intended in his defence, essentially validated the charge that the hard-drinking and personable Granby was easily imposed upon by less scrupulous acquaintances.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nUltimately, it was not the attacks of Junius, but the return of Chatham that brought about his departure from politics. Granby had always respected Chatham, and through the mediation of [[John Calcraft]], was eventually persuaded to break with the ministry.  On 9 January 1770, he announced that he had reversed himself once more on the propriety of expelling Wilkes, and shortly thereafter resigned as commander-in-chief and [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], retaining only the colonelcy of the Blues.<ref name=odnb/>\n[[File:The Marquis of Granby, Waddingham.jpg|thumb|right|An inn in Lincolnshire, one of many named after him|250px]]\n\nOnce out of office, Granby found himself hard-pressed by his creditors, and the loss of his official salaries had weakened his financial position.  In the summer of 1770, he unsuccessfully campaigned for [[George Cockburne]] at the Scarborough by-election.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Death==\n\nGranby died at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], Yorkshire, in 1770.<ref name=odnb/> The outpouring of grief was real and sustained.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/manuscriptshisg00unkngoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/manuscriptshisg00unkngoog/page/n225 213] |quote=thomas thoroton marquess of granby. |title=The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland, Preserved at Belvoir Castle, Charles Manners Rutland, Richard Ward, John Horace Round, Robert Campbell|publisher= Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London|year=1889|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> His friend and associate Levett Blackborne, a [[Lincoln's Inn]] barrister and Manners family adviser who frequently resided at Belvoir, was away at the time, visiting a family relation of Manners' and received the disturbing news on his return to Belvoir.

I had been spending a week with my sister Chaplin at Tathwell when an itinerant clergyman... mentioned at dinner news of what happened at Scarborough the preceding Thursday.... The next morning brought me a letter from Tom Thoroton (Col. Thomas Thoroton, Levett Blackborne's stepbrother) confirming the whole and insisting on my speedy return to Belvoir, where I arrived the night after poor Lord Granby's remains had been deposited at Bottesford.\" (see again [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&id=hCoRAAAAYAAJ&dq=thomas+blackborne+thoroton&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&q=levett#PPA2,M1 The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland]) Other observers also confirmed that a close relationship existed between the families of Thoroton and the Manners, Dukes of Rutland. In her diary, Abigail Gawthem of Nottinghamshire commented that the woman-in-question was \"mistress to the old John, Duke of Rutland, and mother to old Mrs. Thoroton of Screveton.\" The unexplained conjugal connection helps explain the close relationships between the Suttons, Manners, Thorotons, Levetts, Chaplins and other families. Who the woman-in-question was remains to be solved. Contemporary legal accounts confirm the illegitimacy of at least one of the Manners offspring.(see [https://books.google.com/books?id=NIkwAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA419&dq=thoroton+v.+thoroton The Revised reports: being a republication of such cases in the English courts of common law and equity, from the year 1785, as are still of practical utility. 1785-1866, Volume 10)] And the subsequent lawsuit of Thoroton v.

As he did not outlive his father and inherit the dukedom, he was known by his father's subsidiary title, [[Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]].\n\nManners served in the [[Seven Years' War]] as overall commander of the British troops on the battlefield and was subsequently rewarded with the post of [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]]. He was popular with his troops and many public houses are still named after him today.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn the eldest son of the [[John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland|3rd Duke of Rutland]] and Bridget Manners (n\u00e9e Sutton), John Manners was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], leaving in 1732 and graduated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1738.<ref>{{acad|id=MNRS738J|name=Manners, John Marquess of Granby}}</ref> In 1740 he went to Italy on the [[Grand Tour]] travelling eastwards to Turkey, returning in 1742.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/es/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L05170.html/f/45/L05170-45.pdf|title=The British Sale: Paintings, Drawings and Watercolours|publisher=Sotheby's|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Elected to Parliament==\nHe was returned as [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[pocket borough|family borough]] of [[Grantham (UK Parliament constituency)|Grantham]] in 1741, which was a [[market town]], however its [[wikt:electorate|electorate]] was relatively small and the affairs of its council were in the 18th century sponsored alternately by the titled Manners, [[Cust baronets|Cust]], [[Thorold baronets|Thorold]] and [[Heathcote baronets|Heathcote]] families who had nearby [[family seat|family estate]]s.<ref name=odnb>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17958?docPos=4 |title=John Manners, Marquess of Granby |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nIn 1745 he assisted his father set up a volunteer regiment in [[Rutland]] to assist in quelling the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rebellion]] of 1745. Although the regiment was limited to garrison duty at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], it was the only one of its type that raised its full quota of 780 recruits.<ref name=\"White-Spunner, p.232\">White-Spunner, p.232</ref> Manners received a commission as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] of the regiment.<ref name=odnb/> Even though the regiment never got beyond Newcastle, the young Marquess of Granby went to the front as a volunteer on the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]]'s staff and saw active service in the last stages of the insurrection, being present at the [[Battle of Culloden]]. In Newcastle the regiment mutinied because they had not been paid but Granby paid the money owed out of his own pocket before they were due to be disbanded.  Thereafter he left England for Flanders as Intelligence Officer to Cumberland.<ref name=\"White-Spunner, p.232\"/>\n\nIn 1752, the Government suggested to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] that Granby be appointed colonel of the prestigious [[Royal Horse Guards]] (Blues), in order to secure the parliamentary support of his family.<ref name=odnb/> The king initially refused to make the appointment.<ref name=odnb/> In the meantime, Granby advanced his parliamentary career, and was returned for [[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] in 1754.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9370|page=1|date=7 May 1754}}</ref> Though he despised faction in government, he allied himself with [[Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke|Viscount Royston]], the other [[Knights of the Shire|knight of the shire]], a government [[British Whig Party|whig]].\n\nThe king came to view him more favourably as he defended the [[First Newcastle Ministry|Newcastle ministry]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. He was promoted [[major-general]] on 18 March 1755,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9459|page=2|date=15 March 1755}}</ref> and was at last made Colonel of the Blues on 27 May 1758.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9794|page=1|date=23 May 1758}}</ref> On 21 August, Granby arrived at [[Munster]] as second in command to [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Sackville]], as the aged [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] had recently died.  The British cavalry were divided into Heavy and Light cavalry and drilled under the strong influence of [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Elliot]] and Granby himself.  Accredited as the greatest colonel since the [[Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], Granby was both courageous and competent as a soldier.<ref>White-Spunner, p. 229</ref> He was then appointed overall commander of the expedition, replacing Sackville on 21 August 1759.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9924|page=2|date=21 August 1759}}</ref> He became [[Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance]] on 15 September 1759.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9930|page=1|date=11 September 1759}}</ref>\n\nHe was one of the first who understood the importance of welfare and morale for the troops.  The character of British soldiering improved, and properly led the army was unbeatable in war.  Nearly all the portraits show him mounting a horse or helping the wounded.<ref>Brumwell & Speck, p. 166-7</ref> On 7 June 1760 he wrote to Viscount Barrington, Secretary at War, receiving a reply ten days later making enquiries as to the Hospital Board accommodation for his wounded men.<ref>Granby to Barrington, June 7, and Barrington to Granby, June 17, 1760; Shute Barrington, p.58</ref>\n\nGranby was sent to Paderborn in command of a cavalry brigade.<ref name=odnb/> While leading a charge at the [[Battle of Warburg]], he is said to \"have lost his hat and wig, forcing him to salute his commander without them\".  This incident is commemorated by the British Army tradition that non-commissioned officers and troopers of the [[Blues and Royals]] are the only soldiers of the British Army who may salute without wearing headdress.<ref>Interpretive sign at the [http://www.householdcavalrymuseum.co.uk/ Household Cavalry Museum] in London.</ref> He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in 1759<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=9871|page=1|date=17\u201420 February 1759}}</ref> and later that year fought at the [[Battle of Minden]] as commander of the second line of cavalry under [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nGranby's success in commanding the allied cavalry required courage, control and communication, as well as skill in bringing the horse artillery to bear. The victory at the [[Battle of Warburg]] in July 1760 over an army three times the size distinguished his generalship, and marked him as a genuine British military hero.  His opponent, the [[Victor Fran\u00e7ois de Broglie, Duke of Broglie|duc de Broglie]], was so impressed that he commissioned a portrait of Granby by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]].  Further successes came at the [[Battle of Emsdorf]] in July 1760, the [[Battle of Villinghausen]] in July 1761 and at the [[Battle of Wilhelmsthal]] in June 1762.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Political offices==\nGranby returned to England as a hero: a painting by [[Edward Penny]], ''The Marquess of Granby Relieving a Sick Soldier'', showed him acting as a man of charity rather than as a soldier and this assured his appeal to the people.  He sought to steer a path independent of party politics but supported the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].  He trusted [[George Grenville]] who promptly appointed him [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] under his ministry on 14 May 1763.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=10312|page=5|date=10 May 1763}}</ref> Granby was also made [[Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire]] on 21 February 1764.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=10393|page=1|date=18 February 1764}}</ref>\n[[File:John Manners Marquess of Granby 1763 65.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Granby painted by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], 1763-65.]]\n\nGranby supported the government's issue of [[Writ of assistance|general warrant]]s and prosecution of [[John Wilkes|Wilkes]], but in 1765 spoke against the dismissal of army officers for voting against the government in Parliament.  In May 1765, [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] attempted to persuade [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to appoint Granby [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]], in the hopes that his popularity would help quell the riot of the London silk weavers.  The king refused, having promised the reversion of the post to the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], but obtained Granby's retention as Master-General of the Ordnance in the new [[First Rockingham Ministry|Rockingham ministry]], although Granby did not co-operate with the ministry and voted against the repeal of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nUnder the [[Chatham Ministry]], Granby was appointed commander-in-chief on 13 August 1766. Despite rumours of his retirement, he vigorously electioneered during the 1768 season, and increased the Rutland interests seats to seven, at some expense.  With the resignation of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Chatham]], he found himself somewhat isolated in the [[Grafton Ministry]].  While he had opposed the attempts of the government to expel Wilkes from his seat in [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]], his personal dislike of Wilkes overcame his principles, and he voted in favor of the expulsion on 3 February 1769 and for the seating of [[Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton|Henry Luttrell]] afterwards.  It was to prove a serious political mistake. [[Junius]], a political writer, attacked the ministry accusing Granby of servility towards the court and personal corruption.  Granby's great popularity might have let him ride out the affair, but his reversal on Wilkes provided new ammunition.  Worse still, a reply to Junius by his friend [[William Draper (British Army officer)|Sir William Draper]], intended in his defence, essentially validated the charge that the hard-drinking and personable Granby was easily imposed upon by less scrupulous acquaintances.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nUltimately, it was not the attacks of Junius, but the return of Chatham that brought about his departure from politics. Granby had always respected Chatham, and through the mediation of [[John Calcraft]], was eventually persuaded to break with the ministry.  On 9 January 1770, he announced that he had reversed himself once more on the propriety of expelling Wilkes, and shortly thereafter resigned as commander-in-chief and [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], retaining only the colonelcy of the Blues.<ref name=odnb/>\n[[File:The Marquis of Granby, Waddingham.jpg|thumb|right|An inn in Lincolnshire, one of many named after him|250px]]\n\nOnce out of office, Granby found himself hard-pressed by his creditors, and the loss of his official salaries had weakened his financial position.  In the summer of 1770, he unsuccessfully campaigned for [[George Cockburne]] at the Scarborough by-election.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Death==\n\nGranby died at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], Yorkshire, in 1770.<ref name=odnb/> The outpouring of grief was real and sustained.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/manuscriptshisg00unkngoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/manuscriptshisg00unkngoog/page/n225 213] |quote=thomas thoroton marquess of granby. |title=The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland, Preserved at Belvoir Castle, Charles Manners Rutland, Richard Ward, John Horace Round, Robert Campbell|publisher= Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London|year=1889|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> His friend and associate Levett Blackborne, a [[Lincoln's Inn]] barrister and Manners family adviser who frequently resided at Belvoir, was away at the time, visiting a family relation of Manners' and received the disturbing news on his return to Belvoir.

I had been spending a week with my sister Chaplin at Tathwell when an itinerant clergyman... mentioned at dinner news of what happened at Scarborough the preceding Thursday.... The next morning brought me a letter from Tom Thoroton (Col.

In her diary, Abigail Gawthem of Nottinghamshire commented that the woman-in-question was \"mistress to the old John, Duke of Rutland, and mother to old Mrs. Thoroton of Screveton.\" The unexplained conjugal connection helps explain the close relationships between the Suttons, Manners, Thorotons, Levetts, Chaplins and other families. Who the woman-in-question was remains to be solved.

(Dublin: Solo Books). 2007. pages 37\u201338.</ref> are puppets, supposedly twins, and are the central characters on ''[[A Scare at Bedtime]]'', an Irish adult comedy [[Television|televised]] [[puppet]] show. Created and performed by [[Ciaran Morrison]] and [[Mick O'Hara]], more recently, the brothers have presented ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show]]'', a chat show in the same vein, and ''[[Podge & Rodge's Stickit Inn]]'', set in a pub. Morrison and O'Hara also created and perform the characters of [[Zig and Zag (puppets)|Zig and Zag]], [[Bronx Bunny]], and [[Teddy T]].\n\n==Character history==\n\n===Origins===\nPodge originally appeared as a \"villain\" character on the children's programming block, ''[[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]]''. He was introduced in 1990, as an ordinary puppet that Zag (of [[Zig and Zag (puppets)|Zig and Zag]]) had found in a box amongst the rubbish behind an old joke shop. Dubbing the puppet \"Podge,\" Zag used him to practise ventriloquism, and would put on the \"Podge and Zag\" show, which a jealous Zig usually interrupted. Things took a sinister turn one day, when during one of these shorts, a mysterious voice said to Zag, \"aren't you a smelly stupid ugly alien\". Soon after, the truth of Podge was revealed to the audience: alone with Zig at the conclusion of the broadcasting day, he showed that he was actually alive, moving and speaking on his own, bullying Zig and telling him he would be his friend if he stole the bike presently being offered as a competition prize. Zag and presenter [[Ray D'Arcy]] remained oblivious to Podge's true nature for some time; Podge would occasionally move in the background during continuity announcements between programmes, or be seen scheming on his own, and letters and pictures would pour in from the viewing children trying to let them know that the little puppet was evil. Eventually, after Zig finally told Zag and Ray the truth, Podge made a power play and took over the programme for a day, revealing that he had been brought to life by a magician, but then sealed away when he turned evil. Podge also possessed some magical powers of his own that he'd learned from the magician, and turned one of the crew members into a teapot. He was finally dealt with when the magician arrived at the end of the programming day, hypnotised Podge (who the magician called \"Albert\"), and took him away.\n\n===As a recurring villain===\n[[File:Podge as Santa on The Den.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Podge once attempted to ruin Christmas for ''The Den'' crew by kidnapping Santa and putting on his suit.]]\nFollowing his initial \"story arc,\" Podge became a recurring presence on The Den over the next six years, causing trouble by using one of many paper-thins disguises that the gang could never see through, despite his constant insults and use his catchphrase, \"Oh rrrrreally?\" Over the years, he posed as a child named \"Patrick Egdop,\" a postman also named Patrick, a leprechaun, a trick-or-treater, a health inspector, a taxi-driver, and a builder named \"Diglas McDoug.\" He physically fought with [[Dustin the Turkey]] upon their first meeting, establishing a pattern that would often repeat when they met again; once, he locked Dustin in the cupboard under the stairs and attempted to take his place by means of disguising himself with a few feathers and a coffee cup for a beak. He often sought to eat [[Zuppy]], who could always see through his disguises and was responsible for his being caught out several times. His \"magical\" origins were never referred to again, but he retained some of his powers, able to disappear into thin air to escape when his disguises were seen through.\n\nPodge's most daring scheme was 1992's \"Christmas Crisis,\" in which he tried to ensure that Zig would receive no presents from [[Santa Claus]], using his postman disguise to enter their home, break one of the presents, for which Zig would be blamed, and also make off with a bottle of \"Scent of Man\", a cologne which he would develop a great fondness for, which would often give away his identity. Zig was able to prove his innocence, but Podge was still intent on ruining Christmas, taking the gang's Christmas letters and not delivering them to Santa. When ''The Den'' crew set out to do the job themselves, Podge kidnapped Santa and took his place but was thwarted in the end.\n\nEventually, in 1996, Podge was finally well and truly caught by the Den gang, only to be freed by his never-before-seen twin brother, Rodge, posing as a policeman, who escorted him away. The \"Dastardly Duo\" continued to make trouble for the gang over the following year, mostly on the holidays; they staged \"Christmas Crisis II\" in 1996 to try and ruin the gang's Christmas once again. Rodge's precise origins were never gone into (the young children who were the programme's target audience had not been around for Podge's own introduction years before, after all, so it didn't really matter), but he possessed the same \"vanishing\" power Podge did, as well as the same fondness for Scent of Man and taste for dog. The brothers had particular contempt for ''[[Echo Island]]'', especially the version broadcast in Irish.\n\n===Ballydung===\nIn 1997, Podge and Rodge were transitioned from the Den to their own, adult-oriented comedy show, ''[[A Scare at Bedtime]]''. The show ignored their established history from their earlier, child-friendly appearances, and created a new one for them: in this series, the aged brothers live in Ballydung Manor, a fictional estate located their fictional hometown in Ballydung (off the bypass past Ballywank) in County Ring, a converted asylum which they share with an insane old nurse they call \"Granny,\" as well as their disease-ridden pet cat Pox, and a nicotine-addicted monkey named Spunky. By this show's telling of events, the two brothers have lived together for decades, and hate one another, but Podge has repeatedly sabotaged any attempts by Rodge to leave him and improve his life.\n\nBallydung Manor may be reached by dialling Ballydung 666 from a telephone. In the earliest seasons of the show, the brothers' shared bedroom was the only part of the manor shown, but in later years, their kitchen was also used. This remained largely the case during the follow-up series ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show]]'', although the living room was featured in the ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show#New Year's Eve special|Bogmannay]]'' special on New Year's Eve 2006. The underground dungeon of Ballydung Manor was also shown in an episode of the chatshow when Podge and Rodge invited guest [[Sheana Keane]] to [[Features of The Podge and Rodge Show#Operation!|partake in a gruesome game of Operation!]].\n\nAnother location known to be in Ballydung is \"The Stickitt Inn\", which features on the chat show. Ballydung also has a bypass which was blocked off by a swarm of locusts on the Christmas Special of 2006, ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show#Christmas special|A Frightmare Before Christmas]]'', thus preventing any of the guests attending the show.\n\n==Television and radio shows==\n\n===''A Scare at Bedtime'' (1997\u20132006)===\n{{main article|A Scare at Bedtime}}\n''A Scare at Bedtime'' took its name from the nightly RT\u00c9 show called ''[[A Prayer at Bedtime]]'', which overlaid the text of a [[Roman Catholic]] prayer over serene images with [[choral music]] playing. A Scare at Bedtime, first aired in 1997, is close to being the polar opposite of this, with extremely adult content, lewd jokes and slightly obscene anecdotes being related by the two puppets. Their origins on the Den are largely ignored, as the backstory gradually established on A Scare at Bedtime, presents them to be both in their fifties (although they don't look any different from how they used to), and residing in [[Ballydung Manor]], the former Ballydung Asylum. Rumour has it that their parents left them in the asylum many years ago, and in revenge, Rodge took an axe to them both. But no bodies were ever found. They live with a lunatic nurse that they call \"Granny\" who practices the black arts (since she is dating Satan, whom they refer to as the \"quare fella\" throughout the series) and Pox the cat who suffers from rabies, the pox, and extreme violence at the hands of its two owners. Their hobbies include cockfighting and exorcisms of which Father Flange occasionally does special sessions. They have been given full names also: Padraig Judas O'Leprosy and Rodraig Spartacus O'Leprosy.\n\nEach episode follows the same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair would get into bed but in recent seasons they sit at the kitchen table. They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually insulting him. This leads Podge on to telling a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to [[masturbation]]. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.\n\n''[[A Scare at Bedtime]]'' never officially ended and the show has run to nine series as of January 2006, with the first five series available on DVD. An eight disc DVD box set of all nine seasons of 150 episodes (including fifty never for sale before) was released at Halloween 2010. The series has aired in both the UK and Ireland on [[RT\u00c9 Two]], [[Tara TV]], [[BBC]] [[UK Play]] and the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]]. ''A Scare at Bedtime'' was nominated in the Best Entertainment Programme category of the [[Irish Film and Television Academy Awards]] in both 1999 and 2000. Winning the [[Irish Film and Television Awards|IFTA]] for Best Entertainment Programme in 2000.\n\n===''Podge and Rodge's TV Bodges'' (2000)===\nIn 2000, Podge and Rodge hosted a series made up of ten eight-minute episodes entitled ''[[Podge & Rodge's TV Bodges]]'' for [[BBC Prime]]. It was a collection of TV mishaps akin to ''[[It'll be Alright on the Night]]''. The series was broadcast all over the world via [[BBC Worldwide]].\n\n===''Ballydung Radio'' (2000)===\nPodge and Rodge were commissioned by [[UK Play]] in 2000 to create a music/comedy hybrid show. 20 x 30min programmes were broadcast. Podge and Rodge hosted the series from their home made [[pirate radio]] studio set up in Ballydung Manor. The show featured pop videos of the moment in between comedy links performed by the duo.\n\n===RT\u00c9 Two relaunch (2004)===\nPodge and Rodge hosted the relaunch of Network 2 as RT\u00c9 Two in 2004.<ref name=\"Network 2 goes gay for ratings\"/> They introduced the night's television programming which consisted of ''[[Premier Soccer Saturday|The Premiership]]'' at 20:00 followed by a highlights reel of Network 2, new comedy sketch show ''[[Stew (TV series)|Stew]]'' at 21:30, a repeat broadcast of the final episode of ''[[Paths to Freedom]]'' and the television premiere of the film ''[[Spin the Bottle (2003 film)|Spin the Bottle]]''.<ref name=\"Network 2 goes gay for ratings\"/> The relaunch was part of an RT\u00c9 initiative to promote \"edgier\" and \"riskier\" viewing that would \"push the boundaries\", which included a [[Homosexuality|gay]] theme night.<ref name=\"Network 2 goes gay for ratings\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article486871.ece|title=Network 2 goes gay for ratings|date=26 September 2004|accessdate=30 July 2009|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London|first=Jan|last=Battles}}</ref>\n\n===''The Podge and Rodge Show'' (2006\u20132010)===\n{{main article|The Podge and Rodge Show}}\nFirst aired on 6 February 2006, '''''The Podge and Rodge Show''''' fulfilled the duo's main aim by being their first chatshow. It was co-hosted by [[Lucy Kennedy]] and airs at 22:30 on Monday and 22:50 on Tuesday nights on [[RT\u00c9 Two]]. The show has been a phenomenal ratings success, regularly getting over 400,000 viewers a show. It won \"Favourite Irish TV Show\" for two years in a row at the 2006 and 2007 [[TV Now Awards]]. It was also nominated for an [[IFTA Award]] for \"Best Entertainment Show 2007\" and won the award in 2008. The second series began on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] on 16 October 2006, with a month break in January before returning on 5 February 2007 and running until April 2007. A third series, began on 15 October 2007 and ran until 15 April 2008 with a month break in January. The fourth series kicked off on 20 October 2008 without Lucy Kennedy, who was replaced by weekly female guest hosts. The show again took a break over Christmas and returned on 9 February 2009 for a further 10-week run with [[Caroline Morahan]] as the new host until 14 April 2009. Which turned out to be the final episode of the series as it was announced that a new format ''[[Podge & Rodge's Stickit Inn]]'', a celebrity pub quiz would replace the chat show in the Autumn 2009 schedule. However, the show returned in the [[Stickit Inn]] pub set in 2010, and ran until 27 April 2010.\n\n;Christmas special\n:''For full article, see [[List of The Podge and Rodge Show episodes#Christmas special 2006|A Frightmare Before Christmas]]''\nPodge and Rodge hosted a special show from Ballydung Manor on 19 December 2006, entitled ''A Frightmare Before Christmas''. It celebrated Christmas from their perspective, a reality where none of the intended guests turned up, and imaginary scenarios where the worst possible guests did. In reality Podge and Rodge and Lucy were left in the darkness of Ballydung Manor as the thunder raged outside, imagining their nightmare guests.\n\n;New Year's Eve specials\n:''For full article, see [[List of The Podge and Rodge Show episodes#New Year's Eve special 2006|Bogmannay]]''\nPodge and Rodge rang in 2007 on 31 December in a special programme lasting over forty minutes instead of the usual thirty-minute format. The New Year's Eve show was called ''Bogmanay'' (a play on [[Hogmanay]]). It was broadcast on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] from 22:30.\n\nOn it the boys looked back at some of the highlights of their year. They also handed out their very own Feckin' Eejit of the Year Awards (FEEJITs) to celebrate the great tradition of Irish Feckin' Eejitry. There were nine nominees chosen from the worlds of TV, entertainment, sport and politics.\n\nGuests included [[Edele Lynch|Edele]] and [[Keavy Lynch]] of [[B*Witched]] fame, [[Mary Black]], [[Jason Donovan]] and [[Freddie Starr]] returned as the Ballydung Butler for the evening.\n\nSuch was the success of the original ''Bogmanay'', Podge and Rodge hosted a second ''Bogmanay'' to ring in 2008. It featured guests [[Miss Ireland]], Bl\u00e1thnaid McKenna and [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Frank Bruno]] as well as [[David Gest|Mr. Gest]] who was unable to be interviewed as Lucy Kennedy, venturing into his dressing room, discovered he had turned into an ape. Instead a number of previously unseen clips which were not allowed to be shown before midnight were shown, including some in which Lucy Kennedy swore. A number of \"Half- Arse Hero\" awards were handed out, although none of the recipients (who included [[Steve Staunton]]) were present to accept them.\n\n;People in Need Telethon 2007 special\nOn Friday 26 October 2007 for the [[People in Need Telethon]] Podge and Rodge finally got to interview their nemesis and ultimate rival, the then host of ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' and ''\"Ireland's [[Alan Partridge]]\"'' [[Pat Kenny]]. ''\"Do the words lamb and slaughter mean anything to you?\"'' He was asked: ''\"Does it get on your tits though when people are saying, Jaysus \u2013 Pat Kenny earns how much? He should be paying me to watch that shite!\"'' He was also asked: ''\"Where did the nickname Pat the Plank come from? Who came up with that beauty?\"'' Pat blamed it on [[Eamon Dunphy]]. ''\"Are you bored with the wood puns?\"'' they asked to which Pat jibed: ''\"In fairness lads I'm not the puppet round here.\"'' Then it was time for a quick game of \"Plankety Plank\" which featured author [[Patricia Cornwell]] \u2013 he'd forgotten her name; [[Dawn French]] \u2013 he'd told her he'd give her \u20ac10 not to get out of bed; [[Brigitte Nielsen]] \u2013 she'd forced him to dance live on TV. Comparing Pat's bike to [[Gay Byrne|Gaybo]]'s [[Harley-Davidson]] they asked: ''\"Did Fisher Price make that?\"'' And then it was back to [[Ryan Tubridy|Tubbicino, Teletubby]]...\n\n;Best of The Podge and Rodge Show\nFrom 21 July 2009, RT\u00c9 began showing a compilation of the best moments of the first three series of ''The Podge and Rodge Show''.

(Dublin: Solo Books). 2007. pages 37\u201338.</ref> are puppets, supposedly twins,and are the central characters on ''[[A Scare at Bedtime]]'', an Irish adult comedy [[Television|televised]] [[puppet]] show. Created and performed by [[Ciaran Morrison]] and [[Mick O'Hara]], more recently, the brothers have presented ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show]]'', a chat show in the same vein, and ''[[Podge & Rodge's Stickit Inn]]'', set in a pub. Morrison and O'Hara also created and perform the characters of [[Zig and Zag (puppets)|Zig and Zag]], [[Bronx Bunny]], and [[Teddy T]].\n\n==Character history==\n\n===Origins===\nPodge originally appeared as a \"villain\" character on the children's programming block, ''[[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]]''. He was introduced in 1990, as an ordinary puppet that Zag (of [[Zig and Zag (puppets)|Zig and Zag]]) had found in a box amongst the rubbish behind an old joke shop. Dubbing the puppet \"Podge,\" Zag used him to practise ventriloquism, and would put on the \"Podge and Zag\" show, which a jealous Zig usually interrupted. Things took a sinister turn one day, when during one of these shorts, a mysterious voice said to Zag, \"aren't you a smelly stupid ugly alien\". Soon after, the truth of Podge was revealed to the audience: alone with Zig at the conclusion of the broadcasting day, he showed that he was actually alive, moving and speaking on his own, bullying Zig and telling him he would be his friend if he stole the bike presently being offered as a competition prize. Zag and presenter [[Ray D'Arcy]] remained oblivious to Podge's true nature for some time; Podge would occasionally move in the background during continuity announcements between programmes, or be seen scheming on his own, and letters and pictures would pour in from the viewing children trying to let them know that the little puppet was evil. Eventually, after Zig finally told Zag and Ray the truth, Podge made a power play and took over the programme for a day, revealing that he had been brought to life by a magician, but then sealed away when he turned evil. Podge also possessed some magical powers of his own that he'd learned from the magician, and turned one of the crew members into a teapot. He was finally dealt with when the magician arrived at the end of the programming day, hypnotised Podge (who the magician called \"Albert\"), and took him away.\n\n===As a recurring villain===\n[[File:Podge as Santa on The Den.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Podge once attempted to ruin Christmas for ''The Den'' crew by kidnapping Santa and putting on his suit.]]\nFollowing his initial \"story arc,\" Podge became a recurring presence on The Den over the next six years, causing trouble by using one of many paper-thins disguises that the gang could never see through, despite his constant insults and use his catchphrase, \"Oh rrrrreally?\" Over the years, he posed as a child named \"Patrick Egdop,\" a postman also named Patrick, a leprechaun, a trick-or-treater, a health inspector, a taxi-driver, and a builder named \"Diglas McDoug.\" He physically fought with [[Dustin the Turkey]] upon their first meeting, establishing a pattern that would often repeat when they met again; once, he locked Dustin in the cupboard under the stairs and attempted to take his place by means of disguising himself with a few feathers and a coffee cup for a beak. He often sought to eat [[Zuppy]], who could always see through his disguises and was responsible for his being caught out several times. His \"magical\" origins were never referred to again, but he retained some of his powers, able to disappear into thin air to escape when his disguises were seen through.\n\nPodge's most daring scheme was 1992's \"Christmas Crisis,\" in which he tried to ensure that Zig would receive no presents from [[Santa Claus]], using his postman disguise to enter their home, break one of the presents, for which Zig would be blamed, and also make off with a bottle of \"Scent of Man\", a cologne which he would develop a great fondness for, which would often give away his identity. Zig was able to prove his innocence, but Podge was still intent on ruining Christmas, taking the gang's Christmas letters and not delivering them to Santa. When ''The Den'' crew set out to do the job themselves, Podge kidnapped Santa and took his place but was thwarted in the end.\n\nEventually, in 1996, Podge was finally well and truly caught by the Den gang, only to be freed by his never-before-seen twin brother, Rodge, posing as a policeman, who escorted him away. The \"Dastardly Duo\" continued to make trouble for the gang over the following year, mostly on the holidays; they staged \"Christmas Crisis II\" in 1996 to try and ruin the gang's Christmas once again. Rodge's precise origins were never gone into (the young children who were the programme's target audience had not been around for Podge's own introduction years before, after all, so it didn't really matter), but he possessed the same \"vanishing\" power Podge did, as well as the same fondness for Scent of Man and taste for dog. The brothers had particular contempt for ''[[Echo Island]]'', especially the version broadcast in Irish.\n\n===Ballydung===\nIn 1997, Podge and Rodge were transitioned from the Den to their own, adult-oriented comedy show, ''[[A Scare at Bedtime]]''. The show ignored their established history from their earlier, child-friendly appearances, and created a new one for them: in this series, the aged brothers live in Ballydung Manor, a fictional estate located their fictional hometown in Ballydung (off the bypass past Ballywank) in County Ring, a converted asylum which they share with an insane old nurse they call \"Granny,\" as well as their disease-ridden pet cat Pox, and a nicotine-addicted monkey named Spunky. By this show's telling of events, the two brothers have lived together for decades, and hate one another, but Podge has repeatedly sabotaged any attempts by Rodge to leave him and improve his life.\n\nBallydung Manor may be reached by dialling Ballydung 666 from a telephone. In the earliest seasons of the show, the brothers' shared bedroom was the only part of the manor shown, but in later years, their kitchen was also used. This remained largely the case during the follow-up series ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show]]'', although the living room was featured in the ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show#New Year's Eve special|Bogmannay]]'' special on New Year's Eve 2006. The underground dungeon of Ballydung Manor was also shown in an episode of the chatshow when Podge and Rodge invited guest [[Sheana Keane]] to [[Features of The Podge and Rodge Show#Operation!|partake in a gruesome game of Operation!]].\n\nAnother location known to be in Ballydung is \"The Stickitt Inn\", which features on the chat show. Ballydung also has a bypass which was blocked off by a swarm of locusts on the Christmas Special of 2006, ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show#Christmas special|A Frightmare Before Christmas]]'', thus preventing any of the guests attending the show.\n\n==Television and radio shows==\n\n===''A Scare at Bedtime'' (1997\u20132006)===\n{{main article|A Scare at Bedtime}}\n''A Scare at Bedtime'' took its name from the nightly RT\u00c9 show called ''[[A Prayer at Bedtime]]'', which overlaid the text of a [[Roman Catholic]] prayer over serene images with [[choral music]] playing. A Scare at Bedtime, first aired in 1997, is close to being the polar opposite of this, with extremely adult content, lewd jokes and slightly obscene anecdotes being related by the two puppets. Their origins on the Den are largely ignored, as the backstory gradually established on A Scare at Bedtime, presents them to be both in their fifties (although they don't look any different from how they used to), and residing in [[Ballydung Manor]], the former Ballydung Asylum. Rumour has it that their parents left them in the asylum many years ago, and in revenge, Rodge took an axe to them both. But no bodies were ever found. They live with a lunatic nurse that they call \"Granny\" who practices the black arts (since she is dating Satan, whom they refer to as the \"quare fella\" throughout the series) and Pox the cat who suffers from rabies, the pox, and extreme violence at the hands of its two owners. Their hobbies include cockfighting and exorcisms of which Father Flange occasionally does special sessions. They have been given full names also: Padraig Judas O'Leprosy and Rodraig Spartacus O'Leprosy.\n\nEach episode follows the same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair would get into bed but in recent seasons they sit at the kitchen table. They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually insulting him. This leads Podge on to telling a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to [[masturbation]]. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.\n\n''[[A Scare at Bedtime]]'' never officially ended and the show has run to nine series as of January 2006, with the first five series available on DVD. An eight disc DVD box set of all nine seasons of 150 episodes (including fifty never for sale before) was released at Halloween 2010. The series has aired in both the UK and Ireland on [[RT\u00c9 Two]], [[Tara TV]], [[BBC]] [[UK Play]] and the [[Paramount Comedy Channel]]. ''A Scare at Bedtime'' was nominated in the Best Entertainment Programme category of the [[Irish Film and Television Academy Awards]] in both 1999 and 2000. Winning the [[Irish Film and Television Awards|IFTA]] for Best Entertainment Programme in 2000.\n\n===''Podge and Rodge's TV Bodges'' (2000)===\nIn 2000, Podge and Rodge hosted a series made up of ten eight-minute episodes entitled ''[[Podge & Rodge's TV Bodges]]'' for [[BBC Prime]]. It was a collection of TV mishaps akin to ''[[It'll be Alright on the Night]]''. The series was broadcast all over the world via [[BBC Worldwide]].\n\n===''Ballydung Radio'' (2000)===\nPodge and Rodge were commissioned by [[UK Play]] in 2000 to create a music/comedy hybrid show. 20 x 30min programmes were broadcast. Podge and Rodge hosted the series from their home made [[pirate radio]] studio set up in Ballydung Manor. The show featured pop videos of the moment in between comedy links performed by the duo.\n\n===RT\u00c9 Two relaunch (2004)===\nPodge and Rodge hosted the relaunch of Network 2 as RT\u00c9 Two in 2004.<ref name=\"Network 2 goes gay for ratings\"/> They introduced the night's television programming which consisted of ''[[Premier Soccer Saturday|The Premiership]]'' at 20:00 followed by a highlights reel of Network 2, new comedy sketch show ''[[Stew (TV series)|Stew]]'' at 21:30, a repeat broadcast of the final episode of ''[[Paths to Freedom]]'' and the television premiere of the film ''[[Spin the Bottle (2003 film)|Spin the Bottle]]''.<ref name=\"Network 2 goes gay for ratings\"/> The relaunch was part of an RT\u00c9 initiative to promote \"edgier\" and \"riskier\" viewing that would \"push the boundaries\", which included a [[Homosexuality|gay]] theme night.<ref name=\"Network 2 goes gay for ratings\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article486871.ece|title=Network 2 goes gay for ratings|date=26 September 2004|accessdate=30 July 2009|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London|first=Jan|last=Battles}}</ref>\n\n===''The Podge and Rodge Show'' (2006\u20132010)===\n{{main article|The Podge and Rodge Show}}\nFirst aired on 6 February 2006, '''''The Podge and Rodge Show''''' fulfilled the duo's main aim by being their first chatshow. It was co-hosted by [[Lucy Kennedy]] and airs at 22:30 on Monday and 22:50 on Tuesday nights on [[RT\u00c9 Two]]. The show has been a phenomenal ratings success, regularly getting over 400,000 viewers a show. It won \"Favourite Irish TV Show\" for two years in a row at the 2006 and 2007 [[TV Now Awards]]. It was also nominated for an [[IFTA Award]] for \"Best Entertainment Show 2007\" and won the award in 2008. The second series began on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] on 16 October 2006, with a month break in January before returning on 5 February 2007 and running until April 2007. A third series, began on 15 October 2007 and ran until 15 April 2008 with a month break in January. The fourth series kicked off on 20 October 2008 without Lucy Kennedy, who was replaced by weekly female guest hosts. The show again took a break over Christmas and returned on 9 February 2009 for a further 10-week run with [[Caroline Morahan]] as the new host until 14 April 2009. Which turned out to be the final episode of the series as it was announced that a new format ''[[Podge & Rodge's Stickit Inn]]'', a celebrity pub quiz would replace the chat show in the Autumn 2009 schedule. However, the show returned in the [[Stickit Inn]] pub set in 2010, and ran until 27 April 2010.\n\n;Christmas special\n:''For full article, see [[List of The Podge and Rodge Show episodes#Christmas special 2006|A Frightmare Before Christmas]]''\nPodge and Rodge hosted a special show from Ballydung Manor on 19 December 2006, entitled ''A Frightmare Before Christmas''. It celebrated Christmas from their perspective, a reality where none of the intended guests turned up, and imaginary scenarios where the worst possible guests did. In reality Podge and Rodge and Lucy were left in the darkness of Ballydung Manor as the thunder raged outside, imagining their nightmare guests.\n\n;New Year's Eve specials\n:''For full article, see [[List of The Podge and Rodge Show episodes#New Year's Eve special 2006|Bogmannay]]''\nPodge and Rodge rang in 2007 on 31 December in a special programme lasting over forty minutes instead of the usual thirty-minute format. The New Year's Eve show was called ''Bogmanay'' (a play on [[Hogmanay]]). It was broadcast on [[RT\u00c9 Two]] from 22:30.\n\nOn it the boys looked back at some of the highlights of their year. They also handed out their very own Feckin' Eejit of the Year Awards (FEEJITs) to celebrate the great tradition of Irish Feckin' Eejitry. There were nine nominees chosen from the worlds of TV, entertainment, sport and politics.\n\nGuests included [[Edele Lynch|Edele]] and [[Keavy Lynch]] of [[B*Witched]] fame, [[Mary Black]], [[Jason Donovan]] and [[Freddie Starr]] returned as the Ballydung Butler for the evening.\n\nSuch was the success of the original ''Bogmanay'', Podge and Rodge hosted a second ''Bogmanay'' to ring in 2008. It featured guests [[Miss Ireland]], Bl\u00e1thnaid McKenna and [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Frank Bruno]] as well as [[David Gest|Mr. Gest]] who was unable to be interviewed as Lucy Kennedy, venturing into his dressing room, discovered he had turned into an ape. Instead a number of previously unseen clips which were not allowed to be shown before midnight were shown, including some in which Lucy Kennedy swore. A number of \"Half- Arse Hero\" awards were handed out, although none of the recipients (who included [[Steve Staunton]]) were present to accept them.\n\n;People in Need Telethon 2007 special\nOn Friday 26 October 2007 for the [[People in Need Telethon]] Podge and Rodge finally got to interview their nemesis and ultimate rival, the then host of ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' and ''\"Ireland's [[Alan Partridge]]\"'' [[Pat Kenny]]. ''\"Do the words lamb and slaughter mean anything to you?\"'' He was asked: ''\"Does it get on your tits though when people are saying, Jaysus \u2013 Pat Kenny earns how much? He should be paying me to watch that shite!\"'' He was also asked: ''\"Where did the nickname Pat the Plank come from? Who came up with that beauty?\"'' Pat blamed it on [[Eamon Dunphy]]. ''\"Are you bored with the wood puns?\"'' they asked to which Pat jibed: ''\"In fairness lads I'm not the puppet round here.\"'' Then it was time for a quick game of \"Plankety Plank\" which featured author [[Patricia Cornwell]] \u2013 he'd forgotten her name; [[Dawn French]] \u2013 he'd told her he'd give her \u20ac10 not to get out of bed; [[Brigitte Nielsen]] \u2013 she'd forced him to dance live on TV. Comparing Pat's bike to [[Gay Byrne|Gaybo]]'s [[Harley-Davidson]] they asked: ''\"Did Fisher Price make that?\"'' And then it was back to [[Ryan Tubridy|Tubbicino, Teletubby]]...\n\n;Best of The Podge and Rodge Show\nFrom 21 July 2009, RT\u00c9 began showing a compilation of the best moments of the first three series of ''The Podge and Rodge Show''.

In 1861, ruler Maharaja Narendra Singh of Patiala principality had named this fort in Mahendergarh in honor of his son Mohinder Singh.
