Francis continued that Germany's most popular singer, [[Freddy Quinn]], often sold two to three million records per song, equivalent to about twelve million in the United States. Using this as the basis for her April 1960 recording, \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\", which had initially been written as a ballad, Francis convinced the songwriters to speed up the song's tempo and revive the innovative drum rhythm from [[Guy Mitchell|Guy Mitchell's]] 1959 hit recording \"[[Heartaches by the Number]]\", which had been a No. 1 in Germany in its German cover version \"Ich z\u00e4hle t\u00e4glich meine Sorgen\" for [[Peter Alexander (Austrian performer)|Peter Alexander]]. Although \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" became her first No. 1 on the US charts, and its B-side \"Jealous of you (Tango della Gelosia)\" became a huge hit in Italy, it failed to make any impression on the German charts.\n\nVeteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel penned a set of German lyrics, named \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" (which translates to \"Love is a strange game\"), which was subsequently recorded by several artists already established on the German market such as [[Siw Malmkvist]] \u2013 [[Vocal harmony|self-harmonizing]] as the Jolly Sisters \u2013 or the Honey Twins (a German duo despite their English name). When these versions also failed to score as hits, Francis decided to record the song in German herself contrary to her producers' wishes who had advised against it despite the fact that ''Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites'' had been such a huge success and she was currently planning a second Italian album as well as a Spanish album and an album in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. But Francis insisted on a German version of her own, and after some further friction between Francis herself, her producers and the managers of MGM Records, \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" was recorded in June 1960 with producer Arnold Maxin.\n\n===Release and chart success===\nWhen the recording was finished, MGM producers on both sides of the Atlantic renewed their doubts in the song. They believed the release would mean \"career suicide\"<ref>Connie Francis: ''Who's Sorry Now'', St. Martin's Press, London 1984</ref> for Francis in Europe. However, Francis's unusual contract with MGM Records guaranteed her unlimited control over the release of her recorded material, and she persisted.\n\nWhen executives of [[Polydor]], distribution partner of MGM Records in Germany, pointed out that German listeners wouldn't be able to understand Francis' vocals during the first verse for the lack of correct pronunciation, Francis agreed to delete the first verse from the recording. After that, \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" was finally released in an edited version.<ref>Jan Feddersen: ''Connie Francis'', supplement to 5 CD Boxed Set ''Lass mir die bunten Tr\u00e4ume'', Bear Family Records BCD 15 786 AH, Hambergen (Germany) 1994</ref>\n\nThe song peaked at No. 1 in Germany for two weeks, as it did in many other countries and Francis would have six more No. 1 hits on the German charts and fifteen Top 10 hits.<ref>[[:de:Connie Francis#deutsch]]</ref> \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" became the best-selling single of 1960 in West Germany, where the original English version of the song also reached No. 25. Contrary to popular belief, Francis did ''not'' record any further foreign language versions of \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\"; the German version is the only one recorded by herself although other artists have recorded further cover versions in various languages such as Portuguese, Swedish, or even Finnish.\n\nThe B-side of the single was \"Robot Man\" which had been a No. 2 for Francis on the UK charts earlier that year. Since it was an English-language recording, German audiences took almost no notice of it.\n\nThe unabridged version of \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" was released for the first time in 1964 in the U.S. on the album ''[[Connie Francis Sings German Favorites]]''.\n\n==Other versions==\n\"Little\" Jimmy Scott recorded it with Lionel Hampton's band in the 1950s. Already in 1960 [[Ernest Tubb]] had a No. 16 US country hit with his rendition of the song, produced by [[Owen Bradley]].\nDuring the very early 1960s, Broadway Record Label released a version of this song on an EP \u2013 45 rpm record that featured the vocals \"as sung by Popular Artists,\" none of which are listed. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngM9fxYUiBY</ref>\n\"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was remade in 1979 by [[Debby Boone]], who had previously had Top 20 C&W hits with her Connie Francis hit remakes \"[[My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own]]\" and \"[[Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart]]\"; however, Boone's version of \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" only reached No. 48 C&W. The song has also been an album cut for [[Lynn Anderson]], [[James Booker]], [[Pat Boone]],<ref>[http://www.annbreen.com/ Ann Breen]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierrahull.com/|title=Sierra Hull|work=Sierra Hull}}</ref> [[Margo (singer)|Margo]], [[Jody Miller]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[Sandy Posey]], [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Bobby Vee]].\n\nTranslated versions of the song include those made by [[Celly Campello]] ([[:pt:Celly Campello|pt]]) (in Portuguese as \"Algu\u00e9m \u00e9 bobo de algu\u00e9m\"), Marketta Joutsi and also Sinikka Lehtev\u00e4 (in Finnish as \"Pajunk\u00f6ytt\u00e4\") and [[Siw Malmkvist]] (in Swedish as \"Tunna skivor\" and in Danish as \"Den kolde skulder\"). The Czech rendering \"A\u017e na severn\u00ed p\u00f3l\" was recorded in 1962 as a duet by [[Yvetta Simonov\u00e1]] ([[:cs:Yvetta Simonov\u00e1|cs]]) and [[Milan Chladil]] ([[:cs:Milan Chladil|cs]]). An Icelandic version, \"Allir eru einhvers apaspil\", was recorded by [[Mar\u00eda Baldursd\u00f3ttir]], with lyrics written by [[R\u00fanar J\u00fal\u00edusson]] ([[:is:R\u00fanar J\u00fal\u00edusson|is]]).\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1960]]\n*[[List of number-one hits of 1960 (Germany)]]\n*[[List of number-one hits in Norway#1960|List of number-one hits in Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MetroLyrics song|connie-francis|everybodys-somebodys-fool}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n\n{{Connie Francis}}\n{{Debby Boone}}\n{{Michael Jackson songs}}\n\n[[Category:1960 singles]]\n[[Category:Connie Francis songs]]\n[[Category:Debby Boone songs]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Canada]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Germany]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Norway]]\n[[Category:Songs with lyrics by Howard Greenfield]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Jack Keller (songwriter)]]\n[[Category:Siw Malmkvist songs]]\n[[Category:1960 songs]]\n[[Category:MGM Records singles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel|the film|Darling (1961 film)}}\n{{Infobox song\n| name        = Everybody's Somebody's Fool\n| cover       = Everybody's_Somebody's_Fool_-_Connie_Francis.jpg\n| alt         =\n| type        = single\n| artist      = [[Connie Francis]]\n| album       =\n| B-side      = Jealous of You (Tango della Gelosia)\n| released    = April 7, 1960\n| format      = 45 rpm single\n| recorded    = 1960\n| studio      =\n| venue       =\n| genre       = [[Pop music|Pop]]\n| length      = {{Duration|m=2|s=37}}\n| label       = [[MGM Records|MGM]]\n| writer      = {{hlist|[[Jack Keller (songwriter)|Jack Keller]]|[[Howard Greenfield]]}}\n| producer    = Arnold Maxin\n| prev_title  = [[Mama (David Whitfield song)|Mama]]\n| prev_title2 = Teddy\n| prev_year   = 1960\n| next_title  = [[My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own]]\n| next_title2 = [[Malague\u00f1a (song)|Malague\u00f1a]]\n| next_year   = 1960\n}}\n\n\"'''Everybody's Somebody's Fool'''\" is a song written by [[Jack Keller (songwriter)|Jack Keller]] and [[Howard Greenfield]] that was a No. 1 hit for [[Connie Francis]] in 1960.

The first of Francis's three US No. 1's, \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was also ranked on the R&B chart at No. 2 and was the only one of Francis's major hits to cross over to the [[country music|C&W]] charts where it peaked at No. 24.\n\nA No. 5 hit in the UK, \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was No. 1 in Australia for three weeks in July 1960 and in South Africa ranked as the No. 15 hit for that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/78zuvx.htm|title=Song artist 64 \u2013 Connie Francis|publisher=}}</ref> \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was also No. 1 in Norway for eight weeks.\n\n{{col-begin|width=71%}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1960)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Canada ([[CHUM]] ''Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://chumtribute.com/60-06-27-chart.jpg CHUM Tribute Charts, June 27, 1960]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|France ([[IFOP]])<ref>http://infodisc.fr/Tubes_Artiste_Choisi.php</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|-\n{{singlechart|West Germany|26|artist=Connie Francis|song=Everybody Is Somebody's Fool|songid=25579|year=1960|accessdate=February 14, 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|3|artist=Connie Francis|song=Everybody Is Somebody's Fool}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=Lever%20hit%20parades&qyear=1960&qmonth=Aug&qweek=11-Aug-1960#n_view_location |title=Lever hit parades: 11-Aug-1960 |work=Flavour of New Zealand}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|1|artist=Connie Francis|song=Everybody Is Somebody's Fool}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|5|artist=Connie Francis |song=Everybody's Somebody's Fool}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Connie Francis}}\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===All-time charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Francis continued that Germany's most popular singer, [[Freddy Quinn]], often sold two to three million records per song, equivalent to about twelve million in the United States. Using this as the basis for her April 1960 recording, \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\", which had initially been written as a ballad, Francis convinced the songwriters to speed up the song's tempo and revive the innovative drum rhythm from [[Guy Mitchell|Guy Mitchell's]] 1959 hit recording \"[[Heartaches by the Number]]\", which had been a No. 1 in Germany in its German cover version \"Ich z\u00e4hle t\u00e4glich meine Sorgen\" for [[Peter Alexander (Austrian performer)|Peter Alexander]]. Although \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" became her first No. 1 on the US charts, and its B-side \"Jealous of you (Tango della Gelosia)\" became a huge hit in Italy, it failed to make any impression on the German charts.\n\nVeteran lyricist Ralph Maria Siegel penned a set of German lyrics, named \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" (which translates to \"Love is a strange game\"), which was subsequently recorded by several artists already established on the German market such as [[Siw Malmkvist]] \u2013 [[Vocal harmony|self-harmonizing]] as the Jolly Sisters \u2013 or the Honey Twins (a German duo despite their English name). When these versions also failed to score as hits, Francis decided to record the song in German herself contrary to her producers' wishes who had advised against it despite the fact that ''Connie Francis Sings Italian Favorites'' had been such a huge success and she was currently planning a second Italian album as well as a Spanish album and an album in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. But Francis insisted on a German version of her own, and after some further friction between Francis herself, her producers and the managers of MGM Records, \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" was recorded in June 1960 with producer Arnold Maxin.\n\n===Release and chart success===\nWhen the recording was finished, MGM producers on both sides of the Atlantic renewed their doubts in the song. They believed the release would mean \"career suicide\"<ref>Connie Francis: ''Who's Sorry Now'', St. Martin's Press, London 1984</ref> for Francis in Europe. However, Francis's unusual contract with MGM Records guaranteed her unlimited control over the release of her recorded material, and she persisted.\n\nWhen executives of [[Polydor]], distribution partner of MGM Records in Germany, pointed out that German listeners wouldn't be able to understand Francis' vocals during the first verse for the lack of correct pronunciation, Francis agreed to delete the first verse from the recording. After that, \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" was finally released in an edited version.<ref>Jan Feddersen: ''Connie Francis'', supplement to 5 CD Boxed Set ''Lass mir die bunten Tr\u00e4ume'', Bear Family Records BCD 15 786 AH, Hambergen (Germany) 1994</ref>\n\nThe song peaked at No. 1 in Germany for two weeks, as it did in many other countries and Francis would have six more No. 1 hits on the German charts and fifteen Top 10 hits.<ref>[[:de:Connie Francis#deutsch]]</ref> \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" became the best-selling single of 1960 in West Germany, where the original English version of the song also reached No. 25. Contrary to popular belief, Francis did ''not'' record any further foreign language versions of \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\"; the German version is the only one recorded by herself although other artists have recorded further cover versions in various languages such as Portuguese, Swedish, or even Finnish.\n\nThe B-side of the single was \"Robot Man\" which had been a No. 2 for Francis on the UK charts earlier that year. Since it was an English-language recording, German audiences took almost no notice of it.\n\nThe unabridged version of \"Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel\" was released for the first time in 1964 in the U.S. on the album ''[[Connie Francis Sings German Favorites]]''.\n\n==Other versions==\n\"Little\" Jimmy Scott recorded it with Lionel Hampton's band in the 1950s. Already in 1960 [[Ernest Tubb]] had a No. 16 US country hit with his rendition of the song, produced by [[Owen Bradley]].\nDuring the very early 1960s, Broadway Record Label released a version of this song on an EP \u2013 45 rpm record that featured the vocals \"as sung by Popular Artists,\" none of which are listed. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngM9fxYUiBY</ref>\n\"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was remade in 1979 by [[Debby Boone]], who had previously had Top 20 C&W hits with her Connie Francis hit remakes \"[[My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own]]\" and \"[[Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart]]\"; however, Boone's version of \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" only reached No. 48 C&W. The song has also been an album cut for [[Lynn Anderson]], [[James Booker]], [[Pat Boone]],<ref>[http://www.annbreen.com/ Ann Breen]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierrahull.com/|title=Sierra Hull|work=Sierra Hull}}</ref> [[Margo (singer)|Margo]], [[Jody Miller]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[Sandy Posey]], [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Kitty Wells]] and [[Bobby Vee]].\n\nTranslated versions of the song include those made by [[Celly Campello]] ([[:pt:Celly Campello|pt]]) (in Portuguese as \"Algu\u00e9m \u00e9 bobo de algu\u00e9m\"), Marketta Joutsi and also Sinikka Lehtev\u00e4 (in Finnish as \"Pajunk\u00f6ytt\u00e4\") and [[Siw Malmkvist]] (in Swedish as \"Tunna skivor\" and in Danish as \"Den kolde skulder\"). The Czech rendering \"A\u017e na severn\u00ed p\u00f3l\" was recorded in 1962 as a duet by [[Yvetta Simonov\u00e1]] ([[:cs:Yvetta Simonov\u00e1|cs]]) and [[Milan Chladil]] ([[:cs:Milan Chladil|cs]]). An Icelandic version, \"Allir eru einhvers apaspil\", was recorded by [[Mar\u00eda Baldursd\u00f3ttir]], with lyrics written by [[R\u00fanar J\u00fal\u00edusson]] ([[:is:R\u00fanar J\u00fal\u00edusson|is]]).\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1960]]\n*[[List of number-one hits of 1960 (Germany)]]\n*[[List of number-one hits in Norway#1960|List of number-one hits in Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MetroLyrics song|connie-francis|everybodys-somebodys-fool}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n\n{{Connie Francis}}\n{{Debby Boone}}\n{{Michael Jackson songs}}\n\n[[Category:1960 singles]]\n[[Category:Connie Francis songs]]\n[[Category:Debby Boone songs]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Canada]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Germany]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Norway]]\n[[Category:Songs with lyrics by Howard Greenfield]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Jack Keller (songwriter)]]\n[[Category:Siw Malmkvist songs]]\n[[Category:1960 songs]]\n[[Category:MGM Records singles]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toChum(link changed toCHUM Chart) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody%27s_Somebody%27s_Fool"}

After taking a farm animal from the collaborationist headman (Sergei Yakovlev), they head back to their unit, but are spotted by a German patrol. After a protracted gunfight in the snow in which one of the Germans is killed, the two men get away, but Sotnikov ([[Boris Plotnikov]]) is shot in the leg. Rybak ([[Vladimir Gostyukhin]]) has to take him to the nearest shelter, the home of Demchikha ([[Lyudmila Polyakova]]), the mother of three young children. However, they are discovered and captured.\n\nThe two men and a sobbing Demchikha are taken to the German headquarters. Sotnikov is interrogated first by local collaborator Portnov ([[Anatoli Solonitsyn]]), a former Soviet [[Palace of Culture|club-house]] director and children's choirmaster who became the local head of the [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police]], loyal to the Germans. When Sotnikov refuses to answer Portnov's questions, he is brutally tortured by members of the collaborationist police, but gives up no information. However, Rybak tells as much as he thinks the police already know, hoping to live so he can escape later. Portnov offers him the job of policeman. The headman, now suspected of supporting the partisans, and Basya Meyer, the teen daughter of a Jewish shoemaker, are imprisoned in the same cellar for the night.\n\nThe next morning, all are led out to be hanged. Rybak accepts Portnov's offer and the Germans let him join the police. Sotnikov and the others are executed.\n\nAs he heads back to the camp with his new comrades, Rybak is vilified by the villagers. Realizing what he has done, he tries to hang himself in the outhouse with his belt, but fails. A fellow policeman calls for Rybak until Rybak opens the door. The policeman tells him that their commander wants him and leaves him alone in the courtyard. Rybak stares out the open door and begins to laugh and weep. He feels utter anguish, just as [[Judas]] did after betraying [[Jesus]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Boris Plotnikov]] as Sotnikov\n* [[Vladimir Gostyukhin]] as Rybak\n* [[Sergei Yakovlev (actor)|Sergei Yakovlev]] as Village elder\n* [[Lyudmila Polyakova]] as Demchikha\n* [[Viktoriya Goldentul]] as Basya Meyer\n* [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]] as Portnov, the collaborationist interrogator\n* [[Maria Vinogradova (actress)|Maria Vinogradova]] as Village elder's wife\n* [[Nikolai Sektimenko]] as Stas'\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{Quote|text=\nAll motion pictures are personal but the desire to film ''The Ascent'' was almost a physical need.

Production took place under an atmosphere of severe stress. Technical and organizational difficulties led to the necessity of calling an ambulance for the director's health. The release of the film was not any easier; the censors deleted critical scenes and Shepitko had to fight for every single one of them. This struggle was not always successful. Despite the fact that the film was one of the prize winners at the [[Venice Film Festival]], the removed scenes were a terrible blow to Shepitko, who believed that changing an important moment leads to the loss of main ideas.<ref name=horoshee />\n\nFor Shepitko it was a difficult time after the film's release. By her own admission, for a period of four months the director was in \"a monstrous mental and physical exhaustion.\" The realization of what was subsequently necessary came to her suddenly while she was recuperating at a [[Sochi]] [[sanatorium]], but her creative plans were undermined by a disastrous fall, which resulted in a serious concussion and a spinal injury. For a few weeks Shepitko was confined to bed. The situation was also aggravated by the fact that she was pregnant, but she felt that during her pregnancy she came to understand the complexities of life more fully. Every day she was haunted by the possibility of death; reading the novel ''Sotnikov'' by [[Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d]] during this period helped Shepitko express this state on the silver screen.<ref name=horoshee>{{cite web|url=http://www.horosheekino.ru/voskhozhdenie.htm|script-title = ru:\u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439 \u0428\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e|author=\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0425\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|accessdate=2013-05-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419215851/http://www.horosheekino.ru/voskhozhdenie.htm|archivedate=2015-04-19|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\nFor the most part the screenplay written by [[Yuri Klepikov]] follows the novel. Shepitko turned to Klepikov on the recommendation of her classmate Natalia Ryazantseva but he was already busy working on another script. Klepikov did not refuse the commission, but he asked to postpone working on ''The Ascent'' for a week. Shepitko urged him to start work immediately and a single telephone conversation with her convinced him to drop everything he was doing. Klepikov, by his own admission, \"could not withstand the energy of the typhoon whose name was Larisa,\" and started the task of revising the literary foundation which he later described as \"a piping philosophical parable which combined the high spirit of man with his obvious desire to keep the body as a receptacle of the spirit.\"{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=93}} The result of the work became a 70-page script that Shepitko then meticulously edited.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=93}}<ref name=rus>{{cite web|publisher=\u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|script-title = ru:\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (1976)|url=http://2011.russiancinema.ru/index.php?e_dept_id=2&e_movie_id=1110|language=Russian}}</ref> Shepitko practised the \"engineer's\" approach: she did not tolerate uncertainty or haziness in work and did not rely on director's improvisation or creative inspiration. Every frame, every remark, every scene was carefully checked and planned in advance. According to Yuri Klepikov even \"the fruitful spontaneity was due to the very environment of the shoot,\" which was ensured by the carefully crafted script.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=94}}{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=95}}\n\nWhen adapting the script from ''Sotnikov'' the main concern of the director was not to lose the deeper philosophical content of the story. While the literary work by B\u00fdka\u016d was full of sensual details like \"icy cold\", \"famine\", \"danger\", Shepitko strongly discouraged attempts to be satisfied with external action and demanded an \"internal justification\" of each movement, gesture and glance of the heroes. In order to express the spiritual states she often had to deviate from the literary basis. For example, in the finale of the original story Rybak decides to hang himself in the latrine but discovers that he forgot to ask for the belt back which had been taken by the policemen an evening before. Theoretically, the film could portray the absence of the belt, but then - according to the writers - the scene would be limited to the designation of the circumstances: informative but unimpressive denial in terms of the artistic sense. The authors \"returned\" the belt to Rybak but he was deprived of the ability to hang himself; implying that even death refuses a traitor. Their idea was to leave Rybak alone with the knowledge of his fall. The following long close-up of majestic nature signified the freedom which Rybak desperately desires and was intended to emphasize the utmost despair \"of a person who lost himself.\"{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=94}}\n\nShepitko's husband [[Elem Klimov]] suggested the film's title. Long before, in 1963, a tradition was established between the future spouses that for a good idea they would receive ten roubles. When they just started dating, Klimov came up with the name for Shepitko's thesis film \u2013 ''Heat''. Shepitko and Klimov decided to continue this playful approach of rewarding each other but after all the years of their union Klimov alone received the ten rouble reward and only twice: for ''Heat'' and for ''The Ascent''.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=18}}\n\n===Beginning of Production===\nThe next step was the need for the script's approval from the [[State Committee for Cinematography]].

Firsova was an administrator of an association of military-patriotic films. She was affected much more by the script than by the novel and the day she met Shepitko, she went to the meet the Minister of Cinematography Philippe Ermash. In a conversation with Ermash's replacement (in her memoirs Firsova did not call Boris Pavlenok by his name), Firsova said that she took the script under her responsibility, with a lie that \"everything will be fine with the State Political Directorate.\" Ermash's replacement reacted skeptically to the pleas, and the subsequent process from script approval to acceptance of the film's actors was accompanied by considerable difficulties. The main accusation was that Shepitko allegedly made a \"religious parable with a mystical tone\" from the partisan story; this was considered an insurrection in the atheistic Soviet cinema.<ref name=durov /> Shepitko retorted that she was not religious and that a story about betrayal was antediluvian.

Because of this, she had to reject [[Andrey Myagkov]] who really wanted to act in the picture. The same fate befell Nikolai Gubenko. [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], who yearned to play Rybakov, and because of that was jealous of the other candidates, also did not pass selection. At the time when the castings for ''The Ascent'' were taking place, Vysotsky was starring in the film ''[[The Negro of Peter the Great]]''. Production of that film took place at the \"Mosfilm\" sound stage, adjacent to where the auditions were being held, and during his breaks Vysotsky often went to see what was happening at Shepitko's sound stage.<ref name=teatral />\n\nFrom the beginning of the search for the actor who would play Sotnikov, Larisa Shepitko instructed Emma Baskakova, her casting assistant, to keep in mind the image of Christ; although it was impossible to mention this out loud.<ref name=horoshee /> Boris Plotnikov, a 25-year-old actor of the Sverdlovsk Theater, turned out to be the best candidate for the role according to the director; but the officials of Goskino saw in Shepitko's plan the intention to \"drag Jesus on to the Soviet screen.\" Plotnikov, whose repertoire until then largely included the roles of magical animals,<ref name=gost-bio /> even had to be made up for the purpose of greater glorification of the character so that the artistic council would approve him for the role. The actor went through seven test shots altogether for which he always had to fly to Moscow from Sverdlovsk.<ref name=gordon />\n\nFor the role of Rybak the director screened twenty candidates. The twenty-first applicant for the role was the young, unknown actor [[Vladimir Gostyukhin]].<ref name=rus /> Gostyukhin, who had worked for six years in the Soviet Army theater as a furniture and prop maker, had once replaced a sick actor in the play ''Unknown Soldier''; his performance was noticed by Svetlana Klimova, who was the [[second unit]] director for Vasiliy Ordynski. Gostyukhin received an invitation to act in the series ''The Road to Calvary'', where he played the role of the anarchist and bandit Krasilnikov for whom charisma and a strong temperament were required. It was while working that set that he was noticed by Larisa Shepitko's assistants. Gostyukhin was invited to audition for the role of Rybak, but initially could not equate \"a woman of great beauty [Sheptiko] with the super-masculine, tough and tragic story by Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d.\" But after a 20-minute conversation with the director, he was convinced that only she could film the adaptation of this weighty book. Even so, Shepitko initially had doubts about the candidate, who even with his actor's training, was still only a stage laborer. Plotnikov had immediately attracted the director with his constitution, smile, look and plasticity while Gostyukhin's appearance did not coincide with how Shepitko saw Rybak: the young actor came to his audition with \"frivolous\" bangs which were uncharacteristic for a partisan. Gostyukhin's rude manners initially alienated other members of the selection committee but Shepitko explained away his behavior as shyness and decided to audition the candidate who had already at the first rehearsal made a strong impression on everyone with his dedication in realizing the character.<ref name=teatral>{{cite web|url=http://www.teatral-online.ru/news/4411/|script-title = ru:\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u0445\u0438\u043d: \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430|publisher=\u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b|date=2011-07-21|accessdate=2013-06-04|author=\u0410\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305060218/http://www.teatral-online.ru/news/4411/|archivedate=2016-03-05|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=gost-bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.russkoekino.ru/books/star/star-0001.shtml|script-title=ru:\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u0445\u0438\u043d. \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f|publisher=\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|accessdate=2013-06-04|author=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u044e\u0440\u0438\u043d|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426102338/http://russkoekino.ru/books/star/star-0001.shtml|archivedate=2013-04-26|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe actor for the role of Portnov was selected based on the image of Sotnikov. Larisa Shepitko wanted to find someone similar in external characteristics to Plotnikov, saying, \"They are similar, but Portnov is an antipode to Sotnikov based on internal beliefs. This should be a very good actor. Their duel, yes, yes, the fight with Sotnikov - the eternal conflict, the everlasting battle between spirit and lack of spirituality ... Dying, suffering Sotnikov wins because he is strong in spirit. He dies and rises above his tormentor.\"\n\nAnatoly Solonitsyn at first did not see anything interesting in what he thought of as a \"supporting role\", and which he considered a \"rehash\" of what had been filmed earlier. Initially, the actor did not even understand what was wanted of him despite the fact that he diligently played the \"enemy,\" a \"man with a bruised heart,\" or a \"man without a future\" as was required. But he felt that the character would turn out to be little but a caricature, as in cheap popular literature.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=62}}{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=63}} Only a long conversation with the director allowed him to understand her vision of Portnov: the personification of the negative side in the eternal history of man's struggle with the animal inside himself in the name of the supreme value \u2013 namely, the value of the spirit. The director insisted that the [[Great Patriotic War]] was won by the Soviet people because of their high level of awareness, so Portnov's \"anti-hero\" role was especially important because the character was supposed to emphasize the superiority of the human spirit's power over matter.<ref name=horoshee />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on Jan. 6, 1974 \u2013 the birthday of the director Shepitko (according to other sources filming began on January 5{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=50}}) - in the vicinity of the town of [[Murom]]. The first scenes were shot on location in the middle of fields, forests and ravines despite the fact that the weather was forty degrees below zero. According to Boris Plotnikov the frost and the virginal snow were mandatory conditions which Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d had set out in his story.<ref name=gordon /> This approach was endorsed by Larisa Shepitko, according to whom the actors had to \"feel the winter all the way down to their very cells\" for a more reliable way of entering the character.<ref name=horoshee /> Together with this, the filming process was planned in such a way that the actors started with the easiest acting in the psychological sense, and scenes which allowed them to gradually sink into their characters.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=51}}\n\nFrom the outset Shepitko managed to inspire every co-worker with her idea; they understood the film to be about sacred things: motherland, higher values, conscience, duty and spiritual heroism. Her ability to enthral her colleagues had already manifested before: Yuri Vizbor (lead actor in the movie ''You and I'') said: \"We worked for Larisa, specifically, personally for her. She had faith and that was the reason. Faith in goodness and the need for our work, and it is this faith that was absolutely a material substance, which can be very real to rely on.\"\n\nIn the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained. Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \"Stop! Cut!\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \"It was worth it \u201cto die\u201d in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before ''The Ascent'', Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie ''Heat''. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks.<ref name=\"trud\" /> Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of ''The Ascent''. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her strength throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To avoid hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them.<ref name=\"sneg\" /> With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bulvar.com.ua/arch/2013/1/50df47e8afa96/|script-title=ru:\u0418 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c, \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0451\u0437\u044b, \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c|publisher=\u0411\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430|accessdate=2013-05-31|date=2013-01-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627024052/http://www.bulvar.com.ua/arch/2013/1/50df47e8afa96/|archivedate=2013-06-27|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref><!-- \u0410\u0418:\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438-->\n\nIn order to achieve the desired performance from the actors, Shepitko sometimes talked for a long time with them out in the cold. For example, despite the crew's full readiness, the director would talk for a long time with Boris Plotnikov, whose character she carefully directed during the filming. Shepitko's habit of clearly stating her thoughts contributed to a successful transmission of information; she always avoided abstruse terms that might mask the lack of clarity. {{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=41}} She waited for the necessary expression of emotion, for the right facial expression and gestures and then suddenly would give the order to start filming. Boris Plotnikov later said that he would have liked to repeat this experience in other films, but never did. On working with Shepitko, Plotnikov spoke of \"a meeting with a living genius.\" Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d also shared a similar opinion about the film's director, he called her \"[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoevsky]] in a skirt.\" B\u00fdka\u016d valued Larisa Shepitko very highly and once admitted that had he met her before, he would have written ''Sotnikov'' differently.<ref name=gordon />\n\nVladimir Gostyukhin described the filming process not as acting but as \"death in every frame.\" For him and Plotnikov it was extremely important to validate the director's trust, since she had needed to defend their casting choices long and hard in front of the Soviet film authorities. Gostyukhin spoke of Shepitko's ability to convey an idea to the actors, akin to [[hypnosis]], under which he with Plotnikov - the newcomers to the film studio - could produce the \"miracle of transformation.\" During the first rehearsal Shepitko even sprayed their faces with snow. By the latter's suggestion it was done to collect their attention and will and also to give texture and credibility to their characters.

The chances were very high that the film would be shelved, until Elem Klimov (the husband of Larisa Shepitko and also a film director by profession) decided to take a desperate step. While Klimov was preparing for the shooting of the film ''Kill Hitler'' (which was released under the title of ''[[Come and See]]'' in 1985), he met with [[Pyotr Masherov]], the first secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus, who strongly supported the director and even acted as a historical consultant.

At the end of the film, Masherov - contrary to tradition (usually at such premieres opinions were heard first from the lower ranks and then from the highest) - came on stage and spoke for about forty minutes.

After taking a farm animal from the collaborationist headman (Sergei Yakovlev), they head back to their unit, but are spotted by a German patrol. After a protracted gunfight in the snow in which one of the Germans is killed, the two men get away, but Sotnikov ([[Boris Plotnikov]]) is shot in the leg. Rybak ([[Vladimir Gostyukhin]]) has to take him to the nearest shelter, the home of Demchikha ([[Lyudmila Polyakova]]), the mother of three young children. However, they are discovered and captured.\n\nThe two men and a sobbing Demchikha are taken to the German headquarters. Sotnikov is interrogated first by local collaborator Portnov ([[Anatoli Solonitsyn]]), a former Soviet [[Palace of Culture|club-house]] director and children's choirmaster who became the local head of the [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police]], loyal to the Germans. When Sotnikov refuses to answer Portnov's questions, he is brutally tortured by members of the collaborationist police, but gives up no information. However, Rybak tells as much as he thinks the police already know, hoping to live so he can escape later. Portnov offers him the job of policeman. The headman, now suspected of supporting the partisans, and Basya Meyer, the teen daughter of a Jewish shoemaker, are imprisoned in the same cellar for the night.\n\nThe next morning, all are led out to be hanged. Rybak accepts Portnov's offer and the Germans let him join the police. Sotnikov and the others are executed.\n\nAs he heads back to the camp with his new comrades, Rybak is vilified by the villagers. Realizing what he has done, he tries to hang himself in the outhouse with his belt, but fails. A fellow policeman calls for Rybak until Rybak opens the door. The policeman tells him that their commander wants him and leaves him alone in the courtyard. Rybak stares out the open door and begins to laugh and weep. He feels utter anguish, just as [[Judas]] did after betraying [[Jesus]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Boris Plotnikov]] as Sotnikov\n* [[Vladimir Gostyukhin]] as Rybak\n* [[Sergei Yakovlev (actor)|Sergei Yakovlev]] as Village elder\n* [[Lyudmila Polyakova]] as Demchikha\n* [[Viktoriya Goldentul]] as Basya Meyer\n* [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]] as Portnov, the collaborationist interrogator\n* [[Maria Vinogradova (actress)|Maria Vinogradova]] as Village elder's wife\n* [[Nikolai Sektimenko]] as Stas'\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{Quote|text=\nAll motion pictures are personal but the desire to film ''The Ascent'' was almost a physical need.

Production took place under an atmosphere of severe stress. Technical and organizational difficulties led to the necessity of calling an ambulance for the director's health. The release of the film was not any easier; the censors deleted critical scenes and Shepitko had to fight for every single one of them. This struggle was not always successful. Despite the fact that the film was one of the prize winners at the [[Venice Film Festival]], the removed scenes were a terrible blow to Shepitko, who believed that changing an important moment leads to the loss of main ideas.<ref name=horoshee />\n\nFor Shepitko it was a difficult time after the film's release. By her own admission, for a period of four months the director was in \"a monstrous mental and physical exhaustion.\" The realization of what was subsequently necessary came to her suddenly while she was recuperating at a [[Sochi]] [[sanatorium]], but her creative plans were undermined by a disastrous fall, which resulted in a serious concussion and a spinal injury. For a few weeks Shepitko was confined to bed. The situation was also aggravated by the fact that she was going to become a mother, but it was during her pregnancy that she came to an astute understanding of life in its whole complexity. Every day she was haunted by the possibility of death; reading the novel ''Sotnikov'' by [[Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d]] during this period helped Shepitko express this state on the silver screen.<ref name=horoshee>{{cite web|url=http://www.horosheekino.ru/voskhozhdenie.htm|script-title = ru:\u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439 \u0428\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e|author=\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0425\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|accessdate=2013-05-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419215851/http://www.horosheekino.ru/voskhozhdenie.htm|archivedate=2015-04-19|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\nFor the most part the screenplay written by [[Yuri Klepikov]] follows the novel. Shepitko turned to Klepikov on the recommendation of her classmate Natalia Ryazantseva but he was already busy working on another script. Klepikov did not refuse the commission, but he asked to postpone working on ''The Ascent'' for a week. Shepitko urged him to start work immediately and a single telephone conversation with her convinced him to drop everything he was doing. Klepikov, by his own admission, \"could not withstand the energy of the typhoon whose name was Larisa,\" and started the task of revising the literary foundation which he later described as \"a piping philosophical parable which combined the high spirit of man with his obvious desire to keep the body as a receptacle of the spirit.\"{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=93}} The result of the work became a 70-page script that Shepitko then meticulously edited.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=93}}<ref name=rus>{{cite web|publisher=\u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|script-title = ru:\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (1976)|url=http://2011.russiancinema.ru/index.php?e_dept_id=2&e_movie_id=1110|language=Russian}}</ref> Shepitko practised the \"engineer's\" approach: she did not tolerate uncertainty or haziness in work and did not rely on director's improvisation or creative inspiration. Every frame, every remark, every scene was carefully checked and planned in advance. According to Yuri Klepikov even \"the fruitful spontaneity was due to the very environment of the shoot,\" which was ensured by the carefully crafted script.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=94}}{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=95}}\n\nWhen adapting the script from ''Sotnikov'' the main concern of the director was not to lose the deeper philosophical content of the story. While the literary work by B\u00fdka\u016d was full of sensual details like \"icy cold\", \"famine\", \"danger\", Shepitko strongly discouraged attempts to be satisfied with external action and demanded an \"internal justification\" of each movement, gesture and glance of the heroes. In order to express the spiritual states she often had to deviate from the literary basis. For example, in the finale of the original story Rybak decides to hang himself in the latrine but discovers that he forgot to ask for the belt back which had been taken by the policemen an evening before. Theoretically, the film could portray the absence of the belt, but then - according to the writers - the scene would be limited to the designation of the circumstances: informative but unimpressive denial in terms of the artistic sense. The authors \"returned\" the belt to Rybak but he was deprived of the ability to hang himself; implying that even death refuses a traitor. Their idea was to leave Rybak alone with the knowledge of his fall. The following long close-up of majestic nature signified the freedom which Rybak desperately desires and was intended to emphasize the utmost despair \"of a person who lost himself.\"{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=94}}\n\nShepitko's husband [[Elem Klimov]] suggested the film's title. Long before, in 1963, a tradition was established between the future spouses that for a good idea they would receive ten roubles. When they just started dating, Klimov came up with the name for Shepitko's thesis film \u2013 ''Heat''. Shepitko and Klimov decided to continue this playful approach of rewarding each other but after all the years of their union Klimov alone received the ten rouble reward and only twice: for ''Heat'' and for ''The Ascent''.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=18}}\n\n===Beginning of Production===\nThe next step was the need for the script's approval from the [[State Committee for Cinematography]]. By that time Shepitko had already gained a reputation of an \"inconvenient\" director; back in 1973, when she only raised the topic of making the film, the answer from an official of the State Committee for Cinematography was a firm negative.<ref name=durov>{{cite web|url=http://www.levdurov.ru/show_arhive.php?id=1200|script-title = ru:\u0413\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0451\u0440\u0430 \u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044b \u0428\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e|publisher=\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430|accessdate=2013-05-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622032417/http://www.levdurov.ru/show_arhive.php?id=1200|archivedate=2013-06-22|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref> The director did not spark a confrontation but she also did not offer any other projects.<ref name=horoshee /> Throughout her directing career Shepitko only started working on a film if she felt that \"if she does not do it, then she dies.\"<ref name=ist>{{cite web|url=http://istoriya-kino.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000015/st002.shtml|script-title = ru:\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435|author=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0443\u043a|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|accessdate=2013-05-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211212307/http://istoriya-kino.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000015/st002.shtml|archivedate=2012-12-11|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFor help in overcoming the resistance of the authorities and the [[State Political Directorate]], Shepitko turned to Gemma Firsova with whom she had studied at [[VGIK]]. Firsova was an administrator of an association of military-patriotic films. She was affected much more by the script than by the novel and the day she met Shepitko, she went to the meet the Minister of Cinematography Philippe Ermash. In a conversation with Ermash's replacement (in her memoirs Firsova did not call Boris Pavlenok by his name), Firsova said that she took the script under her responsibility, with a lie that \"everything will be fine with the State Political Directorate.\" Ermash's replacement reacted skeptically to the pleas, and the subsequent process from script approval to acceptance of the film's actors was accompanied by considerable difficulties. The main accusation was that Shepitko allegedly made a \"religious parable with a mystical tone\" from the partisan story; this was considered an insurrection in the atheistic Soviet cinema.<ref name=durov /> Shepitko retorted that she was not religious and that a story about betrayal was antediluvian. According to her, Judas and Jesus had always existed and that if the legend connected with people then this means that it was alive in every person.<ref name=horoshee /> Officials met Schnittke's score with resistance and they ordered that the allusions to biblical texts be removed.<ref name=firsova>{{cite web|url=http://kinoart.ru/archive/2006/12/n12-article13|script-title=ru:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e \u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0435 \u0428\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e|date=December 2006|accessdate=2013-05-31|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|author=Gemma Firsova|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317082025/http://kinoart.ru/archive/2006/12/n12-article13|archivedate=2013-03-17|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom the moment she read the story ''Sotnikov'', it took Larisa Shepitko four years to prepare and to obtain permits from the authorities to begin shooting the picture.<ref name=sneg />\n\n===Casting===\n\nShepitko decided to use unknown or little-known actors whose past roles would not cast a shadow on their characters in ''The Ascent''. Because of this, she had to reject [[Andrey Myagkov]] who really wanted to act in the picture. The same fate befell Nikolai Gubenko. [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], who yearned to play Rybakov, and because of that was jealous of the other candidates, also did not pass selection. At the time when the castings for ''The Ascent'' were taking place, Vysotsky was starring in the film ''[[The Negro of Peter the Great]]''. Production of that film took place at the \"Mosfilm\" sound stage, adjacent to where the auditions were being held, and during his breaks Vysotsky often went to see what was happening at Shepitko's sound stage.<ref name=teatral />\n\nFrom the beginning of the search for the actor who would play Sotnikov, Larisa Shepitko instructed Emma Baskakova, her casting assistant, to keep in mind the image of Christ; although it was impossible to mention this out loud.<ref name=horoshee /> Boris Plotnikov, a 25-year-old actor of the Sverdlovsk Theater, turned out to be the best candidate for the role according to the director; but the officials of Goskino saw in Shepitko's plan the intention to \"drag Jesus on to the Soviet screen.\" Plotnikov, whose repertoire until then largely included the roles of magical animals,<ref name=gost-bio /> even had to be made up for the purpose of greater glorification of the character so that the artistic council would approve him for the role. The actor went through seven test shots altogether for which he always had to fly to Moscow from Sverdlovsk.<ref name=gordon />\n\nFor the role of Rybak the director screened twenty candidates. The twenty-first applicant for the role was the young, unknown actor [[Vladimir Gostyukhin]].<ref name=rus /> Gostyukhin, who had worked for six years in the Soviet Army theater as a furniture and prop maker, had once replaced a sick actor in the play ''Unknown Soldier''; his performance was noticed by Svetlana Klimova, who was the [[second unit]] director for Vasiliy Ordynski. Gostyukhin received an invitation to act in the series ''The Road to Calvary'', where he played the role of the anarchist and bandit Krasilnikov for whom charisma and a strong temperament were required. It was while working that set that he was noticed by Larisa Shepitko's assistants. Gostyukhin was invited to audition for the role of Rybak, but initially could not equate \"a woman of great beauty [Sheptiko] with the super-masculine, tough and tragic story by Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d.\" But after a 20-minute conversation with the director, he was convinced that only she could film the adaptation of this weighty book. Even so, Shepitko initially had doubts about the candidate, who even with his actor's training, was still only a stage laborer. Plotnikov had immediately attracted the director with his constitution, smile, look and plasticity while Gostyukhin's appearance did not coincide with how Shepitko saw Rybak: the young actor came to his audition with \"frivolous\" bangs which were uncharacteristic for a partisan. Gostyukhin's rude manners initially alienated other members of the selection committee but Shepitko explained away his behavior as shyness and decided to audition the candidate who had already at the first rehearsal made a strong impression on everyone with his dedication in realizing the character.<ref name=teatral>{{cite web|url=http://www.teatral-online.ru/news/4411/|script-title = ru:\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u0445\u0438\u043d: \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430|publisher=\u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b|date=2011-07-21|accessdate=2013-06-04|author=\u0410\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305060218/http://www.teatral-online.ru/news/4411/|archivedate=2016-03-05|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=gost-bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.russkoekino.ru/books/star/star-0001.shtml|script-title=ru:\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u0445\u0438\u043d. \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f|publisher=\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|accessdate=2013-06-04|author=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u044e\u0440\u0438\u043d|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426102338/http://russkoekino.ru/books/star/star-0001.shtml|archivedate=2013-04-26|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe actor for the role of Portnov was selected based on the image of Sotnikov. Larisa Shepitko wanted to find someone similar in external characteristics to Plotnikov, saying, \"They are similar, but Portnov is an antipode to Sotnikov based on internal beliefs. This should be a very good actor. Their duel, yes, yes, the fight with Sotnikov - the eternal conflict, the everlasting battle between spirit and lack of spirituality ... Dying, suffering Sotnikov wins because he is strong in spirit. He dies and rises above his tormentor.\"\n\nAnatoly Solonitsyn at first did not see anything interesting in what he thought of as a \"supporting role\", and which he considered a \"rehash\" of what had been filmed earlier. Initially, the actor did not even understand what was wanted of him despite the fact that he diligently played the \"enemy,\" a \"man with a bruised heart,\" or a \"man without a future\" as was required. But he felt that the character would turn out to be little but a caricature, as in cheap popular literature.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=62}}{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=63}} Only a long conversation with the director allowed him to understand her vision of Portnov: the personification of the negative side in the eternal history of man's struggle with the animal inside himself in the name of the supreme value \u2013 namely, the value of the spirit. The director insisted that the [[Great Patriotic War]] was won by the Soviet people because of their high level of awareness, so Portnov's \"anti-hero\" role was especially important because the character was supposed to emphasize the superiority of the human spirit's power over matter.<ref name=horoshee />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on Jan. 6, 1974 \u2013 the birthday of the director Shepitko (according to other sources filming began on January 5{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=50}}) - in the vicinity of the town of [[Murom]]. The first scenes were shot on location in the middle of fields, forests and ravines despite the fact that the weather was forty degrees below zero. According to Boris Plotnikov the frost and the virginal snow were mandatory conditions which Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d had set out in his story.<ref name=gordon /> This approach was endorsed by Larisa Shepitko, according to whom the actors had to \"feel the winter all the way down to their very cells\" for a more reliable way of entering the character.<ref name=horoshee /> Together with this, the filming process was planned in such a way that the actors started with the easiest acting in the psychological sense, and scenes which allowed them to gradually sink into their characters.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=51}}\n\nFrom the outset Shepitko managed to inspire every co-worker with her idea; they understood the film to be about sacred things: motherland, higher values, conscience, duty and spiritual heroism. Her ability to enthral her colleagues had already manifested before: Yuri Vizbor (lead actor in the movie ''You and I'') said: \"We worked for Larisa, specifically, personally for her. She had faith and that was the reason. Faith in goodness and the need for our work, and it is this faith that was absolutely a material substance, which can be very real to rely on.\"\n\nIn the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained. Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \"Stop! Cut!\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \"It was worth it \u201cto die\u201d in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before ''The Ascent'', Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie ''Heat''. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks.<ref name=\"trud\" /> Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of ''The Ascent''. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her strength throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To avoid hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them.<ref name=\"sneg\" /> With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bulvar.com.ua/arch/2013/1/50df47e8afa96/|script-title=ru:\u0418 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c, \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0451\u0437\u044b, \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c|publisher=\u0411\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430|accessdate=2013-05-31|date=2013-01-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627024052/http://www.bulvar.com.ua/arch/2013/1/50df47e8afa96/|archivedate=2013-06-27|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref><!-- \u0410\u0418:\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438-->\n\nIn order to achieve the desired performance from the actors, Shepitko sometimes talked for a long time with them out in the cold. For example, despite the crew's full readiness, the director would talk for a long time with Boris Plotnikov, whose character she carefully directed during the filming. Shepitko's habit of clearly stating her thoughts contributed to a successful transmission of information; she always avoided abstruse terms that might mask the lack of clarity. {{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=41}} She waited for the necessary expression of emotion, for the right facial expression and gestures and then suddenly would give the order to start filming. Boris Plotnikov later said that he would have liked to repeat this experience in other films, but never did. On working with Shepitko, Plotnikov spoke of \"a meeting with a living genius.\" Vasil B\u00fdka\u016d also shared a similar opinion about the film's director, he called her \"[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoevsky]] in a skirt.\" B\u00fdka\u016d valued Larisa Shepitko very highly and once admitted that had he met her before, he would have written ''Sotnikov'' differently.<ref name=gordon />\n\nVladimir Gostyukhin described the filming process not as acting but as \"death in every frame.\" For him and Plotnikov it was extremely important to validate the director's trust, since she had needed to defend their casting choices long and hard in front of the Soviet film authorities. Gostyukhin spoke of Shepitko's ability to convey an idea to the actors, akin to [[hypnosis]], under which he with Plotnikov - the newcomers to the film studio - could produce the \"miracle of transformation.\" During the first rehearsal Shepitko even sprayed their faces with snow. By the latter's suggestion it was done to collect their attention and will and also to give texture and credibility to their characters. Later it became a kind of ritual, often preceding the next take on the film set.<ref name=sneg>{{cite web|url=http://istoriya-kino.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000015/st003.shtml|script-title=ru:\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u043e|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e|accessdate=2013-06-07|author=\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u0445\u0438\u043d (\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b \u042e. \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043a)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211212313/http://istoriya-kino.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000015/st003.shtml|archivedate=2012-12-11|language=Russian|url-status=dead}}</ref> Gostyukhin recalled that he transformed into Rybak to such a degree that even the made-up bruise only fell from his face after three weeks. After the film was shot the actor tried for such a long time to leave his role behind and to become himself again that he refused to star in Shepitko's next planned film, entitled ''Farewell'', despite her persistent requests.<ref name=teatral />\n\nThe production designer Yuriy Raksha later spoke about the situation as follows:\n{{Quote|text=\nWe started to work and began our unique existence along with the characters. I can say that the film matured us too. Speaking about the holy things, about categories of high spirituality, we were obligated to apply high standards to ourselves too. It was impossible to be one person on the set and to be another one in real life.\n}}\n\n===Release===\nThe film was nearly banned: regulatory authorities believed that a \"religious parable with a mystical tinge\" was shot instead of a partisan story. The chances were very high that the film would be shelved, until Elem Klimov (the husband of Larisa Shepitko and also a film director by profession) decided to take a desperate step. While Klimov was preparing for the shooting of the film ''Kill Hitler'' (which was released under the title of ''[[Come and See]]'' in 1985), he met with [[Pyotr Masherov]], the first secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus, who strongly supported the director and even acted as a historical consultant. During the war, the senior official was himself a partisan and moreover in 1942 the German occupiers hanged his mother for collaborating with the partisans.<ref name=horoshee /><ref name=trud>{{cite web|author=\u0418\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0418.|script-title=ru:\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435|url=http://www.trud.ru/article/04-01-2003/51289_vosxozhdenie.html|publisher=\u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434|location= \u041c.|year= 2003|issue=1 to 4 January|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nWhen Klimov, bypassing [[Mosfilm]], invited Masherov to a special preview of  ''The Ascent'', he initially was skeptical and was expecting to see \"effeminate directorial work.\" The still somewhat wet film was brought to [[Minsk]] directly from the lab, and Larisa Shepitko herself sat at the mixing console {{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=12}}. Twenty or thirty minutes after Masherov had started watching, he found he could not tear himself away from the screen, and by the middle of the movie he was crying, without hiding away from the republic's leaders who were present in the hall. At the end of the film, Masherov - contrary to tradition (usually at such premieres opinions were heard first from the lower ranks and then from the highest) - came on stage and spoke for about forty minutes. His words were not recorded by anyone but Elem Klimov testified that his excited speech was one of the best he ever heard addressed to his wife. The Belarusian writer and veteran of the Great Patriotic War, Ales Adamovich, who was present at the screening, described Masherov as someone who questioned, \"Where did this girl come from, who of course experienced nothing of the sort, but knows all about it, how could she express it like this?\"{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|1987|\u0441=15}} After a few days ''The Ascent'' was formally accepted without any amendments.<ref name=horoshee /><ref name=trud />\n\nIn July 2018, it was selected for screening in the Venice Classics section at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/news/restored-films-venezia-classici |title=Biennale Cinema 2018, Venice Classics |work=labiennale.org |accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of submissions to the 50th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n*[[List of Soviet submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* {{cite book |last=Klimov |first=Elem |author-link=Elem Klimov |trans-title=Larisa: book about Larisa Shepitko |script-title=ru:\u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430: \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043e \u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0435 \u0428\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e |location=Moscow |publisher=Iskusstvo |year=1987 |pages=290 |ref=harv |language=ru}}\n* {{cite book |last=Klimov |first=Hermann |last2=Murzina |first2=Marina |last3=Plahov |first3=Andrei |last4=Fomina |first4=Raisa |trans-title=Elem Klimov.

It was recorded several times in 1927\u2014first by Charles Hart, with successful versions by [[Vaughn De Leath]], [[Henry Burr]], and the duet of Jerry Macy and John Ryan. In 1950 the [[Blue Barron]] Orchestra version reached the top twenty on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles chart]].\n\nIn April 1960, after [[Elvis Presley's Army career|Elvis Presley's two-year service]] in the [[United States Army]], he recorded the song at the suggestion of manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]]; \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was Parker's wife, Marie Mott's, favorite song. Its release was delayed by [[RCA Victor]] executives, who thought the song did not fit Presley's new (and publicized) style. When \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was released in November 1960 it was an immediate success in the U.S., topping ''Billboard's'' Pop Singles chart and reaching number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]]. A month after the song's release, it topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Presley's version was certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for a Gold Record Award for 1,000,000 copies sold in the United States in 1983. It was upgraded by the RIAA to a 2xPlatinum Record Award for 2,000,000 sales in 1992.\n\n\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was later recorded by several other artists, with versions by [[Donny Osmond]] and [[Merle Haggard]] becoming top-twenty hits on the pop and country charts respectively. ''Billboard'' ranked \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" number 81 on its \"Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs\" list in 2008.\n\n== {{anchor|Writing and early recordings}}Composition and early versions ==\nThe song was written in 1926 by [[Vaudeville|vaudevillians]] [[Lou Handman]] and [[Roy Turk]] with three verses, followed by a spoken [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. They based the bridge on a line in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'',{{sfn|Schultz, William Todd|p=146|2005}} and \"You know someone said that the world's a stage.

This version with vocals by [[Howie Stange]] gained quite a following in New England, mainly due to Jim Flaherty's tireless promoting. At the November 1959 DJ Convention held in Nashville, Jim Flaherty handed [[Chet Atkins]] a copy of song with the encouragement of getting \"that kid down south ([[Elvis Presley]]) who is shaking things up\" to record it.<ref>Interview with Gus French, April 28, 2014</ref> In 1959, [[Jaye P.

The favorite song of Parker's wife, Marie Mott (who knew the song from [[Gene Austin]]'s act, since he was also managed at the time by her husband{{sfn|Creswell, Toby|p=31|2007}}), it was the only time he intervened in Presley's choice of repertoire. Presley returned to the studio with his band, consisting of [[Scotty Moore]], drummer [[D. J. Fontana]], pianist [[Floyd Cramer]], guitarist [[Hank Garland]], bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist [[Buddy Harman]], and [[the Jordanaires]], on April 3.{{sfn|Guralnick|1998|p=64}}\n\nAfter the eight songs Parker needed for ''[[Elvis Is Back!]]'' were recorded, Presley moved on to his manager's request. At 4&nbsp;am on April 4, the singer began recording \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", accompanied by acoustic guitar, drums, bass, and the backup group. He asked everyone else in the studio to leave the session, told [[Chet Atkins]] to turn the lights out, and performed the song with the spoken bridge. After the second [[take]], Presley said to producer [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]], \"Throw that tune out; I can't do it justice\". Sholes told engineer Bill Porter to ignore Presley's order and asked the singer to do a new take, explaining that the Jordanaires had bumped into their microphone stand while recording in the dark. Presley performed the song once more, and that take became the [[Audio mastering|master]] for the single.{{sfn|Guralnick|1998|p=65-66}}\n\n=== Release and reception ===\n\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was not released for several months while RCA executives decided if the ballad reflected Presley's new style, but they and Parker ultimately decided to release the song. It was released as a single on November 1, 1960, with \"I Gotta Know\" on the B-side, and pressing was assigned to plants in [[New Jersey]], [[Indianapolis]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Copies (with a sleeve featuring a smiling Presley in a [[Chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]] shirt against a blue background) were sent to 5,000 disc jockeys. Orders for the single began at 900,000 copies the first week and climbed to 1,200,000 during the second.{{sfn|Murray, Don|1961|p=66}}\n\nThe song debuted on ''Billboard's'' Top 40 at number 35 on November 14, moved a week later to number two and topped the chart by November 28 (replacing [[Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs]]' \"Stay\").

Kinison attempted to release the song as a single, but was unable to obtain the rights, so he recorded a raunchy version of [[The Troggs]]'s classic \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" instead.\n\nIn 2019, a version was released by [[Terry Manning]] on his album \"Playin' In Elvis' House\" which was actually recorded in the first house Elvis bought in Memphis.\n\nThere is also an answer song. In 1960, [[Dodie Stevens]] (of \"[[Pink Shoelaces]]\" fame) answered Elvis and recorded, \"Yes, I'm Lonesome Tonight.\"\n\nThe song of Presley was used in the classic film [[A Brighter Summer Day]] by [[Edward Yang]], a highly rated 1991 film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html|title= \n[\u6700\u4f73\u83ef\u8a9e\u7247\u4e00\u767e\u90e8] The Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Chart performance ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Chart\n!Peak position\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1927\n|[[Vaughn De Leath]]\n|Top selling records\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|[[Henry Burr]]\n|Top selling records\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|1950\n|[[Blue Barron]] Orchestra\n|[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|19\n|-\n|1959\n|[[Jaye P.

In 1950 the [[Blue Barron]] Orchestra version reached the top twenty on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Singles chart]].\n\nIn April 1960, after [[Elvis Presley's Army career|Elvis Presley's two-year service]] in the [[United States Army]], he recorded the song at the suggestion of manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]]; \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was Parker's wife, Marie Mott's, favorite song. Its release was delayed by [[RCA Victor]] executives, who thought the song did not fit Presley's new (and publicized) style. When \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was released in November 1960 it was an immediate success in the U.S., topping ''Billboard's'' Pop Singles chart and reaching number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]]. A month after the song's release, it topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Presley's version was certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for a Gold Record Award for 1,000,000 copies sold in the United States in 1983. It was upgraded by the RIAA to a 2xPlatinum Record Award for 2,000,000 sales in 1992.\n\n\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was later recorded by several other artists, with versions by [[Donny Osmond]] and [[Merle Haggard]] becoming top-twenty hits on the pop and country charts respectively. ''Billboard'' ranked \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" number 81 on its \"Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs\" list in 2008.\n\n== {{anchor|Writing and early recordings}}Composition and early versions ==\nThe song was written in 1926 by [[Vaudeville|vaudevillians]] [[Lou Handman]] and [[Roy Turk]] with three verses, followed by a spoken [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].

He asked everyone else in the studio to leave the session, told [[Chet Atkins]] to turn the lights out, and performed the song with the spoken bridge. After the second [[take]], Presley said to producer [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]], \"Throw that tune out; I can't do it justice\". Sholes told engineer Bill Porter to ignore Presley's order and asked the singer to do a new take, explaining that the Jordanaires had bumped into their microphone stand while recording in the dark. Presley performed the song once more, and that take became the [[Audio mastering|master]] for the single.{{sfn|Guralnick|1998|p=65-66}}\n\n=== Release and reception ===\n\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" was not released for several months while RCA executives decided if the ballad reflected Presley's new style, but they and Parker ultimately decided to release the song. It was released as a single on November 1, 1960, with \"I Gotta Know\" on the B-side, and pressing was assigned to plants in [[New Jersey]], [[Indianapolis]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Copies (with a sleeve featuring a smiling Presley in a [[Chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]] shirt against a blue background) were sent to 5,000 disc jockeys. Orders for the single began at 900,000 copies the first week and climbed to 1,200,000 during the second.{{sfn|Murray, Don|1961|p=66}}\n\nThe song debuted on ''Billboard's'' Top 40 at number 35 on November 14, moved a week later to number two and topped the chart by November 28 (replacing [[Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs]]' \"Stay\"). Presley's 15th chart-topping single,{{sfn|Colman, Stuart|2011|p=10}} it held the top position until January 9, 1961.{{sfn|Collins, Ace|2005|p=166}} \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" peaked at number three on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]], remaining on it for ten weeks.{{sfn|Collins, Ace|2005|p=167}} The song topped the [[List of Cash Box Top 100 number-one singles of 1960|''Cash Box'' singles chart]]{{sfn|Hoffman, Frank|p=834|1983}} and reached number 45 on the ''Cash Box'' country singles chart.{{sfn|Albert, George|p=280|1984}} A month after its UK release it topped the [[UK Singles Chart]].{{sfn|Humphries, Patrick|p=87|2003}} Three months after its release, the single had sales of two million copies worldwide; that year, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certified it gold.{{sfn|Murray, Don|1961|p=66}}\n\nA November 7, 1960 ''Billboard'' review called Presley's rendition a \"warm and touching performance\".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1960|p=45}} In a later review, [[AllMusic]] praised Presley's vocal range, calling \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" a \"tender&nbsp;... sugary ballad&nbsp;... full of soul and intense and intimate power\" defining \"one of Presley's darkest moments\".{{sfn|Janovitz, Bill|2013}}\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThe success of \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" made the song one of Presley's live staples. He performed it live for the first time on March 25, 1961, at a Bloch Arena benefit in [[Honolulu]] for the [[USS Arizona Memorial]], one of Presley's four live performances between his return from the Army and his shift in career focus to acting.{{sfn|Schultz, William Todd|2005|p=147}}\n\nReturning to music in 1968, Presley included the song on his playlist for the [[NBC]] special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'' and performed it live the following year during his first [[Las Vegas]] engagement.{{sfn|Schultz, William Todd|2005|p=148}} A version of the song, recorded on August 26 1969 and documenting Presley altering the words of the narration (\"Do you gaze at your bald head and wish you had hair\") and laughing through the rest of the bridge, was released in 1980 as part of the ''Elvis Aron Presley'' box set.{{sfn|Schultz, William Todd|2005|p=149}} In 1982 this \"laughing version\" was a radio hit in the [[United Kingdom]] and reached number 25 on the British Singles Chart.{{sfn|Humphries, Patrick|p=87|2003}} Presley included the song in his 1972 documentary, ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'', and the 1977 [[CBS]] special ''[[Elvis in Concert]]''.{{sfn|Schultz, William Todd|2005|p=149}}\n\nOn March 27, 1992, the RIAA certified \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" double platinum.{{sfn|RIAA|2014}} In 2008 (the 50th anniversary of ''Billboard's'' Hot 100), the song was number 81 on the magazine's \"Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs\" list.{{sfn|Billboard staff|2008}}\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n====Weekly charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1960-61)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Austria \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|Belgium \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Canada ([[CHUM]] ''Hit Parade'')\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Germany \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|4|song=Are You Lonesome Tonight|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Norway \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qartistid=38#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 27 October 1960]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|South Africa \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Spain \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Sweden  \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart|UK]] <ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[R&B]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Country]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|22\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19601231.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, December 31, 1960]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1961)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>[http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1961.htm Musicoutfitters.com]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|96\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box'' <ref>[http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19611230.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, December 31, 1960]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|}\n====All-time charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

During the spoken word section, Kinison improvised some of his trademark humor, asking the woman in the song if she was \"a reptile with a nice hairdo\" and lambasting her for being unfaithful. Kinison attempted to release the song as a single, but was unable to obtain the rights, so he recorded a raunchy version of [[The Troggs]]'s classic \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" instead.\n\nIn 2019, a version was released by [[Terry Manning]] on his album \"Playin' In Elvis' House\" which was actually recorded in the first house Elvis bought in Memphis.\n\nThere is also an answer song.
