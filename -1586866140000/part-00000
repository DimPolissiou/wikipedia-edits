The film is produced by Maram Bhuvaneswar and Pandem Satyadeep Reddy under the banner ''Hare Rama Hare Krishna Entertainments.'' The film stars [[Krishnudu]], [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] and [[Randhir Gattla|Randhir]] in the lead roles. [[Tashu Kaushik]] played the main female lead in the film opposite [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]. The film also stars [[Satya Krishnan]], [[Rajiv Kanakala]], [[Tanikella Bharani]] and [[Posani Krishna Murali]] in pivotal roles. The film performed poorly at the box office and received mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with a bank ATM robbery scene in which Chandu ([[Krishnudu]]) and Michael ([[Randhir Gattla|Randhir]]) steal lakhs of rupees from a bank ATM and manage to escape. KKR (Harsha Vardhan) is the investigating crime branch police officer for the case. He finds the wallet of Chandu in the crime scene and the purse contains Kranthi's visiting card in it.\n\nKranthi ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]), Chandu and Michael are three friends with three different mind sets. Kranthi wants to become a journalist and do something great for the society. Chandu wants to see his mother (Indu Anand) happy by helping her recover from her sickness. Michael just wants to live a lavish life without working hard.\n\nAfter three years, one morning Kranthi is shown shooting Police Officer Murthy ([[Ravi Prakash (Telugu actor)|Ravi Prakash]]) in his car. Chandu is seen working in an office and taking care of his unwell mother. Michael is enjoying his life borrowing money from all his friends without any thought of repaying them. Ajay is working for a software company where his team leader Snigdha ([[Tashu Kaushik]]) falls for him and persuades him for marriage. Kranthi is also seen supporting a charity called Prithvi Charitable Trust and is in need of 6&nbsp;lakh rupees for newly joined orphan children study fees.\n\nDoctor Padma (Sana) reveals Chandu that his mother is attacked with CNP which is a dangerous disease and she should get operated as soon as possible. He needs up to 7&nbsp;lakhs for his mother's surgery. Michael disguises himself as Nitin Verma from IMBI Bank with a fake visiting card and goes to Mr. Reddy, the owner of a company where his friend Gaurav works. He manages to loot 1&nbsp;lakh rupees from Reddy saying that he will arrange a bank loan for his company. Michael escapes from his home when his friend Gaurav calls and tells him that Reddy found about his fraud through Frederick, a guy who worked for Michael. While escaping, Michael meets his friends Chandu and Kranthi. Michael lies to his friends that he returned from the U.S. and is now planning to go to Singapore. Chandu offers his friend Michael to stay in his home along with his mother until he leaves to Singapore instead of staying in a hotel. When Kranthi gets a call, he leaves giving his visiting card to his friend Chandu. Then, Kranthi is shown stabbing Rao ([[Posani Krishna Murali]]).\n\nThe manager of Chandu ([[Jeeva (Telugu actor)|Jeeva]]) gives him promotion but doesn't give him salary increment. Depressed Chandu asks him to arrange some amount for his mother's surgery. While Chandu is worried about his mother's health, Michael enjoys with Chandu's money in his house and abuses Chandu's mother for coughing and disturbing him. He gives sleeping pills to Chandu's mother and also steals 50,000 rupees from Chandu's office money for his Singapore flight ticket. Chandu is liable for that money and is asked to repay immediately by his boss. Upon telling this to Michael, wicked Michael advises Chandu to go to his boss and admit the mistake seeking his help. Panicked Chandu goes to the hotel where his boss is staying and there he gets hurt with a bullet fired by Kranthi aiming to kill Prachanda ([[Subbaraju]]). Chandu is rescued by Kranthi and then upon being questioned by Chandu, Kranthi reveals his flashback behind his secret killings.\n\nPrithvi ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]) is the guru of Kranthi when he started his career as a budding journalist. Prithvi besides being a daring and talented journalist, he runs his own charity to support orphan children needs and education. He interviews health minister ([[Tanikella Bharani]]) about his pharmaceutical drug scam involving Rao and Prachanda, a business tycoon. All that is telecasted live by Tanmayi ([[Satya Krishnan]]), Prithvi's wife. Upon Kranthi's hint, Prithvi, Kranthi and Tanmayi investigate the drug scam details and plan to telecast it the next day. While they were discussing about this operation, Prithvi reveals their plan to Murthy, his friend. Murthy betrays Prithvi and reveals all these details to Prachanda. That night, Prachanda comes to the house of Prithvi along with Health Minister and Rao. He threatens Prithvi, molests Tanmayi and kills both of them. Angered Kranthi is doing all these secret murders to take revenge upon Prachanda, Murthy, Rao and Health Minister who are responsible for Prithvi and Tanmayi's death.\n\nWhile Chandu thinks of asking money for his mother's surgery from Kranthi, Kranthi calls Chandu for help in arranging 6&nbsp;lakhs to his trust by mortgaging his land documents. Desperate Chandu decides to rob a bank along with Michael. While Kranthi realises his love for Snigdha, she quits her job and decides to marry another man as she thinks Kranthi doesn't love her. One night, Chandu comes to Kranthi and reveals that he and Michael planned for the bank robbery and after robbery, Michael ditched him and escaped with the money. While Kranthi is worried about Chandu and himself, KKR comes to Kranthi's home for investigation. The climax is all about how Kranthi solved Chandu's problem.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Krishnudu]] as Chandu\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Kranthi Kumar\n* [[Randhir Gattla|Randhir]] as Michael\n* [[Tashu Kaushik]] as Snigdha\n* [[Rajiv Kanakala]] as Prithvi\n* [[Satya Krishnan]] as Tanmayi\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as A.P.

Prithvi besides being a daring and talented journalist, he runs his own charity to support orphan children needs and education. He interviews health minister ([[Tanikella Bharani]]) about his pharmaceutical drug scam involving Rao and Prachanda, a business tycoon. All that is telecasted live by Tanmayi ([[Satya Krishnan]]), Prithvi's wife. Upon Kranthi's hint, Prithvi, Kranthi and Tanmayi investigate the drug scam details and plan to telecast it the next day. While they were discussing about this operation, Prithvi reveals their plan to Murthy, his friend. Murthy betrays Prithvi and reveals all these details to Prachanda. That night, Prachanda comes to the house of Prithvi along with Health Minister and Rao. He threatens Prithvi, molests Tanmayi and kills both of them. Angered Kranthi is doing all these secret murders to take revenge upon Prachanda, Murthy, Rao and Health Minister who are responsible for Prithvi and Tanmayi's death.\n\nWhile Chandu thinks of asking money for his mother's surgery from Kranthi, Kranthi calls Chandu for help in arranging 6&nbsp;lakhs to his trust by mortgaging his land documents. Desperate Chandu decides to rob a bank along with Michael. While Kranthi realises his love for Snigdha, she quits her job and decides to marry another man as she thinks Kranthi doesn't love her. One night, Chandu comes to Kranthi and reveals that he and Michael planned for the bank robbery and after robbery, Michael ditched him and escaped with the money. While Kranthi is worried about Chandu and himself, KKR comes to Kranthi's home for investigation. The climax is all about how Kranthi solved Chandu's problem.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Krishnudu]] as Chandu\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Kranthi Kumar\n* [[Randhir Gattla|Randhir]] as Michael\n* [[Tashu Kaushik]] as Snigdha\n* [[Rajiv Kanakala]] as Prithvi\n* [[Satya Krishnan]] as Tanmayi\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as A.P.

Delta was immediately tasked to rescue the hostages and began training on storming the embassy with a compound mock-up built by military combat engineers at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, while putting together a complex multi-stage rescue operation involving a rigid schedule and demanding helicopter night-flying skills using first-generation night vision goggles. The rescue force was to be inserted by air force special operations [[C-130]]s at night to a remote location in the desert outside Tehran called [[Desert One]], and meet with a group of marine RH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, flown in from the [[U.S.S. Nimitz]] aircraft carrier staged nearby in the Indian Ocean. The helicopters would then be refueled on the ground at Desert One by refueling specialists using specially-designed fuel bladders inside the C-130s. The refueled helicopters and the rescue force (composed of Delta and Rangers) would then fly to a hidden staging location outside Tehran and hide until the next evening. On the evening of the rescue, Delta would drive to the embassy compound using pre-staged trucks, assault the compound and rescue the hostages, and take them across the street to a soccer stadium where the helicopters would have landed to extract them and take them to a nearby airfield which the Rangers would have assaulted and captured. [[C-141]]s would then extract the entire rescue force with hostages and the helicopters would be destroyed and left behind.\n\nThe helicopters caused the cancellation of the mission at Desert One, when enough helicopters were lost from attrition due to sandstorms, pilot fatigue, and failed hydraulics that the on-site commanders acknowledged helicopter numbers were below the required minimum for that stage to go forward and recommended to President Carter that he cancel the mission, which he did. As the entire rescue force was leaving Desert One, one of the helicopters crashed into a U.S. Air Force special operations C-130 and in the ensuing explosion and panic the helicopters were abandoned en masse leaving unauthorized mission plans which fell into Iranian hands, ruining any chance of a possible second covert rescue attempt following a brief regrouping period.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book | last = Haney | first = Eric L. | authorlink = Eric Haney | title = Inside Delta Force | publisher=Delacorte Press | year = 2002 | location = New York | page = 325 | isbn = 978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref>\n\n== Central American operations ==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2014}}\nDelta has seen action extensively in Central America, fighting the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] revolutionary group [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] and assisting the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-funded [[Contras]] in Nicaragua.<ref name=\"Haney\"/>\n\n== Operation Urgent Fury ==\nA second Delta mission launched in the early daylight hours of the first day of [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in Grenada was to assault Richmond Hill Prison and rescue the political prisoners being held there. Built on the remains of an old eighteenth-century fort, the prison cannot be approached by foot from three sides except through dense jungle growing on the steep mountainside; the fourth side is approachable by a narrow neck of road with high trees running along it. The prison offers no place for a helicopter assault force to land. Richmond Hill forms one side of a steep valley. Across and above the valley, on a higher peak, is another old fort, Fort Frederic, which housed a Grenadian garrison. From Fort Frederic, the garrison easily commanded the slopes and floor of the ravine below with small arms and machine gun fire. It was into this valley and under the guns of the Grenadian garrison that the 7 Blackhawk helicopters of Delta Force, B Squadron flew at 6:30 that morning.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe helicopters of Task Force 160 flew into the valley and turned their noses toward the prison. Unable to land, the Delta raiders began to rappel down ropes dragging from the doors of the helicopters. Suddenly, as men swung wildly from the rappelling ropes, the helicopters were caught in a cross-fire from the front, as forces from the prison opened fire; and more devastatingly, from behind, as enemy forces in Fort Frederic rained heavy small arms and machine gun fire down from above. According to eyewitness accounts by Grenadian civilians, a number of helicopters that could, flew out of the valley. In at least one instance, a helicopter pilot turned back without orders and refused to fly into the assault. Charges of cowardice were filed against the Nightstalker pilot by members of Delta who wanted to be inserted, but were later dropped.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n== Aeropostal Flight 252 ==\nOn 29 July 1984, Venezuelan [[Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela|Aeropostal]] Flight 252 departed from [[Caracas]] in Venezuela and was commandeered in flight by two hijackers who forced it to land on the island of [[Cura\u00e7ao]] part of the [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands]].

Army relations officers tried to play down Schwarzkopf's growing number of bodyguards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Delta was tasked with hunting for [[Scud|SCUD missiles]] alongside the British [[Special Air Service]] and other coalition special forces. On the last day of the ground war, Delta sniper teams located 26 SCUD missiles in western Iraq, each aimed at Israel. Armed with high-powered .50-caliber sniper rifles from as far as 3,000 yards, Delta squadrons punctured the missiles' fuel tanks and killed their crews. Had the SCUDs been launched, Saddam Hussein's last-gasp attempt at luring Israel into the conflict might have been successful. With Israel in the fight, the delicate Arab coalition opposing Hussein could have been unraveled. General Schwarzkopf who was the commander of the coalition against Saddam Hussein thanked the Delta Force with a letter sent to them which had this sentence. \"You guys kept Israel out of the war!\" exclaimed a grateful general Schwarzkopf.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Operation Gothic Serpent ==\n{{Main|Operation Gothic Serpent}}\nOn 3 October 1993, members of Delta Force were sent in with [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|U.S. Army Rangers]] in the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|conflict]] in [[Mogadishu]], Somalia code-named [[Operation Gothic Serpent]].\n\nThey were tasked with securing several of [[Mohammed Farah Aidid]]'s top lieutenants, as well as a few other targets of high value. The mission was compromised after two [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60L Blackhawk]] helicopters were shot down by RPGs. This resulted in an ongoing battle and led to the deaths of five Delta operators (a sixth was killed by mortar fire some days later), six Rangers, five army aviation crew, and two [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]] soldiers.

In the planning phase of the operation, the commander of Delta Force, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|LTC]] Pete Blaber, ruled out any helicopter infiltration of AFOs into the area so as not to alert the terrorists in the valley. In addition to AFOs conducting reconnaissance of routes into and around the valley on modified [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]] [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]], two teams climbed high into the mountains and gorges of the Shahikot to conduct environmental reconnaissance. Their vital intelligence was fed back to the AFO and would prove invaluable once the operation started. On February 28, on the eve of the operation, three AFO teams covertly infiltrated the valley. One code named Juliet, made up of five Delta operators with a signals intelligence specialist from the ISA, entered the valley on ATVs from the north, driving through the night in adverse weather conditions, eventually reaching a covert hide on the eastern side of the valley. Another team code named India, made up of three Delta operators and an attached ISA operator, walked into the valley through the same conditions to a hide in the southwest of the valley, known as the \"fish hook\". On March 2, the AFOs fought all day with the conventional troops of Task Force Rakkasan and the Green Berets of Task Force Hammer, calling in continuous airstrikes on al-Qaeda positions.

B Squadron (known as \"Wolverines\"), accompanied by several Air Force Special Tactics teams, a Delta intelligence and targeting cell, several military working dog teams and two American-Iraqi interpreters, was the first US SOF unit to enter western Iraq. The force crossed the border from [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|Ar'ar]] in 15 customised Pinzgauer 6x6 Special Operations Vehicles and several armed Toyota Hilux pick up trucks. As part of Task Force 20, their formal role was to conduct selected high-priority [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] on suspected chemical weapon facilities before heading for the [[Haditha Dam]] complex.

Several platoons from the 101st Airborne set up an outer cordon around the target house, a Delta assault team prepared to breach and clear the building from the entrance, while a Delta interpreter called upon the occupants to surrender. The informer and his two sons left the building as previously agreed. Delta operators breached and entered, upon which they were immediately engaged by a fusillade of small arms fire, which wounded one Delta operator. As they withdrew from the house, the occupants threw grenades from the second floor on the assaulters, and several Delta operators were lightly wounded by the grenade fragments; the stairs had also been blocked to impede any rapid assault. Another group of assaulters fast-roped from a MH-6 Little Bird onto the roof of the building to examine the possibility of entering the building through the roof, but this wasn't possible. The decision was taken to soften up the target with heavy weapons before another entry. After soldiers of the 101st Airborne engaged the building with .50&nbsp;cal HMGs and M136 anti-tank rockets, a third entry attempt was made, but was again driven back by intense gunfire. The 101st fired 10 TOW missiles from HMMWV-mounted [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW II antitank guided missiles]] into the house, followed by repeated gun runs from [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowas]] firing 2.75 rockets and .50&nbsp;cal machine guns.

The operation took place all across Iraq, In May 2005, Delta Force Operators deployed into [[Joint Special Operations Command Task Force in the Iraq War#Post-invasion Organization|Task Force Blue]]'s zone in the Euphrates valley and soon became engaged in a series of close-range battles with Sunni militants. The insurgents were large in number and fought with sophistication and intensity. On May 31, [[Sergeant first class|SFC]] Steven Langmack was killed during a mission near the Syrian border, becoming the first Delta fatality since 2003. On June 17, Delta force operators, with support of US Marine battalions, stormed a house in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|Al-Qaim]], near where SFC Langmack was killed. This assault targeted a number of \"bottom of the chain\" Al-Qaeda insurgents. The insurgents had a bunker inside the building, setting a trap for the assaulters. As a result, Delta MSGs' Michael McNulty and Robert Horrigan were killed. The Delta team withdrew from the house and a JDAM was dropped on the house.

These missions were known by the acronym CII (Counter Iranian Influence). Delta Force became part of Task Force 16, whose main aim was originally to carry out CII missions, but was later refocused to al-Qaeda; the CII missions were subsequently given to Task Force 17. Since at least 2004, there had been growing human intelligence about the training of Iraqi insurgents in Iran as well as financial backing and even the supplying of weaponry to Shia insurgents, as well as members of the [[IRGC|Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]] and other Iranian special forces.

The Delta Force operators are part of an Expeditionary Targeting Force numbering around 200 personnel, their main objectives are to gather enough intelligence from raids on terrorist-occupied compounds and hideouts, then from intelligence gathered at those sites they will give the ETF more intelligence about ISIS networks and quickly attack additional and related targets, in whats known as \"targeted\" missions.

The base was destroyed and all ISIS fighters killed at the cost of one American wounded during the insertion. There were no hostages present. The above account and other details of the raid have emerged from witnesses who spoke with a member of a Syrian opposition activist group, who identified himself as Abu Ibrahim al Raqaoui. Raqaoui told the information to Reuters in an interview via Skype from inside Syria. His group also posted witness accounts of the raid on Facebook soon after it took place. The posts, which were viewed by Reuters, have since been taken down. James Foley would later be executed on video and the operation revealed by the Pentagon. SIDENOTE: Roughly a quasi-above average number of Delta operations followed the failed Foley attempt. With their brethren in DEVGRU/SEAL Team 6, and the shadowy ISA/NSA and likely from ground task units used before in previous operations, Delta commanders (entire Squadron-sized assault elements were even considered, it has been rumored) grabbed and consolidated the remaining Delta in the AOR and then hastily put some small Task Forces out on the ground in almost all the most difficult to traverse areas inside Syria. In order to try and catch a track from the SSE of other \"dry holes\" that may not have yielded much, the primary focus, had to take a back seat, gratefully, to the very least, more than a hundred ISIS fighters, as well as IRGC-influenced proxies in various ACMs (Anti-Coalition Militas) were taken off the battlefield permanently. From everything from targeted strikes by Delta to armed ISR and AC-130s, the CENTCOM SOF made short work of the visible ISIL positions (but only the ones they were cleared to hit, said anonymous insiders who believed and still do, that ISIS could have been nearly 70% wiped out in their part of that battlespace) and still are from their bases in nearby countries like Jordan who are not sending their Special Operations in to not be heavy handed.

Delta was immediately tasked to rescue the hostages and began training on storming the embassy with a compound mock-up built by military combat engineers at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, while putting together a complex multi-stage rescue operation involving a rigid schedule and demanding helicopter night-flying skills using first-generation night vision goggles. The rescue force was to be inserted by air force special operations [[C-130]]s at night to a remote location in the desert outside Tehran called [[Desert One]], and meet with a group of marine RH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, flown in from the [[U.S.S. Nimitz]] aircraft carrier staged nearby in the Indian Ocean. The helicopters would then be refueled on the ground at Desert One by refueling specialists using specially-designed fuel bladders inside the C-130s. The refueled helicopters and the rescue force (composed of Delta and Rangers) would then fly to a hidden staging location outside Tehran and hide until the next evening. On the evening of the rescue, Delta would drive to the embassy compound using pre-staged trucks, assault the compound and rescue the hostages, and take them across the street to a soccer stadium where the helicopters would have landed to extract them and take them to a nearby airfield which the Rangers would have assaulted and captured. [[C-141]]s would then extract the entire rescue force with hostages and the helicopters would be destroyed and left behind.\n\nThe helicopters caused the cancellation of the mission at Desert One, when enough helicopters were lost from attrition due to sandstorms, pilot fatigue, and failed hydraulics that the on-site commanders acknowledged helicopter numbers were below the required minimum for that stage to go forward and recommended to President Carter that he cancel the mission, which he did. As the entire rescue force was leaving Desert One, one of the helicopters crashed into a U.S. Air Force special operations C-130 and in the ensuing explosion and panic the helicopters were abandoned en masse leaving unauthorized mission plans which fell into Iranian hands, ruining any chance of a possible second covert rescue attempt following a brief regrouping period.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book\n  | last = Haney\n  | first = Eric L.\n  | authorlink = Eric Haney\n  | title = Inside Delta Force\n  | publisher=Delacorte Press\n  | year = 2002\n  | location = New York\n  | page = 325\n  | isbn = 978-0-385-33603-1}}\n</ref>\n\n== Central American operations ==\n{{expand section|date=June 2014}}\nDelta has seen action extensively in Central America, fighting the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] revolutionary group [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] and assisting the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-funded [[Contras]] in Nicaragua.<ref name=\"Haney\"/>\n\n== Operation Urgent Fury ==\nA second Delta mission launched in the early daylight hours of the first day of [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in Grenada was to assault Richmond Hill Prison and rescue the political prisoners being held there. Built on the remains of an old eighteenth-century fort, the prison cannot be approached by foot from three sides except through dense jungle growing on the steep mountainside; the fourth side is approachable by a narrow neck of road with high trees running along it. The prison offers no place for a helicopter assault force to land. Richmond Hill forms one side of a steep valley. Across and above the valley, on a higher peak, is another old fort, Fort Frederic, which housed a Grenadian garrison. From Fort Frederic, the garrison easily commanded the slopes and floor of the ravine below with small arms and machine gun fire. It was into this valley and under the guns of the Grenadian garrison that the 7 Blackhawk helicopters of Delta Force, B Squadron flew at 6:30 that morning.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe helicopters of Task Force 160 flew into the valley and turned their noses toward the prison. Unable to land, the Delta raiders began to rappel down ropes dragging from the doors of the helicopters. Suddenly, as men swung wildly from the rappelling ropes, the helicopters were caught in a cross-fire from the front, as forces from the prison opened fire; and more devastatingly, from behind, as enemy forces in Fort Frederic rained heavy small arms and machine gun fire down from above. According to eyewitness accounts by Grenadian civilians, a number of helicopters that could, flew out of the valley. In at least one instance, a helicopter pilot turned back without orders and refused to fly into the assault. Charges of cowardice were filed against the Nightstalker pilot by members of Delta who wanted to be inserted, but were later dropped.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n== Aeropostal Flight 252 ==\nOn 29 July 1984, Venezuelan [[Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela|Aeropostal]] Flight 252 departed from [[Caracas]] in Venezuela and was commandeered in flight by two hijackers who forced it to land on the island of [[Cura\u00e7ao]] part of the [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands]].

Had the SCUDs been launched, Saddam Hussein's last-gasp attempt at luring Israel into the conflict might have been successful.  With Israel in the fight, the delicate Arab coalition opposing Hussein could have been unraveled.

In addition to AFOs conducting reconnaissance of routes into and around the valley on modified [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]] [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]], two teams climbed high into the mountains and gorges of the Shahikot to conduct environmental reconnaissance.

In late April 2004, just prior to the total withdrawal from the city, a small Delta Force element was co-located with a Marine platoon manning a pair of houses they were using as an observation post. The Delta operators were there to instruct the Marines on the use of the a new antistructural version of the [[AT4|AT-4 (M136) rocket]] when they were attacked by a large number of insurgents arrived in the vicinity. Sniper fire lead to RPG fire as the insurgents probed the American positions, PKM fire joined the RPGs and the assaults on the two buildings began from an estimated 300 insurgents. As Marines were wounded, Delta medic [[Staff sergeant|SSG]] Dan Briggs exposed himself to withering small arms fire crossing the street between the two houses on 6 occasions to treat the wounded Marines. Of 37 men, 25 were wounded and 1 killed. MSG Don Hollenbaugh and [[Sergeant major|SGM]] Larry Boivi positioned themselves on the rooftop of a three-storey building with a pair of Marines, and held back the attacks until a grenade landed on the roof, seriously wounding the two Marines and Boivin, who already had fragmentation wounds. The wounded were evacuated off the rooftop, leaving just Hollenbaugh who ran from position to position, alternatively firing his M4 carbine and AT-4 rocket launcher and throwing grenades, effectively suppressing and destroying a PKM gunner. The wounded were successfully evacuated; Boivin was awarded the [[Silver Star]], while Hollenbaugh and Briggs were awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, pp. 174\u201375.</ref>\n\nBy early 2004, a Joint Operations Center was set up in [[Balad Air Base]] where JSOCs war in Iraq would be run by the commander of Delta Force; it was operational by July.<ref>Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, p. 53.</ref> Delta Force stayed in Iraq throughout the duration of the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nOn June 8, 2004, the JSOC Task Force in Iraq conducted its first hostage rescue in Iraq: 4 Italian security contractors had been seized in April and soon after one was murdered by his insurgent captors, a Polish contractor was snatched at the start of June; the insurgents passed on a statement that other hostages would be executed unless Italy withdrew its contribution from the Coalition. Intelligence gathered from raids and solid detective work resulted in a daylight raid by operators from Delta Forces' A squadron against an isolated compound near Ramadi, which was codenamed Objective Medford. Four MH-60K Blackhawks carried the assault elements while 2 MH_60K Blackhawks served as (1) spare and (1) \"PC Bird\".

The operation focused on eliminating the groups from top to bottom, with particular emphasis on targeting the \"middle men\". The operation took place all across Iraq, In May 2005, Delta Force Operators deployed into [[Joint Special Operations Command Task Force in the Iraq War#Post-invasion Organization|Task Force Blue]]'s zone in the Euphrates valley and soon became engaged in a series of close-range battles with Sunni militants. The insurgents were large in number and fought with sophistication and intensity. On May 31, [[Sergeant first class|SFC]] Steven Langmack was killed during a mission near the Syrian border, becoming the first Delta fatality since 2003. On June 17, Delta force operators, with support of US Marine battalions, stormed a house in [[Al-Qa'im (town)|Al-Qaim]], near where SFC Langmack was killed. This assault targeted a number of \"bottom of the chain\" Al-Qaeda insurgents. The insurgents had a bunker inside the building, setting a trap for the assaulters. As a result, Delta MSGs' Michael McNulty and Robert Horrigan were killed. The Delta team withdrew from the house and a JDAM was dropped on the house. Due to the mounting number of killed and wounded in the squadron (Delta squadrons only number around 30 to 40 operators), [[General (United States)|General]] [[Stanley McChrystal|Stanley A.

As the Operators disembarked from their helicopters, they come under fire from a nearby house. The situation rapidly escalated into a full blown battle, and as more al-Qaeda fighters joined the firefight, the operators came under intense fire from small arms and mortars. 3 al-Qaeda fighters, including one suicide bomber, attempted to mount an attack via a truck but were killed under a hail of fire. Door gunners from the helicopters that had inserted the operators engaged the insurgents whilst AH-6 little birds made strafing runs against the insurgents. One AH-6 was shot down, killing the 2 crewmen. Despite the ferocity of the battle, the operators reached their targets and captured 4 insurgents and gave medical treatment for 3 injured women; during a lull in the fighting, a CASEVAC helicopter was brought in to remove the locals but it came under fire, causing the Americans to call in airstrikes on several targets around the landing zone. In the course of the mission, 3 other helicopters were forced to land due to damage from ground fire.

Bush]] sanctioned a new directive to allow US forces in Iraq to capture Iranian nationals if they engaged in targeting coalition forces, and efforts to do so were undertaken. These missions were known by the acronym CII (Counter Iranian Influence). Delta Force became part of Task Force 16, whose main aim was originally to carry out CII missions, but was later refocused to al-Qaeda; the CII missions were subsequently given to Task Force 17. Since at least 2004, there had been growing human intelligence about the training of Iraqi insurgents in Iran as well as financial backing and even the supplying of weaponry to Shia insurgents, as well as members of the [[IRGC|Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]] and other Iranian special forces. On January 11, 2007, following human intelligence received by the CIA at its Kurdish station, Delta Force operatives [[U.S. raid on the Iranian Liaison Office in Arbil|raided the Iranian Liaison Office]] (effectively Iran's embassy in the region) in [[Irbil]].

With their brethren in DEVGRU/SEAL Team 6, and the shadowy ISA/NSA and likely from ground task units used before in previous operations, Delta commanders (entire Squadron-sized assault elements were even considered, it has been rumored) grabbed and consolidated the remaining Delta in the AOR and then hastily put some small Task Forces out on the ground in almost all the most difficult to traverse areas inside Syria. In order to try and catch a track from the SSE of other \"dry holes\" that may not have yielded much, the primary focus, had to take a back seat, gratefully, to the very least, more than a hundred ISIS fighters, as well as IRGC-influenced proxies in various ACMs (Anti-Coalition Militas) were taken off the battlefield permanently. From everything from targeted strikes by Delta to armed ISR and AC-130s, the CENTCOM SOF made short work of the visible ISIL positions (but only the ones they were cleared to hit, said anonymous insiders who believed and still do, that ISIS could have been nearly 70% wiped out in their part of that battlespace) and still are from their bases in nearby countries like Jordan who are not sending their Special Operations in to not be heavy handed.

During a television taping in October 1978, Maivia [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned on]] and attacked him and Skaaland. In the immediate aftermath, fans for the first time got to see another side of Backlund's personality: that of a raving, ranting maniac when angered or pushed hard enough; in the post-match interview, Backlund screamed to interviewer [[Vince McMahon]] that he was going to \"kill that son of a bitch!\" Backlund eventually won a series of matches against Maivia, including a steel cage match in January 1979 at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn 1979, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) became the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). On November 30, 1979, [[NWF Heavyweight Championship|NWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Antonio Inoki]] defeated Backlund in Tokushima, Japan to win the WWF title. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president [[Hisashi Shinma]] declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], and Inoki remained Champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated [[Bobby Duncum, Sr.|Bobby Duncum]] in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 17. As Inoki refused the title, his reign is not included nor is it recognized by WWE in its official history.\n\nOn August 9, 1980, Backlund teamed with [[Pedro Morales]] to capture the WWF Tag Team Championship from [[The Wild Samoans]] at [[Showdown at Shea (1980)|Showdown at Shea]]. Backlund and Morales were forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the title due to a then-extant WWF rule stating that no one can hold two [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]] at the same time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/201 201]|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/201}}</ref> Backlund had more tag team success when he (along with Antonio Inoki) won the \"1980 MSG Tag Team League Tournament\", last defeating [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Stan Hansen]] on December 10 in Osaka, Japan. Backlund and Inoki finished the tournament with seven wins and two double-countout decisions.\n\nAlso during 1980, Backlund and Hogan met in a series of highly publicized matches; although he scored several countout victories over Hogan, Backlund never was able to score a decisive victory over his charismatic young challenger, and Hogan \u2013 showing flashes of his future superstardom \u2013 proved to be one of Backlund's toughest opponents. Backlund was also able to overcome a challenge from Ken Patera, with whom he feuded on-and-off from 1978 until early 1981, including during Patera's reign as [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n==== Early 1980s: continued success ====\nBacklund's WWF Heavyweight Championship was held up after a match in [[New York City]] against [[Greg Valentine|Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine]] on October 19, 1981, after a dazed referee \"accidentally\" gave the championship belt to Valentine as part of the storyline,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|date=October 19, 1981|quote=WWF World Champion Bob Backlund pinned Greg Valentine at 19:32; the title was held up after the battle when the dazed referee accidentally gave the title to Valentine; the title controversy was only a factor in NYC as Backlund continued to defend the title until the following month's rematch}}</ref> it constituted an interruption of Backlund's title reign.

Even with the title being held up against Antonio Inoki and Greg Valentine, Bob Backlund is recognized by WWE as having one continuous title reign from 1978 to 1983 as WWE Champion.\n\nBacklund continued to be successful into 1982 and 1983, successfully defending against a variety of contenders, ranging from [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.|\"Cowboy\" Bob Orton]], [[Big John Studd]], Ivan Koloff, [[Don Muraco|Magnificent Muraco]] and [[Sgt. Slaughter]]. One of his most memorable encounters came in mid-1982, when he won a steel cage match against [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]]; in that match, at [[Madison Square Garden]], Snuka scaled the top of the cage, intending to perform his [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|\"Superfly\" splash]] onto a prone Backlund to incapacitate him, but Backlund moved after Snuka began to fly through the air and went on to escape the cage. He also turned back a challenge from Superstar Billy Graham, who returned to the WWF in late 1982 wanting to reclaim the championship.\n\n==== End of an era ====\nAfter having been popular with the fans from early on, in the final months of his title reign, Backlund changed his image, cutting his mop hair into a crew cut, wearing amateur wrestling singlets and losing muscle mass and definition. Fans seemingly grew weary of this \"[[Howdy Doody]]\" character (as [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]] had dubbed him). In 1983, he was voted the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'''s ''[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Most Overrated|Most Overrated Wrestler]]''. [[Vince McMahon]], who had bought the WWF from his father, wanted to put the title on the more charismatic and muscular Hulk Hogan. McMahon initially suggested Backlund to turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and lose to Hogan, but when Backlund refused, a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Transitional champion|transitional champion]] became necessary between Backlund and Hogan. Backlund sustained a ([[kayfabe]]) arm injury when [[The Iron Sheik]] assaulted him with his Persian clubs and on December 26, 1983, Backlund lost the title to Sheik when Backlund's manager, [[Arnold Skaaland]], threw in the towel while Backlund was locked in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nDue to Backlund's injury, Hogan took over Backlund's rematch and became the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion.<ref name=\"SLH\">{{cite book|author=Shaun Assael and Mike Mooneyham|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2004|edition=Reprint|pages=33\u201334|isbn=978-1-4000-5143-4}}</ref> The injury was a television story only; Backlund wrestled The Iron Sheik at least three times for the title at [[house show]]s (including once at the [[Boston Garden]], winning by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]]), and also wrestled The Magnificent Muraco for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, also at a non-televised house show.<ref>[http://thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm]</ref>\n\nBacklund continued to work for the WWF for a while after the title change, but did not receive another title shot for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after Hogan's victory.

He soon dropped out of the pro wrestling scene in 1985, but he made a surprise return in 1991 for [[Herb Abrams]]' short-lived [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF).

During his time away from the ring, he coached amateur wrestling at [[Bacon Academy]] and Rocky Hill High School in Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-02-05-9902050166-story.html|title=FORGET VENTURE: CONNECTICUT PRO WRESTLER HOPES TO TAKE DOWN CONGRESSMAN LARSON|first=DAVID DALEY; Courant Staff|last=Writer|website=courant.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Return to WWF (1992\u20131997, 2000) ===\nIn 1992, Backlund returned to the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1992|quote=Bob Backlund pinned Skinner (Backlund's return after 8 years)}}</ref> During his absence, the WWF had expanded into an international wrestling promotion, due in part to the colorful characters of the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection Era\", which Hulk Hogan helped to kickstart eight years prior. Backlund, whose persona remained the same as it was in his heyday, seemed to be out of step with the evolution of the WWF. Many fans did not remember him, as he had left just prior to Vince McMahon's national expansion. His initial return to the WWF was largely uneventful and he mainly wrestled mid-card matches. However, at the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], Backlund, the number two entrant lasted sixty-one minutes and ten seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble3.xls|title=WWF Royal Rumble Statistics|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> a duration record that stood until 2004, when [[Chris Benoit]] broke it. Backlund's first appearance at [[WrestleMania]] was the [[WrestleMania IX|IX edition]], where he was quickly pinned by [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#IX|title=WWE WrestleMania|website=www.prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> Backlund also received several shots at the Intercontinental Championship, then held by [[Shawn Michaels]].\n\nOn the July 30, 1994, episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', Backlund wrestled what was billed as an \"Old Generation vs. New Generation\" match with [[Bret Hart]], with Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship on the line. Over the preceding weeks, the WWF aired vignettes of Backlund training for this match. Hart won the match, capitalizing after Backlund mistakenly believed he had won and helped Hart to his feet. Backlund \"snapped\" after Hart repeatedly tried to offer a sportsmanlike handshake following the match. He slapped Hart in the face and locked him in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface chickenwing|crossface chickenwing]] submission hold, while screaming hysterically. After finally releasing the hold, Backlund stared at his hands in apparent shock. Backlund then started to regularly \"snap\" in similar fashion during his matches, viciously attacking his opponent with the crossface chickenwing and refusing to release it after the opponent submitted. He would then seemingly snap back to normal and appear horrified by what he had done.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/>\n\nOn an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', shortly after his match with Hart, Backlund claimed that he should still be considered the legitimate WWF World Heavyweight Champion, as he had not been pinned by The Iron Sheik, nor [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submitted]] to the camel clutch. Backlund continued wrestling under the new [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of an out of touch and highly volatile eccentric, out to teach \"The New Generation\" a lesson.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> He dressed in business suits (complete with a bow tie), had a hyperactive personality and used (and often misused, for comic effect) large words during his interviews. He demanded that he be addressed as Mr. Backlund, and he would only sign autographs for wrestling fans if they could recite the names of all of the [[President of the United States|United States Presidents]] in [[Chronology|chronological order]]. On several instances, he assaulted wrestlers and other WWF employees and placed them in the crossface chickenwing. These victims include [[Jim Ross]], [[Duke Droese|Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese]], ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'' writer Lou Gianfriddo, and his former manager Arnold Skaaland, who he blamed for costing him the WWF Heavyweight Championship in 1983.\n\nOn November 23, 1994, at the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Backlund faced Bret Hart in a special [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|submission match]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship where the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the opponent's valet, like Arnold Skaaland did for Backlund over a decade earlier, stop the match by throwing a towel into the ring. Backlund began displaying a white towel that he claimed was the same one that was thrown into the ring the night he lost to The Iron Sheik. To serve as his second for the match, Backlund paired up with [[Owen Hart]], the brother and chief rival of the reigning champion who had tried and failed multiple times that year to wrest the belt from Bret.\n\nLate in the match, as Backlund was locked in Hart's trademark Sharpshooter submission, Owen entered the ring and attacked Bret from behind to cause him to break the hold. Bret's cornerman for the match, [[Davey Boy Smith]], chased Owen around the ring only to collide head first with the ring stairs. When Bret turned around to argue with his brother, Backlund took advantage and locked the crossface chickenwing on the champion. Hart fought the hold for an unprecedented eight-and-a-half minutes, but refused to give up.\n\nSince Smith was unconscious on the floor, he was unable to save Hart. Owen took advantage by picking up the pink and black towel Smith carried and, feigning concern for the well being of his brother, approached his father [[Stu Hart|Stu]] and his mother Helen who were seated at ringside. As Backlund continued to cinch in the crossface chickenwing in the ring, Owen pleaded for his parents to stop the match. Stu refused, not trusting Owen's motives. Helen, however, did not want to see Bret risk further injury and she grabbed the towel and threw it into the ring. Backlund was awarded the championship and celebrated in the ring while Owen rejoiced in finally having cost his brother the championship. After the match, Backlund conducted a brief interview which he concluded by screaming how he felt \"like [[God]]\".<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/><ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nBacklund's second reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion was brief, as he lost the title three days later to [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] at a non-televised show in Madison Square Garden,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> the site of many of Backlund's victories in the 1970s and 1980s. Diesel kicked Backlund in the stomach, hit him with a ''[[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife Powerbomb]]'' and pinned him in eight seconds.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> For weeks afterwards, fans jeered Backlund with chants of \"Eight seconds! Eight seconds!\". In a 2005 interview for the ''[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]'', Kevin Nash (a.k.a. Diesel) recalled how Backlund [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sold]] his ''Jackknife Powerbomb'' by crawling up the aisleway, back to the dressing room area of the Garden. Nash said, \"He couldn't have put me over any stronger\". This match was the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship changed hands at a non-televised event, and aside from [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] cash-ins, this match remains the shortest WWF title match ever; in fact, it would be tied by [[Randy Orton]] cashing in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract on [[Daniel Bryan]] at the [[SummerSlam (2013)|2013 SummerSlam]].\n\nAfter the title loss, Backlund wrestled progressively less often, never again reaching main event status. One of his final WWF matches was an [[\"I Quit\" match]] against Bret Hart at [[WrestleMania XI]] on April 2, 1995 which Backlund lost, even though he never actually said \"I quit\", instead screaming unintelligibly into the microphone, which [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Roddy Piper]] seemed to interpret as \"I quit\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#XI|title=WWE WrestleMania|website=www.prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref>\n\nFollowing WrestleMania, the WWF ran an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] in which Backlund declared his candidacy for President of the United States. Several vignettes aired, featuring Backlund preaching [[socially conservative]] values, and one showed him campaigning at a beach. Backlund also confronted a [[Bill Clinton]] [[impersonator]] who was seated at ringside at the [[Survivor Series (1995)|1995 Survivor Series]]. This angle was quietly dropped before it reached a conclusion.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1996, Backlund went to mid to low card status. He lost to Bret Hart by disqualification on [[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]] on November 21. That would be his last TV appearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=1969|title=WWF Monday Night RAW #139 \u00ab Events Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net}}</ref> He continued to appear in [[house show]]s. He lost to [[Savio Vega]] in a dark match at [[In Your House 5]] and competed in the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] getting eliminated by [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]]. This would be his last Pay-Per-View appearance.

After that, he briefly managed [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental]] and [[WWE European Championship|European]] Champion [[Kurt Angle]], and he taught his crossface chickenwing submission hold to Angle. Later on, Angle fired Backlund and locked him in that move, after discovering Backlund had booked him in a two-fall [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] against [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]] (with both of his titles on the line) at [[WrestleMania 2000]], where he ultimately lost both titles.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> Backlund teamed with Angle on [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] as they lost to Jericho and [[Tazz]] by disqualification on March 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=959&page=4&year=2000&promotion=1|title=Matches \u00ab Bob Backlund \u00ab Wrestlers Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net}}</ref>\n\n=== Japan and Independent circuit (1994-2001) ===\nIn 1994, Backlund while under contract with WWF worked for [[Genichiro Tenryu]]'s [[WAR (wrestling promotion)|Wrestle Association R]] in Japan. He won the [[WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship]] with [[Scott Putski]] and former WWF wrestler [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]] defeating [[Fuyuki-Gun]] members [[Hiromichi Fuyuki]], [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]] and [[Jado]] on August 26.

Given the tie breaking vote, Backlund launched a long explanation before declaring his decision a draw, and the match was restarted by PCS director Kevin Nash. After Shelley won the match, Starr pie-faced Backlund because he believed Backlund had cost him the match, at which Backlund responded by putting Starr in the crossface chickenwing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=1129|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023902/http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=1129|archivedate=September 30, 2007|title=TNA Final Resolution 2007 Results|date=January 15, 2001|quote=After the long list, Backlund had decided that the contest would be ruled as a draw.}}</ref> At [[Against All Odds (2007)|Against All Odds]] after [[Low Ki|Senshi]] defeated [[Austin Aries|Austin Starr]], Backlund came out and put his own chickenwing on Starr before dragging him to the back.\n\nBacklund then began to make regular appearances on ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]''. During this time, he was described as crazy and weird by commentators [[Don West (sportscaster)|Don West]] and [[Mike Tenay]], somewhat similar to the \"Mr. Backlund\" gimmick of his second WWF tenure. At [[Destination X (2007)|Destination X]], Backlund was in the corner of [[Austin Aries|Austin Starr]] who lost to [[Low Ki|Senshi]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Move) match|Crossface Chickenwing match]].

Backlund emerged from backstage to answer this challenge and, as Backlund entertained the crowd, Slater kicked him in the stomach and mocked him; Backlund responded by putting Slater in the crossface chickenwing, which he refused to break for 20 seconds after Slater had [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tap out|tapped out]]. He later appeared on ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' with all of the other Legends who had faced Slater over prior weeks, helping Lita chase Slater back into the ring when he tried to run away from [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] and the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]].\n\nBacklund was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 6, 2013, by his friend [[Maria Menounos]], and was acknowledged onstage with the year's other inductees at [[WrestleMania 29]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_69830.shtml|title=PWTorch.com - CALDWELL'S WWE WRESTLEMANIA 29 PPV RESULTS: Complete \"virtual-time\" coverage of live PPV from MetLife Stadium - Rock-Cena II, Taker-Punk, Lesnar-Hunter, more|website=www.pwtorch.com}}</ref>\n\nBacklund made an appearance on the October 7, 2013, episode of ''Raw'', unsuccessfully attempting to canvass votes in order to become the special guest referee for the WWE Championship match at [[Hell in a Cell (2013)|Hell in a Cell]]; [[Shawn Michaels]] later won a public vote and was named as the special guest referee.

During his freshman year while at [[Waldorf College|Waldorf Junior College]] in [[Forest City, Iowa]], Backlund was an [[All-American]] in both [[college football|football]] and wrestling ({{convert|191|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, finishing third). During his sophomore campaign, Backlund focused on wrestling and once again earned All American Honors ({{convert|190|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} and national runner-up). Backlund was an [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]] at [[North Dakota State Bison wrestling|North Dakota State University]], winning the Division II NCAA Championship at 190 pounds in 1971.

Backlund's clean cut look and technical approach made him a natural [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], and he quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|got over]] with the fans.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> After leaving the AWA, Backlund traveled the United States, working for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in its various [[List of NWA territories|territories]]. In 1974, Backlund wrestled in [[Texas]], for [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] and [[Terry Funk]]'s [[Amarillo, Texas]]-based [[Western States Sports]] promotion. In March, he defeated Terry Funk for the [[NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship]] (the promotion's top title).

He teamed with [[Gerald Brisco|Jerry Brisco]] to win the [[NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship]] from [[Charles Kalani, Jr.|Toru Tanaka]] and [[Mr. Fuji]] in October 1975. They held the [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belts]] for two months before losing to [[Les Thornton]] and Tony Charles. In 1976, Backlund left Georgia for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF, NWA Florida). Here he teamed with [[Steve Keirn]] to defeat [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Bob Roop]] for the [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]]. Backlund and Keirn lost the title to [[Hollywood Blonds#Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown|The Hollywood Blonds]] ([[Buddy Roberts]] and Jerry Brown) in October 1976.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> While working for NWA Florida, Backlund also wrestled in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], for [[Sam Muchnick]]'s [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]].

Less than four months into his WWWF run, Backlund received his first shot at the [[WWE World Championship|WWWF Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Superstar Billy Graham]], but he lost by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]. Through 1977, Backlund received additional title shots at the champion, and his fortunes started to change; the two went to a double [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] in one match,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/77.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1977|quote=WWWF World Champion Superstar Billy Graham fought Bob Backlund to a double count-out}}</ref> then Backlund defeated Graham, but by countout (the title can only change hands via pinfall or submission).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/77.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1977|quote=Bob Backlund defeated WWWF World Champion Superstar Billy Graham via count-out}}</ref> On February 20, 1978, at [[Madison Square Garden]], Backlund finally scored a [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] victory over Graham and won the title,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> despite Graham's leg being on the rope during the pinfall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/78.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1978|quote=Bob Backlund pinned WWWF World Champion Superstar Billy Graham to win the title at 15:51 with the [[Professional wrestling throws#Atomic drop|atomic drop]], even though the champion's foot was on the bottom rope during the pinfall.}}</ref>\n\nBacklund's early challengers for the title included [[Spiros Arion]], Mr. Fuji, [[Ivan Koloff]], [[George Steele|George \"the Animal\" Steele]], and [[Ken Patera]], and had his first high-profile title match in Japan, defending against [[Antonio Inoki]]. He also won a series of rematches against Graham, including an April 1978 [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel Cages|steel cage match]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nThree days after winning the WWWF Heavyweight Championship, Backlund clashed with the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] Harley Race in a rare \"WWWF vs. NWA\" title match.

During a television taping in October 1978, Maivia [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned on]] and attacked him and Skaaland. In the immediate aftermath, fans for the first time got to see another side of Backlund's personality: that of a raving, ranting maniac when angered or pushed hard enough; in the post-match interview, Backlund screamed to interviewer [[Vince McMahon]] that he was going to \"kill that son of a bitch!\" Backlund eventually won a series of matches against Maivia, including a steel cage match in January 1979 at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn 1979, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) became the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). On November 30, 1979, [[NWF Heavyweight Championship|NWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Antonio Inoki]] defeated Backlund in Tokushima, Japan to win the WWF title. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president [[Hisashi Shinma]] declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], and Inoki remained Champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated [[Bobby Duncum, Sr.|Bobby Duncum]] in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 17. As Inoki refused the title, his reign is not included nor is it recognized by WWE in its official history.\n\nOn August 9, 1980, Backlund teamed with [[Pedro Morales]] to capture the WWF Tag Team Championship from [[The Wild Samoans]] at [[Showdown at Shea (1980)|Showdown at Shea]]. Backlund and Morales were forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the title due to a then-extant WWF rule stating that no one can hold two [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]] at the same time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/201 201]|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/201}}</ref> Backlund had more tag team success when he (along with Antonio Inoki) won the \"1980 MSG Tag Team League Tournament\", last defeating [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Stan Hansen]] on December 10 in Osaka, Japan. Backlund and Inoki finished the tournament with seven wins and two double-countout decisions.\n\nAlso during 1980, Backlund and Hogan met in a series of highly publicized matches; although he scored several countout victories over Hogan, Backlund never was able to score a decisive victory over his charismatic young challenger, and Hogan \u2013 showing flashes of his future superstardom \u2013 proved to be one of Backlund's toughest opponents. Backlund was also able to overcome a challenge from Ken Patera, with whom he feuded on-and-off from 1978 until early 1981, including during Patera's reign as [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n==== Early 1980s: continued success ====\nBacklund's WWF Heavyweight Championship was held up after a match in [[New York City]] against [[Greg Valentine|Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine]] on October 19, 1981, after a dazed referee \"accidentally\" gave the championship belt to Valentine as part of the storyline,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|date=October 19, 1981|quote=WWF World Champion Bob Backlund pinned Greg Valentine at 19:32; the title was held up after the battle when the dazed referee accidentally gave the title to Valentine; the title controversy was only a factor in NYC as Backlund continued to defend the title until the following month's rematch}}</ref> it constituted an interruption of Backlund's title reign. However, Backlund was billed as the WWF Heavyweight Champion in other cities in the days following the controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|date=October 20, 1981|quote=WWF World Champion Bob Backlund fought WWF IC Champion Don Muraco to a draw}}</ref> In the early part of the 1980s, when no promotion held nationally televised events, it was not uncommon practice to \"hold up\" the title in one area (to build interest in a rematch the \"former\" champion would win) while ignoring the situation in other parts of the territory. On November 23, Backlund pinned Valentine for the \"Vacant in New York Only\" WWF Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|quote=Bob Backlund (w/ Arnold Skaaland) pinned Greg Valentine to win the vacant WWF World Heavyweight title at 15:36 with a German suplex into a bridge after avoiding a punch; in a move that was only recognized in the NYC area, the championship was vacated the previous month when the referee accidentally handed Valentine the title following his loss to Backlund}}</ref> A rematch for the title, held inside a steel cage at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]] in January 1982, also saw Backlund emerge the winner, securing the victory when he hit a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] on Valentine into the mat. Even with the title being held up against Antonio Inoki and Greg Valentine, Bob Backlund is recognized by WWE as having one continuous title reign from 1978 to 1983 as WWE Champion.\n\nBacklund continued to be successful into 1982 and 1983, successfully defending against a variety of contenders, ranging from [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.|\"Cowboy\" Bob Orton]], [[Big John Studd]], Ivan Koloff, [[Don Muraco|Magnificent Muraco]] and [[Sgt. Slaughter]]. One of his most memorable encounters came in mid-1982, when he won a steel cage match against [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]]; in that match, at [[Madison Square Garden]], Snuka scaled the top of the cage, intending to perform his [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|\"Superfly\" splash]] onto a prone Backlund to incapacitate him, but Backlund moved after Snuka began to fly through the air and went on to escape the cage. He also turned back a challenge from Superstar Billy Graham, who returned to the WWF in late 1982 wanting to reclaim the championship.\n\n==== End of an era ====\nAfter having been popular with the fans from early on, in the final months of his title reign, Backlund changed his image, cutting his mop hair into a crew cut, wearing amateur wrestling singlets and losing muscle mass and definition. Fans seemingly grew weary of this \"[[Howdy Doody]]\" character (as [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]] had dubbed him). In 1983, he was voted the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'''s ''[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Most Overrated|Most Overrated Wrestler]]''. [[Vince McMahon]], who had bought the WWF from his father, wanted to put the title on the more charismatic and muscular Hulk Hogan. McMahon initially suggested Backlund to turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and lose to Hogan, but when Backlund refused, a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Transitional champion|transitional champion]] became necessary between Backlund and Hogan. Backlund sustained a ([[kayfabe]]) arm injury when [[The Iron Sheik]] assaulted him with his Persian clubs and on December 26, 1983, Backlund lost the title to Sheik when Backlund's manager, [[Arnold Skaaland]], threw in the towel while Backlund was locked in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nDue to Backlund's injury, Hogan took over Backlund's rematch and became the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion.<ref name=\"SLH\">{{cite book|author=Shaun Assael and Mike Mooneyham|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2004|edition=Reprint|pages=33\u201334|isbn=978-1-4000-5143-4}}</ref> The injury was a television story only; Backlund wrestled The Iron Sheik at least three times for the title at [[house show]]s (including once at the [[Boston Garden]], winning by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]]), and also wrestled The Magnificent Muraco for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, also at a non-televised house show.<ref>[http://thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm]</ref>\n\nBacklund continued to work for the WWF for a while after the title change, but did not receive another title shot for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after Hogan's victory. On August 4, 1984, Backlund defeated [[Salvatore Bellomo]] in his last WWF match for eight years.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event \u2013 WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/16 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/16}}</ref>\n\n=== After the WWF and semi-retirement (1984\u20131992) ===\nAfter leaving the WWF, Backlund had a run in the short-lived [[Pro Wrestling USA]], a joint promotion of the NWA and the AWA, meant to combat the national expansion of the WWF. In Pro Wrestling USA, Backlund unsuccessfully challenged [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Rick Martel]]. He soon dropped out of the pro wrestling scene in 1985, but he made a surprise return in 1991 for [[Herb Abrams]]' short-lived [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF). At [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)#Beach Brawl|Beach Brawl]] (the UWF's only [[pay-per-view]] event), he defeated Ivan Koloff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/uwf-abrams/|title=Universal Wrestling Federation - OWW|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> Backlund also wrestled for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)#Newborn UWF|Newborn UWF]] and [[UWF International]] in Japan, in a series of matches with [[Nobuhiko Takada]] in 1988 and 1989. During his time away from the ring, he coached amateur wrestling at [[Bacon Academy]] and Rocky Hill High School in Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-02-05-9902050166-story.html|title=FORGET VENTURE: CONNECTICUT PRO WRESTLER HOPES TO TAKE DOWN CONGRESSMAN LARSON|first=DAVID DALEY; Courant Staff|last=Writer|website=courant.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Return to WWF (1992\u20131997, 2000) ===\nIn 1992, Backlund returned to the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1992|quote=Bob Backlund pinned Skinner (Backlund's return after 8 years)}}</ref> During his absence, the WWF had expanded into an international wrestling promotion, due in part to the colorful characters of the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection Era\", which Hulk Hogan helped to kickstart eight years prior. Backlund, whose persona remained the same as it was in his heyday, seemed to be out of step with the evolution of the WWF. Many fans did not remember him, as he had left just prior to Vince McMahon's national expansion. His initial return to the WWF was largely uneventful and he mainly wrestled mid-card matches. However, at the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], Backlund, the number two entrant lasted sixty-one minutes and ten seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble3.xls|title=WWF Royal Rumble Statistics|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> a duration record that stood until 2004, when [[Chris Benoit]] broke it. Backlund's first appearance at [[WrestleMania]] was the [[WrestleMania IX|IX edition]], where he was quickly pinned by [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#IX|title=WWE WrestleMania|website=www.prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> Backlund also received several shots at the Intercontinental Championship, then held by [[Shawn Michaels]].\n\nOn the July 30, 1994, episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', Backlund wrestled what was billed as an \"Old Generation vs. New Generation\" match with [[Bret Hart]], with Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship on the line. Over the preceding weeks, the WWF aired vignettes of Backlund training for this match. Hart won the match, capitalizing after Backlund mistakenly believed he had won and helped Hart to his feet. Backlund \"snapped\" after Hart repeatedly tried to offer a sportsmanlike handshake following the match. He slapped Hart in the face and locked him in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface chickenwing|crossface chickenwing]] submission hold, while screaming hysterically. After finally releasing the hold, Backlund stared at his hands in apparent shock. Backlund then started to regularly \"snap\" in similar fashion during his matches, viciously attacking his opponent with the crossface chickenwing and refusing to release it after the opponent submitted. He would then seemingly snap back to normal and appear horrified by what he had done.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/>\n\nOn an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', shortly after his match with Hart, Backlund claimed that he should still be considered the legitimate WWF World Heavyweight Champion, as he had not been pinned by The Iron Sheik, nor [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submitted]] to the camel clutch. Backlund continued wrestling under the new [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of an out of touch and highly volatile eccentric, out to teach \"The New Generation\" a lesson.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> He dressed in business suits (complete with a bow tie), had a hyperactive personality and used (and often misused, for comic effect) large words during his interviews. He demanded that he be addressed as Mr. Backlund, and he would only sign autographs for wrestling fans if they could recite the names of all of the [[President of the United States|United States Presidents]] in [[Chronology|chronological order]]. On several instances, he assaulted wrestlers and other WWF employees and placed them in the crossface chickenwing. These victims include [[Jim Ross]], [[Duke Droese|Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese]], ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'' writer Lou Gianfriddo, and his former manager Arnold Skaaland, who he blamed for costing him the WWF Heavyweight Championship in 1983.\n\nOn November 23, 1994, at the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Backlund faced Bret Hart in a special [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|submission match]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship where the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the opponent's valet, like Arnold Skaaland did for Backlund over a decade earlier, stop the match by throwing a towel into the ring. Backlund began displaying a white towel that he claimed was the same one that was thrown into the ring the night he lost to The Iron Sheik. To serve as his second for the match, Backlund paired up with [[Owen Hart]], the brother and chief rival of the reigning champion who had tried and failed multiple times that year to wrest the belt from Bret.\n\nLate in the match, as Backlund was locked in Hart's trademark Sharpshooter submission, Owen entered the ring and attacked Bret from behind to cause him to break the hold. Bret's cornerman for the match, [[Davey Boy Smith]], chased Owen around the ring only to collide head first with the ring stairs. When Bret turned around to argue with his brother, Backlund took advantage and locked the crossface chickenwing on the champion. Hart fought the hold for an unprecedented eight-and-a-half minutes, but refused to give up.\n\nSince Smith was unconscious on the floor, he was unable to save Hart. Owen took advantage by picking up the pink and black towel Smith carried and, feigning concern for the well being of his brother, approached his father [[Stu Hart|Stu]] and his mother Helen who were seated at ringside. As Backlund continued to cinch in the crossface chickenwing in the ring, Owen pleaded for his parents to stop the match. Stu refused, not trusting Owen's motives. Helen, however, did not want to see Bret risk further injury and she grabbed the towel and threw it into the ring. Backlund was awarded the championship and celebrated in the ring while Owen rejoiced in finally having cost his brother the championship. After the match, Backlund conducted a brief interview which he concluded by screaming how he felt \"like [[God]]\".<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/><ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nBacklund's second reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion was brief, as he lost the title three days later to [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] at a non-televised show in Madison Square Garden,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> the site of many of Backlund's victories in the 1970s and 1980s. Diesel kicked Backlund in the stomach, hit him with a ''[[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife Powerbomb]]'' and pinned him in eight seconds.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> For weeks afterwards, fans jeered Backlund with chants of \"Eight seconds! Eight seconds!\". In a 2005 interview for the ''[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]'', Kevin Nash (a.k.a. Diesel) recalled how Backlund [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sold]] his ''Jackknife Powerbomb'' by crawling up the aisleway, back to the dressing room area of the Garden. Nash said, \"He couldn't have put me over any stronger\". This match was the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship changed hands at a non-televised event, and aside from [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] cash-ins, this match remains the shortest WWF title match ever; in fact, it would be tied by [[Randy Orton]] cashing in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract on [[Daniel Bryan]] at the [[SummerSlam (2013)|2013 SummerSlam]].\n\nAfter the title loss, Backlund wrestled progressively less often, never again reaching main event status. One of his final WWF matches was an [[\"I Quit\" match]] against Bret Hart at [[WrestleMania XI]] on April 2, 1995 which Backlund lost, even though he never actually said \"I quit\", instead screaming unintelligibly into the microphone, which [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Roddy Piper]] seemed to interpret as \"I quit\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#XI|title=WWE WrestleMania|website=www.prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref>\n\nFollowing WrestleMania, the WWF ran an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] in which Backlund declared his candidacy for President of the United States. Several vignettes aired, featuring Backlund preaching [[socially conservative]] values, and one showed him campaigning at a beach. Backlund also confronted a [[Bill Clinton]] [[impersonator]] who was seated at ringside at the [[Survivor Series (1995)|1995 Survivor Series]]. This angle was quietly dropped before it reached a conclusion.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1996, Backlund went to mid to low card status. He lost to Bret Hart by disqualification on [[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]] on November 21. That would be his last TV appearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=1969|title=WWF Monday Night RAW #139 \u00ab Events Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net}}</ref> He continued to appear in [[house show]]s.

After that, he briefly managed [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental]] and [[WWE European Championship|European]] Champion [[Kurt Angle]], and he taught his crossface chickenwing submission hold to Angle. Later on, Angle fired Backlund and locked him in that move, after discovering Backlund had booked him in a two-fall [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] against [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]] (with both of his titles on the line) at [[WrestleMania 2000]], where he ultimately lost both titles.<ref name=\"WWF80s\"/> Backlund teamed with Angle on [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] as they lost to Jericho and [[Tazz]] by disqualification on March 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=959&page=4&year=2000&promotion=1|title=Matches \u00ab Bob Backlund \u00ab Wrestlers Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net}}</ref>\n\n=== Japan and Independent circuit (1994-2001) ===\nIn 1994, Backlund while under contract with WWF worked for [[Genichiro Tenryu]]'s [[WAR (wrestling promotion)|Wrestle Association R]] in Japan. He won the [[WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship]] with [[Scott Putski]] and former WWF wrestler [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]] defeating [[Fuyuki-Gun]] members [[Hiromichi Fuyuki]], [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]] and [[Jado]] on August 26.

Given the tie breaking vote, Backlund launched a long explanation before declaring his decision a draw, and the match was restarted by PCS director Kevin Nash. After Shelley won the match, Starr pie-faced Backlund because he believed Backlund had cost him the match, at which Backlund responded by putting Starr in the crossface chickenwing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=1129|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023902/http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=1129|archivedate=September 30, 2007|title=TNA Final Resolution 2007 Results|date=January 15, 2001|quote=After the long list, Backlund had decided that the contest would be ruled as a draw.}}</ref> At [[Against All Odds (2007)|Against All Odds]] after [[Low Ki|Senshi]] defeated [[Austin Aries|Austin Starr]], Backlund came out and put his own chickenwing on Starr before dragging him to the back.\n\nBacklund then began to make regular appearances on ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]''. During this time, he was described as crazy and weird by commentators [[Don West (sportscaster)|Don West]] and [[Mike Tenay]], somewhat similar to the \"Mr. Backlund\" gimmick of his second WWF tenure. At [[Destination X (2007)|Destination X]], Backlund was in the corner of [[Austin Aries|Austin Starr]] who lost to [[Low Ki|Senshi]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Move) match|Crossface Chickenwing match]].

Backlund emerged from backstage to answer this challenge and, as Backlund entertained the crowd, Slater kicked him in the stomach and mocked him; Backlund responded by putting Slater in the crossface chickenwing, which he refused to break for 20 seconds after Slater had [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tap out|tapped out]]. He later appeared on ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' with all of the other Legends who had faced Slater over prior weeks, helping Lita chase Slater back into the ring when he tried to run away from [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] and the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]].\n\nBacklund was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 6, 2013, by his friend [[Maria Menounos]], and was acknowledged onstage with the year's other inductees at [[WrestleMania 29]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_69830.shtml|title=PWTorch.com - CALDWELL'S WWE WRESTLEMANIA 29 PPV RESULTS: Complete \"virtual-time\" coverage of live PPV from MetLife Stadium - Rock-Cena II, Taker-Punk, Lesnar-Hunter, more|website=www.pwtorch.com}}</ref>\n\nBacklund made an appearance on the October 7, 2013, episode of ''Raw'', unsuccessfully attempting to canvass votes in order to become the special guest referee for the WWE Championship match at [[Hell in a Cell (2013)|Hell in a Cell]]; [[Shawn Michaels]] later won a public vote and was named as the special guest referee.
