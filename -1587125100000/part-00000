He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508).

Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several armed robberies and car thefts, he and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.

The compartment coach was developed at the very beginning of the railway era in England simply by placing a [[post coach]] body on a railway undercarriage. Compartment coaches were used across almost the whole of [[Europe]] and were built right up to the 1930s. On the European continent they were sometimes referred to as ''English coaches'' or coaches built to the ''English system''.\n\n== American corridor coach ==\n{{main|Corridor coach}}\nThe compartment coach should not be confused with the classic [[express train]] coach of the first part of the twentieth century; the [[corridor coach]] which also has separate compartments and is still known as a compartment coach in other languages (e.g. German: ''Abteilwagen''). A corridor coach has covered [[Corridor connection|gangways]], side entrances and partitioned compartments with a corridor down one side. (This should not be confused with the first class sleeper accommodation, the ''[[Sleeping_car#Compartments and Double Bedrooms|compartment]].'')\n\n== Early compartment coaches ==\nThe first compartment coaches in the 19th century comprised several cabins on one undercarriage, similar to the post coaches. Compartment coaches with doors for each compartment, without any connexion between compartments, were built up to the end of the 20th century. The disadvantages of this design were that passengers could not use the toilet or visit the [[dining car]] and that train staff had to climb along the outside of the coach on running boards in order to check tickets. Countless four-, six- and eight-wheeled vehicles of this type were used in Germany and especially by the [[Prussian state railways]].\n\n=== Development in Prussia ===\nUntil about 1880, four-wheeled compartment coaches were typical. After the end of the wave of nationalisations the Prussian state railways, around 1895, acquired the quieter-running six-wheelers. For this, so-called norms were established for four-, six- and, later, eight-wheeled classes of coach. For the six-wheelers, both fixed axle and sliding axle designs were envisaged. Those coaches designed specifically for suburban traffic (Berlin, Hamburg) had no toilets. On the other coaches, a gangway was specified in order to keep the number of toilets to a minimum for economic reasons. Numerous coaches had therefore to be converted. After the end of the 19th century, fourth class compartment coaches were also procured.\n\nFour- and six-wheeled compartment coaches were initially used in all [[Train categories in Europe|train categories]] on main lines. With the advent of the ''D-Zug'' express coaches in 1892, compartment coaches were deployed in passenger trains on [[Main line (railway)|main lines]] and in built-up areas. Here it became abundantly clear that, in addition a faster turn round of passengers, access to station platforms on main lines could only be permitted if passengers had valid tickets and trains could not be boarded until shortly before their departure. So ticket checking by the guard became a function of station staff. By contrast, open coaches were common on branch lines, because there were often no platform barriers on branch line stations and so tickets had to be checked in the train itself.\n \nFrom 1895, especially in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] (but also to a lesser extent in [[Baden]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Alsace-Lorraine]]), eight-wheeled compartment coaches were built. They were predominantly used in the semi-fast trains or ''[[Eilz\u00fcge]]'' introduced in 1907 and in the so-called fast passenger trains. Over 3,500 coaches were built in several batches starting in 1898. The compartments in the coaches were sometimes linked to provide access to the toilets. In third class coaches the privies lacked flushing facilities until some time later.\n\nInitially the window frames on compartment coaches - like the coach bodies themselves - were made of wood, which very quickly warped. After 1900 they were made of a brass alloy based on a patent by the [[Julius Pintsch AG]] firm. The upper part of the window frame on these coaches was rounded.\n\nFrom 1910 the former paraffin lighting was replaced by more efficient gas lighting. After 1900, rising wood prices forced a switch to steel construction and then to lower value materials during the [[First World War]].\n\n[[Prussian state railways]] coaches were equipped with standard bogies with two and later three spring systems. Most coaches were 18.55 m long. Initially ''[[Railway air brake|Westinghouse brakes]]'' were used, but after 1900 they were fitted with standard [[Knorr brakes]]. The hand brake was housed in a separate [[brakeman's cabin]] at one end of the coach. These were removed in 1930.\n\nOf the 21,000 compartment coaches of all types that were built, 14,000 were handed to other countries after the [[First World War]] as [[World War I reparations|reparations]]. Of these, 5,000 went to the re-emergent [[Poland]].\n\n=== Overview of Prussian eight-wheeled coaches ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:50px;\" | Prussian class\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:100px;\" | DRG template\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:50px;\" | First built\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:50px;\" | No. of coaches\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:50px;\" | No. of seats\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:50px;\" | No. of toilets\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:50px;\" | Length over buffers\n! style=\"background:#B3B7FF; width:250px;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| ABB || B4 Pr 95||1895 || 350 || 10/31|| 3 || 18,15 m ||\n|-\n| ABCC || BC4 Pr 98||1898 || 200 || 5/21/32|| 4 || 18,20 m ||\n|-\n| CC || C4 Pr 94||1895 || 350 || 80|| 3 || 17,88 m ||\n|-\n| ABB || B4 Pr 02||1902 || 200 || 10/31|| 3 || ||\n|-\n| ABCC || BC4 Pr 98a||1898 || 200 || 50/31/32|| 4 || ||\n|-\n| CC || C4 Pr 02||1902|| 300 || 76|| 5 || ||\n|-\n| ABB || B4 Pr 04||1904 || 350 || 10/31 || |3 || ||\n|-\n| ABCC || BC Pr 04||1904 || 250 || 5/21/32 || 4 || ||\n|-\n| BCC || BC Pr 05||1905 || 100 || 20/48|| 5 || ||\n|-\n| CC || C4 Pr 04||1904 || 450 || 76|| 5 || ||\n|-\n| CC || C Pr 12/12a||1911 || 650 || 76|| 4 || 18,62 m ||\n|-\n| BB || B4 Pr 18||1918 || 40 || 47|| 3 || 19,20 m ||\n|-\n| CC|| C4 Pr 18||1918 || 86 || 76 || 4 || ||\n|-\n|}\n<small>Length over buffers (L\u00fcP) is 18.55 m, unless otherwise stated</small>\n\n=== Development by the Deutsche Reichsbahn ===\n\nIn order to rationalise wagon maintenance the centre axle was removed from 1920 on many of the six-wheeled compartment coaches, because it had been established that this had no negative impact on the riding qualities. In addition, in order to overcome the pressing shortage of coaches following the ceasefire reparations of 1918/19, another 500 four-wheeled compartment coaches of Prussian design were ordered (50 seconds and 450 Wagen third class coaches). In addition, due to the great shortage of wagons, many former Prussian coaches were reallocated to the south German [[Reichsbahndirektion|railway divisions]] so that they could now be seen across the entire [[German Empire]].\n\nIn the mid-1920s the [[brakeman's cabin]] was removed on those coaches that now ran on electrified routes. With the demise of the fourth passenger class in 1928, many compartment coaches were converted to coaches with heavy luggage sections (''Traglastenwagen'') by combining of compartments. After the DRG had introduced new four-door Typs E 30 ''[[Eilzugwagen]]'' (semi-fast coaches) in 1930, still more coaches had passenger compartments knocked into larger compartments which were classed as heavy luggage compartments (''Traglastenabteil'').\n\nSeveral of these compartment coaches were used for express services along the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] (''Ruhrschnellverkehr''). They were given the DRG's red and beige livery used for multiple-unit trains. The window sections of second class coaches were painted in Stadtbahn blue-green ([[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] 6004) as on the [[Berlin S-Bahn]]. Even 18 new compartment coaches were bought for this purpose.\n\n=== Post-war development ===\n\nMost of the compartment coaches were rebuilt by the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] (DB) in the 1950s into ''[[Umbauwagen]]'' (rebuild coaches). The compartment coaches that remained in the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR)|East German Reichsbahn]] (DR) had several compartments combined and, as on the six-wheeled coaches, every second door was removed. In the 1960s the compartment coaches were converted to the so-called ''[[Rekowagen]]'' (rebuilds).\n\nSince the [[Second World War]] compartment coaches have largely died out in Germany, as in other European countries, and have been largely replaced by [[corridor coach]]es and, increasingly nowadays, [[open coaches]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Passenger cars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Compartment Coach}}\n[[Category:Passenger coaches]]\n", "text_old": "{{globalize|date=June 2018}}\n{{short description|Railway carriage type}}\n[[Image:Preuss Abteilwagen C3 P9030010.JPG|thumb|280px|Prussian 3rd class compartment coach]]\nA '''compartment coach''' is a railway [[passenger coach]] (US: [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]) divided into separate areas or compartments, with no means of moving between compartments.<ref>{{Ellis' Railway Encyclopaedia|73}}</ref> A compartment train with a corridor is a [[corridor coach]]. \n\n== English origins ==\nOriginally compartment coaches were passenger coaches with several separate compartments in the same coach body, each compartment having its own doors on the side of the coach to enable passengers to board and alight.

In the 1960s the compartment coaches were converted to the so-called ''[[Rekowagen]]'' (rebuilds).\n\nSince the [[Second World War]] compartment coaches have largely died out in Germany, as in other European countries, and have been largely replaced by [[corridor coach]]es and, increasingly nowadays, [[open coaches]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Passenger cars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Compartment Coach}}\n[[Category:Passenger coaches]]\n", "name_user": "PeterFV", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDevelopment in Prussia", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_coach"}
