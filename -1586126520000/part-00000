It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in an attempt to develop foresight. Around the world the field is variously referred to as '''futures studies''', '''[[strategic foresight]]''', '''futuristics''', '''futures thinking''', '''futuring''', and '''futurology'''. Futures studies and strategic foresight are the academic field's most commonly used terms in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world.<ref name=\"Sardar, Z. 2010 pp. 177\"/>\n\n'''Foresight''' was the original term and was first used in this sense by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1932.<ref name=\"Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91\">Wells, H.G. (1932) 1987. Wanted: Professors of Foresight! ''Futures Research Quarterly'' V3N1 (Spring): p. 89-91.</ref> \"Futurology\" is a term common in encyclopedias, though it is used almost exclusively by nonpractitioners today, at least in the English-speaking world. \"Futurology\" is defined as the \"study of the future.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|title=SCIENCE GLOSSARY|work=tripod.com|access-date=2007-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506011318/http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|archive-date=2007-05-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The term was coined by [[German people|German]] professor [[Ossip K. Flechtheim]] in the mid-1940s, who proposed it as a new branch of knowledge that would include a new science of [[probability]]. This term has fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Peter |last2=Hines |first2=Andy |title=Teaching about the Future |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Houndsmill, UK |isbn=978-0230363496}}</ref>\n\nThree factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all of these disciplines overlap, to differing degrees). First, futures studies often examines trends to compose possible, probable, and preferable futures along with the role \"wild cards\" can play on future scenarios. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a [[Holism|holistic]] or [[systemics|systemic]] view based on insights from a range of different disciplines, generally focusing on the STEEP<ref>{{cite web|title=What is STEEP Analysis?|url=http://pestleanalysis.com/what-is-steep-analysis/|website=PESTLE Analysis|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2015-02-11}}</ref> categories of Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental and Political. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions. For example, many people expect the collapse of the Earth's ecosystem in the near future, while others believe the current ecosystem will survive indefinitely. A foresight approach would seek to analyze and highlight the assumptions underpinning such views.\n\nAs a field, futures studies expands on the research component, by emphasizing the communication of a strategy and the actionable steps needed to implement the plan or plans leading to the preferable future.  It is in this regard, that futures studies evolves from an academic exercise to a more traditional business-like practice, looking to better prepare organizations for the future.\n\nFutures studies does not generally focus on short term predictions such as [[interest rate]]s over the next [[business cycle]], or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops goals and objectives with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. Plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate possible future events are definitely part of the field.  As a rule, futures studies is generally concerned with changes of transformative impact, rather than those of an incremental or narrow scope.\n\nThe futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed [[supernatural]] means.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|215x215px|[[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], originator of the 'Utopian' ideal.]]\n[[Johan Galtung]] and [[Sohail Inayatullah]]<ref>Galtung, Johan and Inayatullah, Sohail (1997).

''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' written by [[Samuel Madden]] in 1733, takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998 from British representatives in the foreign cities of [[Constantinople]], [[Rome]], [[Paris]], and [[Moscow]].<ref>\"Samuel Madden's ''Memoirs of the Twentieth Century''\" Paul Alkon.

Madden went on to write ''The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925'', where (in the context of the [[History of the British canal system|boom in canal construction at the time]]) he envisioned a large network of waterways that would radically transform patterns of living - \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/nov/06/features11.g21|title=And now for the forecast|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2000-11-06|last1=Margolis|first1=Jonathan}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Scientific American]], the oldest continuously published magazine in the U.S., began publishing articles about scientific and technological research, with a focus upon the future implications of such research. It would be followed in 1872 by the magazine [[Popular Science]], which was aimed at a more general readership.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe genre of [[science fiction]] became established towards the end of the 19th century, with notable writers, including [[Jules Verne]] and [[H.

The lecture was well-received and was soon republished in book form. He advocated for the establishment of a new academic study of the future that would be grounded in scientific methodology rather than just speculation. He argued that a scientifically ordered vision of the future \"will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred years to make the geological past.\" Although conscious of the difficulty in arriving at entirely accurate predictions, he thought that it would still be possible to arrive at a \"working knowledge of things in the future\".<ref name=\"Wagar\"/>\n\nIn his fictional works, Wells predicted the invention and use of the [[atomic bomb]] in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914).<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard Rhodes | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | url = https://archive.org/details/makingofatomicbo00rhod | url-access = registration | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | page = [https://archive.org/details/makingofatomicbo00rhod/page/24 24] | isbn = 978-0-684-81378-3| author-link = Richard Rhodes }}</ref> In ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933) the impending [[World War II|World War]] and cities destroyed by aerial bombardment was depicted.<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. \"Outline of Wells's History.\" ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (p. 22\u201323).</ref> However, he didn't stop advocating for the establishment of a futures science.

The [[World War I|WWI]] era led to adoption of futures thinking in institutions throughout Europe. The [[Russian Revolution]] led to the 1921 establishment of the Soviet Union's [[Gosplan]], or State Planning Committee, which was active until the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]]. Gosplan was responsible for economic planning and created plans in five year increments to govern the economy. One of the first Soviet dissidents, [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], published the first [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', in 1921. The science fiction and political satire featured a future police state and was the first work censored by the Soviet censorship board, leading to Zamyatin's political exile.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the United States, President [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] created the Research Committee on Social Trends, which produced a report in 1933. The head of the committee, [[William Fielding Ogburn|William F. Ogburn]], analyzed the past to chart trends and project those trends into the future, with a focus on technology. Similar technique was used during [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]], with the addition of alternative futures and a set of likely outcomes that resulted in the creation of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the Tennessee Valley development project.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[World War II|WWII]] era emphasized the growing need for foresight. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] used strategic plans to unify and mobilize their society with a focus on creating a fascist utopia. This planning and the subsequent war forced global leaders to create their own strategic plans in response. The post-war era saw the creation of numerous nation states with complex political alliances and was further complicated by the introduction of nuclear power.\n\n[[RAND Corporation|Project RAND]] was created in 1946 as joint project between the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], and later incorporated as the non-profit [[RAND Corporation|RAND corporation]]. Their objective was the future of weapons, and long-range planning to meet future threats.

A View of the Future'' (1972).<ref name=\"Bell 1997\" />\n\nFuture studies had a parallel origin with the birth of [[systems science]] in [[academia]], and with the idea of national economic and political [[planning]], most notably in [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Bell 1997\"/><ref name=\"Masini 1993\">{{cite book| last=Masini| first= Eleonora| year=1993| title=Why Futures Studies?| publisher=Grey Seal Books| location=London, UK}}</ref> In the 1950s, the people of France were continuing to reconstruct their war-torn country. In the process, French scholars, philosophers, writers, and artists searched for what could constitute a more positive future for humanity. The [[Soviet Union]] similarly participated in postwar rebuilding, but did so in the context of an established [[Planned economy|national economic planning process]], which also required a long-term, systemic statement of social goals. Future studies was therefore primarily engaged in national planning, and the construction of national symbols.\n[[File:Rachel Carson w (cropped).jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Rachel Carson]], author of [[Silent Spring|''The Silent Spring'']], which helped launch the environmental movement and a new direction for futures research.]]\nBy contrast, in the [[United States]], futures studies as a discipline emerged from the successful application of the tools and perspectives of [[systems analysis]], especially with regard to quartermastering the war-effort.

Several of the most notable writers to emerge during this era include: sociologist [[Fred Polak|Fred L. Polak]], whose work ''Images of the Future'' (1961) discusses the importance of images to society's creation of the future; [[Marshall McLuhan]], whose ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) and ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) put forth his theories on how technologies change our cognitive understanding; and [[Rachel Carson]]\u2019s ''[[Silent Spring|The Silent Spring]]'' (1962) which was hugely influential not only to future studies but also the creation of the environmental movement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInventors such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] also began highlighting the effect technology might have on global trends as time progressed.\n\nBy the 1970s there was an obvious shift in the use and development of futures studies; its focus was no longer exclusive to governments and militaries. Instead, it embraced a wide array of technologies, social issues, and concerns. This discussion on the intersection of population growth, resource availability and use, economic growth, quality of life, and environmental sustainability&nbsp;&ndash; referred to as the \"global problematique\"&nbsp;&ndash; came to wide public attention with the publication of ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', a study sponsored by the [[Club of Rome]] which detailed the results of a computer simulation of the future based on economic and population growth.[[Futures studies#cite note-Meadows 1972-22|<sup>[22]</sup>]] Public investment in the future was further enhanced by the publication of [[Alvin Toffler]]\u2019s bestseller ''[[Future Shock]]'' (1970), and its exploration of how great amounts of change can overwhelm people and create a social paralysis due to \u201cinformation overload.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Further development===\nInternational dialogue became institutionalized in the form of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]] (WFSF), founded in 1967, with the noted sociologist, [[Johan Galtung]], serving as its first president. In the United States, the publisher [[Edward Cornish]], concerned with these issues, started the [[World Future Society]], an organization focused more on interested laypeople.  The [http://apf.org Association of Professional Futurists] was founded in 2002 and spans 40 countries with more than 400 members.  Their mission is to promote professional excellence by \u201cdemonstrating the value of strategic foresight and futures studies.\u201d\n\nThe first doctoral program on the Study of the Future, was founded in 1969 at the University Of Massachusetts by Christopher Dede and Billy Rojas.

At present however, science has yielded only a special minority of such \"easy to predict\" physical processes. Theories such as [[chaos theory]], [[nonlinear]] science and standard [[evolutionary theory]] have allowed us to understand many complex systems as [[contingent]] (sensitively dependent on complex environmental conditions) and [[stochastic]] (random within constraints), making the vast majority of future events unpredictable, ''in any specific case''.\n\nNot surprisingly, the tension between [[predictability]] and [[unpredictability]] is a source of controversy and conflict among futures studies scholars and practitioners. Some argue that the future is essentially unpredictable, and that \"the best way to predict the future is to create it.\" Others believe, as Flechtheim, that advances in science, probability, modeling and statistics will allow us to continue to improve our understanding of probable futures, as this area presently remains less well developed than methods for exploring possible and preferable futures.\n\nAs an example, consider the process of electing the president of the United States. At one level we observe that any U.S. citizen over 35 may run for president, so this process may appear too unconstrained for useful prediction. Yet further investigation demonstrates that only certain public individuals (current and former presidents and vice presidents, senators, state governors, popular military commanders, mayors of very large cities, celebrities, etc.) receive the appropriate \"social credentials\" that are historical prerequisites for election. Thus, with a minimum of effort at formulating the problem for statistical prediction, a much-reduced pool of candidates can be described, improving our probabilistic foresight. Applying further statistical intelligence to this problem, we can observe that in certain election [[prediction market]]s such as the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]], reliable forecasts have been generated over long spans of time and conditions, with results superior to individual experts or polls. Such markets, which may be operated publicly or as an [[internal market]], are just one of several promising frontiers in predictive futures research.\n\nSuch improvements in the predictability of individual events do not though, from a [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] viewpoint, address the unpredictability inherent in dealing with entire systems, which emerge from the interaction between multiple individual events.\n\nFuturology is sometimes described by scientists as [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=\"Oxford\"/><ref name=\"Williams\"/> Science exists in the realm of the certain and builds knowledge through attempting to falsify predictions.\u00a0 Futures studies, however, exists in the realm of the uncertain but also builds knowledge through attempting to falsify predictions and exposing uncertainty.<ref name=\":3\" />\u00a0 So in a sense, both science and futures studies share the same goal. The difference is that futures studies attempts to understand, mitigate, and utilize uncertainty.\n\n==Methodologies==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|section|date=November 2015}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n}}\nIn terms of methodology, futures practitioners employ a wide range of approaches, models and methods, in both theory and practice, many of which are derived from or informed by other academic or professional disciplines [https://books.google.com/books?id=ILJ_pfMgLqsC&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=futurists+borrow+from+other+disciplines&source=bl&ots=ycoWOEgcIS&sig=J-Nv6SzqAv-DLsGc7608ZuPyV5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi31u3GgMHSAhXpj1QKHUxBCOAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=futurists%20borrow%2 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>], including social sciences such as economics, psychology, sociology, religious studies, cultural studies, history, geography, and political science; physical and life sciences such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology; mathematics, including statistics, game theory and econometrics; applied disciplines such as engineering, computer sciences, and business management (particularly strategy).\n\nThe largest internationally peer-reviewed collection of futures research methods (1,300 pages) is [http://www.millennium-project.org/publications-2/futures-research-methodology-version-3-0/ Futures Research Methodology 3.0]. Each of the 37 methods or groups of methods contains: an executive overview of each method's history, description of the method, primary and alternative usages, strengths and weaknesses, uses in combination with other methods, and speculation about future evolution of the method. Some also contain appendixes with applications, links to software, and sources for further information.\n\nGiven its unique objectives and material, the practice of futures studies only rarely features employment of the [[scientific method]] in the sense of controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing from history, the futurist might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing from technology, the futurist may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.\n\nAs the plural term \u201cfutures\u201d suggests, one of the fundamental assumptions in futures studies is that the future is plural not singular.[http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/publications/futures-studies/DatorFuturesStudies.pdf <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>] That is, the future consists not of one inevitable future that is to be \u201cpredicted,\u201d but rather of multiple alternative futures of varying likelihood which may be derived and described, and about which it is impossible to say with certainty which one will occur. The primary effort in futures studies, then, is to identify and describe alternative futures in order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects. The exercise of identifying alternative futures includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plural term \"futures\" in futures studies denotes both the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied, as well as the tenet that the future is many.\n\nAt present, the general futures studies model has been summarized as being concerned with \"three Ps and a W\", or possible, probable, and preferable futures, plus [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wildcards]], which are low probability but high impact events (positive or negative). Many futurists, however, do not use the wild card approach. Rather, they use a methodology called [[Emerging Issues Analysis]]. It searches for the drivers of change, issues that are likely to move from unknown to the known, from low impact to high impact.\n\nIn terms of technique, futures practitioners originally concentrated on [[Extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], [[economic]] or [[social]] [[Fads and trends|trends]], or on attempting to [[Prediction|predict]] future trends. Over time, the discipline has come to put more and more focus on the examination of social [[system]]s and [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]], to the end of articulating [[Scenario planning|scenarios]]. The practice of scenario development facilitates the examination of worldviews and assumptions through the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others), the creation of preferred visions of the future, and the use of exercises such as [[backcasting]] to connect the present with alternative futures. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research (see below).\n\nThe general practice of futures studies also sometimes includes the articulation of normative or preferred futures, and a major thread of practice involves connecting both extrapolated (exploratory) and normative research to assist individuals and organizations to model preferred futures amid shifting social changes. Practitioners use varying proportions of collaboration, creativity and research to derive and define alternative futures, and to the degree that a \u201cpreferred\u201d future might be sought, especially in an organizational context, techniques may also be deployed to develop plans or strategies for directed future shaping or implementation of a preferred future.\n\nWhile some futurists are not concerned with assigning probability to future scenarios, other futurists find probabilities useful in certain situations, such as when probabilities stimulate thinking about scenarios within organizations [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2870/f9cef0b618c480312802fbb78e49bd69fa83.pdf <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]. When dealing with the three Ps and a W model, estimates of probability are involved with two of the four central concerns (discerning and classifying both probable and wildcard events), while considering the range of possible futures, recognizing the plurality of existing alternative futures, characterizing and attempting to resolve normative disagreements on the future, and envisioning and creating preferred futures are other major areas of scholarship. Most estimates of probability in futures studies are normative and qualitative, though significant progress on statistical and quantitative methods (technology and information growth curves, cliometrics, predictive psychology, [[prediction market]]s, crowd-voting forecasts,<sup>[31][''[[Wikipedia:NOTRS|better source needed]]'']</sup> etc.) has been made in recent decades.\n\n=== Futures techniques ===\n{{Main|Futures techniques}}\n\nFutures techniques or methodologies may be viewed as \u201cframeworks for making sense of data generated by structured processes to think about the future\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/768c/525942ae89e6364569875090b87b449abeb2.pdf|title=An Overview of Foresight Methodologies|last=Conway|first=Maree|date=|website=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref> There is no single set of methods that are appropriate for all futures research.

Selection of methods for use on futures research projects has so far been dominated by the intuition and insight of practitioners; but can better identify a balanced selection of techniques via acknowledgement of foresight as a process together with familiarity with the fundamental attributes of most commonly used methods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Popper|first=Rafael|date=2008|title=How are foresight methods selected?|url=|journal=Foresight|volume=10|issue=6|pages=62\u201389|doi=10.1108/14636680810918586}}</ref>\nScenarios are a central technique in Futures Studies and are often confused with other techniques.

To some extent, people can determine what they consider probable or desirable using qualitative and quantitative methods. By looking at a variety of possibilities one comes closer to shaping the future, rather than merely predicting it. Shaping alternative futures starts by establishing a number of scenarios. Setting up scenarios takes place as a process with many stages. One of those stages involves the study of trends. A trend persists long-term and long-range; it affects many societal groups, grows slowly and appears to have a profound basis. In contrast, a fad operates in the short term, shows the vagaries of [[fashion]], affects particular societal groups, and spreads quickly but superficially.\n\nSample predicted futures range from predicted [[ecological catastrophe]]s, through a [[utopia]]n future where the poorest human being lives in what present-day observers would regard as wealth and comfort, through the transformation of humanity into a [[posthumanism|posthuman]] life-form, to the destruction of all life on Earth in, say, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] [[Grey Goo|disaster]].\n\nFuturists have a decidedly mixed reputation and a patchy track record at successful prediction. For reasons of convenience, they often extrapolate present technical and societal trends and assume they will develop at the same rate into the future; but technical progress and social upheavals, in reality, take place in fits and starts and in different areas at different rates.\n\nMany 1950s futurists predicted commonplace [[space tourism]] by the year 2000, but ignored the possibilities of ubiquitous, cheap [[computer]]s. On the other hand, many forecasts have portrayed the future with some degree of accuracy. Current futurists often present multiple [[scenario]]s that help their audience envision what \"may\" occur instead of merely \"predicting the future\". They claim that understanding potential scenarios helps individuals and organizations prepare with flexibility.\n\nMany corporations use futurists as part of their [[risk management]] strategy, for [[horizon scanning]] and emerging issues analysis, and to identify [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wild card]]s &ndash; low probability, potentially high-impact risks.<ref>A [http://www.globalchange.com/ppt4/risk/ sample presentation on risk management]</ref> Every successful and unsuccessful [[business]] engages in futuring to some degree &ndash; for example in research and development, innovation and market research, anticipating competitor behavior and so on.<ref name=\"rohrbeck-2010\">Rohrbeck, Rene (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm'', Springer Series: Contributions to Management Science, Heidelberg and New York, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2625-8}}</ref><ref name=\"rohrbeck-gemuenden-2010\">Rohrbeck, R.

There is some confusion about the definition of weak signal by various researchers and consultants. Sometimes it is referred as future oriented information, sometimes more like emerging issues. The confusion has been partly clarified with the concept 'the future sign', by separating signal, issue and interpretation of the future sign.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V65-4PJM9RS-2&_user=10&_coverDate=09%2F01%2F2007&_rdoc=29&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235805%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=5805&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=46&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=96d64e0a3f418f2a3fafc73da9c8f774 article about the Future sign]{{dead link|date=March 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nA weak signal can be an early indicator of coming change, and an example might also help clarify the confusion. On May 27, 2012, hundreds of people gathered for a \u201cTake the Flour Back\u201d demonstration at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK, to oppose a publicly funded trial of genetically modified wheat. This was a weak signal for a broader shift in consumer sentiment against genetically modified foods. When Whole Foods mandated the labeling of GMOs in 2013, this non-GMO idea had already become a trend and was about to be a topic of mainstream awareness.\n\n\"Wild cards\" refer to low-probability and high-impact events \"that happen quickly\" and \"have huge sweeping consequences,\" and materialize too quickly for social systems to effectively respond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hiltunen|first=Elina|date=November 2006|title=Was it Wild Card or Just Our Blindness to Gradual Change?|url=|journal=Journal of Futures Studies|volume=11(2)|pages=61\u201374|via=}}</ref>  Oliver Markley proposed four types of wild cards:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Markley|first=Oliver|date=2011|title=A new methodology for anticipating STEEP surprises|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting & Social Change|volume=78(2011)|pages=1079\u20131097|via=}}</ref>\n\n* Type I Wild Card: low probability, high impact, high credibility\n* Type II Wild Card: high probability, high impact, low credibility\n* Type III Wild Card: high probability, high impact, disputed credibility\n* Type IV Wild Card: high probability, high impact, high credibility\n\nHe posits that it is important to track the emergence of \"Type II Wild Cards\" that have a high probability of occurring, but low credibility that it will happen.  This focus is especially important to note because it is often difficult to persuade people to accept something they don't believe is happening, until they see the wild card.  An example is climate change.  This hypothesis has gone from Type I (high impact and high credibility, but low probability where science was accepted and thought unlikely to happen) to Type II (high probability, high impact, but low credibility as policy makers and lobbyists push back against the science), to Type III (high probability, high impact, high credibility)--at least for most people,  There are still some who probably will not accept the science until the Greenland ice sheet has completely melted and sea-level has risen the seven meters estimated rise.\n\nThis concept may be embedded in standard foresight projects and introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of social groups adapt to surprises arising in turbulent business environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which relevant foresight information might be inferred. Sometimes, mistakenly, wild cards and weak signals are considered as synonyms, which they are not.<ref>[http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/11-2/4wildcard-hiltunen.pdf differences of weak signals and wild cards]</ref> One of the most often cited examples of a wild card event in recent history is 9/11. Nothing had happened in the past that could point to such a possibility and yet it had a huge impact on everyday life in the United States, from simple tasks like how to travel via airplane to deeper cultural values. Wild card events might also be natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which can force the relocation of huge populations and wipe out entire crops or completely disrupt the supply chain of many businesses. Although wild card events can't be predicted, after they occur it is often easy to reflect back and convincingly explain why they happened.\n\n===Near-term predictions===\nA long-running tradition in various [[culture]]s, and especially in the [[Mass media|media]], involves various spokespersons making predictions for the upcoming year at the beginning of the year. These [[prediction]]s sometimes base themselves on current trends in culture (music, movies, fashion, politics); sometimes they make hopeful guesses as to what major events might take place over the course of the next year.\n\nSome of these predictions come true as the year unfolds, though many fail. When predicted events fail to take place, the authors of the [[prediction]]s often state that misinterpretation of the \"[[sign (semiotics)|signs]]\" and [[Portent (divination)|portent]]s may explain the failure of the prediction.\n\n[[Marketing|Marketer]]s have increasingly started to embrace futures studies, in an effort to benefit from an increasingly competitive marketplace with fast production cycles, using such techniques as [[trend analysis|trendspotting]] as popularized by [[Faith Popcorn]].{{Dubious|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Trend analysis and forecasting ===\n\n==== Mega-trends ====\nTrends come in different sizes. A mega-trend extends over many generations, and in cases of climate, mega-trends can cover periods prior to human existence. They describe complex interactions between many factors. The increase in population from the [[palaeolithic]] period to the present provides an example. Mega-trends are likely to produce greater change than any previous one, because technology is causing trends to unfold at an accelerating pace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=Leslie P.|date=Dec 27, 2019|title=The 2020s Will Bring Massive Change. Why Society Might Not Be Ready|url=|journal=Barron's|volume=(Online); New York (Dec 27, 2019)|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref> The concept was popularized by the 1982 book Megatrends by futurist [[John Naisbitt]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Naisbitt |first1=John |title=Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives. Warner Books |date=1982 |publisher=Warner Communications |isbn=978-0-446-35681-7}}</ref>\n\n==== Potential trends ====\nPossible new trends grow from innovations, projects, beliefs or actions that have the potential to grow and eventually go mainstream in the future.\n\n==== Branching trends ====\nVery often, trends relate to one another the same way as a tree-trunk relates to branches and twigs. For example, a well-documented movement toward equality between men and women might represent a branch trend. The trend toward reducing differences in the salaries of men and women in the [[Western world]] could form a twig on that branch.\n\n==== Life-cycle of a trend ====\nUnderstanding the technology adoption cycle helps futurists monitor trend development. Trends start as weak signals by small mentions in fringe media outlets, discussion conversations or blog posts, often by innovators. As these ideas, projects, beliefs or technologies gain acceptance, they move into the phase of early adopters.  \nIn the beginning of a trend's development, it is difficult to tell if it will become a significant trend that creates changes or merely a trendy fad that fades into forgotten history.  Trends will emerge as initially unconnected dots but eventually coalesce into persistent change.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Amy |title=The Signals Are Talking |date=2016 |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |isbn=9781610396660 |pages=47\u201350 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nSome trends emerge when enough confirmation occurs in the various media, surveys or questionnaires to show that it has an increasingly accepted value, behavior or technology, it becomes accepted as a bona fide trend. Trends can also gain confirmation by the existence of other trends perceived as springing from the same branch. Some commentators claim that when 15% to 25% of a given population integrates an innovation, project, belief or action into their daily life then a trend becomes mainstream.\n\n[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|[[Hype cycle|General Hype Cycle]] used to visualize [[Technology adoption life cycle|technological life stages]] of maturity, adoption, and social application.]]\n\n==== Life cycle of technologies ====\n\n[[Gartner]] created their [[Hype cycle|Hype Cycle]] to illustrate the phases a technology moves through as it grows from research and development to mainstream adoption. The unrealistic expectations and subsequent disillusionment that virtual reality experienced in the 1990s and early 2000s is an example of the middle phases encountered before a technology can begin to be integrated into society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/blog/keynote-remixed-what-happened-to-virtual-reality/|title=Keynote Remixed: What Happened to Virtual Reality|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nEducation in the field of futures studies has taken place for some time. Beginning in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, it has since developed in many different countries. Futures education encourages the use of concepts, tools and processes that allow students to think long-term, consequentially, and imaginatively. It generally helps students to:\n# conceptualize more just and sustainable human and planetary futures.\n# develop knowledge and skills of methods and tools used to help people understand, map, and influence the future by exploring probable and preferred futures.\n# understand the dynamics and influence that human, social and ecological systems have on alternative futures.\n# conscientize [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and action on the part of students toward creating better futures.\nThorough documentation of the history of futures education exists, for example in the work of [[Richard A. Slaughter]] (2004),<ref name=\"Slaughter 2004\">{{cite book| last=Slaughter| first= Richard A.| year=2004| title=Futures Beyond Dystopia: Creating Social Foresight| publisher=RoutledgeFalmer| location=London}}</ref> David Hicks, Ivana Milojevi\u0107<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |title=Articles by Ivana Milojevic; Futures Studies at Metafuture.org |work=metafuture.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114063552/http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |archivedate=2009-11-14 }}</ref> to name a few.\n\nWhile futures studies remains a relatively new academic tradition, numerous tertiary institutions around the world teach it. These vary from small programs, or universities with just one or two classes, to programs that offer certificates and incorporate futures studies into other degrees, (for example in [[planning]], business, environmental studies, [[economics]], development studies, [[science]] and technology studies). Various formal Masters-level programs exist on six continents. Finally, doctoral dissertations around the world have incorporated futures studies (see e.g. Rohrbeck, 2010;<ref>Rohrbeck, R. (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm''. [[Dissertation]].

A recent survey documented approximately 50 cases of futures studies at the tertiary level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfsf.org|title=HOME|author=Super User|work=wfsf.org}}</ref>\n\nA Futures Studies program is offered at [[Tamkang University]], Taiwan. Futures Studies is a required course at the undergraduate level, with between three and five thousand students taking classes on an annual basis. Housed in the Graduate Institute of Futures Studies is an MA Program. Only ten students are accepted annually in the program.

Several government agencies publish material for internal stakeholders as well as make that material available to broader public. Examples of this include the US Congressional Budget Office long term budget projections,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45308|title=Long-Term Budget Projections|work=Congressional Budget Office}}</ref> the National Intelligence Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|title=National Intelligence Council|author=Super User|work=dni.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301030845/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|archivedate=2015-03-01}}</ref> and the United Kingdom Government Office for Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/foresight-projects|title=Foresight projects|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref> Much of this material is used by policy makers to inform policy decisions and government agencies to develop long-term plan. Several corporations, particularly those with long product development lifecycles, utilize foresight and future studies products and practitioners in the development of their business strategies. The Shell Corporation is one such entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |title=Shell Scenarios |work=shell.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307044027/http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |archivedate=2015-03-07 }}</ref> Foresight professionals and their tools are increasingly being used in both the private and public areas to help leaders deal with an increasingly complex and interconnected world.\n\n===Design===\nDesign and futures studies have many synergies as interdisciplinary fields with a natural orientation towards the future. Both incorporate studies of human behavior, global trends,  strategic insights, and anticipatory solutions.\n\nDesigners have adopted futures methodologies including scenarios, trend forecasting, and futures research. Design thinking and specific techniques including ethnography, rapid prototyping, and critical design have been incorporated into in futures as well. In addition to borrowing techniques from one another, futurists and designers have joined to form agencies marrying both competencies to positive effect. The continued interrelation of the two fields is an encouraging trend that has spawned much interesting work.\n\nThe Association for Professional Futurists has also held meetings discussing the ways in which Design Thinking and Futures Thinking intersect and benefit one another.\n\n===Imperial cycles and world order===\n\nImperial cycles represent an \"expanding pulsation\" of \"mathematically describable\" macro-historic trend.<ref>Hornell Hart, \"The Logistic Growth of Political Areas,\" ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-7; [[Raoul Naroll]], \"Imperial Cycles and World Order,\" ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 100-101.</ref> The [[List of largest empires]] contains imperial record progression in terms of territory or percentage of world population under single imperial rule.\n\nChinese philosopher [[K'ang Yu-wei]] and French demographer [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] in the late 19th century were the first to stress that the trend cannot proceed indefinitely on the definite surface of the globe. The trend is bound to culminate in a world empire. K'ang Yu-wei estimated that the matter will be decided in the contest between Washington and Berlin; Vacher de Lapouge foresaw this contest between the United States and Russia and estimated the chance of the United States higher.<ref>[[K'ang Yu-wei]], ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr.

G. Wells]] introduced the science of future in his ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1901).\n\nFour later anthropologists\u2014Hornell Hart, [[Raoul Naroll]], Louis Morano, and [[Robert Carneiro]]\u2014researched the expanding imperial cycles. They reached the same conclusion that a world empire is not only pre-determined but close at hand and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance.<ref>Hornell, Hart, \"The Logistic Growth of Political Areas,\" ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-408;  \nRaoul, Naroll, \"Imperial Cycles and World Order,\" ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 83-101;\nLouis A., Marano, \"A Macrohistoric Trend Towards World Government\", ''Behavior Science Notes'', 8, (1973): 35-40;\nRobert Carneiro, \"Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion\", ''Studying War: Anthropological Perspective'', eds.

A foresight project begins with a question that ponders the future of any given subject area, including technology, medicine, government and business. Futurists engage in environmental scanning to search for drivers of change and emerging trends that may have an effect on the focus topic. The scanning process includes reviewing social media platforms, researching already prepared reports, engaging in Delphi studies, reading articles and any other sources of relevant information and preparing and analyzing data extrapolations. Then, through one of a number of highly structured methods<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Andy |title=Framework foresight for exploring emerging student needs |journal=On the Horizon |date=14 August 2017 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=145\u2013156 |doi=10.1108/OTH-03-2017-0013}}</ref> futurists organize this information and use it to create multiple future scenarios for the topic, also known as a domain.

Futures studies (colloquially called \"'''futures'''\" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change.

It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in an attempt to develop foresight. Around the world the field is variously referred to as '''futures studies''', '''[[strategic foresight]]''', '''futuristics''', '''futures thinking''', '''futuring''', and '''futurology'''. Futures studies and strategic foresight are the academic field's most commonly used terms in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world.<ref name=\"Sardar, Z. 2010 pp. 177\"/>\n\n'''Foresight''' was the original term and was first used in this sense by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1932.<ref name=\"Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91\">Wells, H.G. (1932) 1987. Wanted: Professors of Foresight! ''Futures Research Quarterly'' V3N1 (Spring): p. 89-91.</ref> \"Futurology\" is a term common in encyclopedias, though it is used almost exclusively by nonpractitioners today, at least in the English-speaking world. \"Futurology\" is defined as the \"study of the future.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|title=SCIENCE GLOSSARY|work=tripod.com|access-date=2007-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506011318/http://nandankanan.tripod.com/scienceterms.htm|archive-date=2007-05-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The term was coined by [[German people|German]] professor [[Ossip K. Flechtheim]] in the mid-1940s, who proposed it as a new branch of knowledge that would include a new science of [[probability]]. This term has fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Peter |last2=Hines |first2=Andy |title=Teaching about the Future |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Houndsmill, UK |isbn=978-0230363496}}</ref>\n\nThree factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all of these disciplines overlap, to differing degrees). First, futures studies often examines trends to compose possible, probable, and preferable futures along with the role \"wild cards\" can play on future scenarios. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a [[Holism|holistic]] or [[systemics|systemic]] view based on insights from a range of different disciplines, generally focusing on the STEEP<ref>{{cite web|title=What is STEEP Analysis?|url=http://pestleanalysis.com/what-is-steep-analysis/|website=PESTLE Analysis|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2015-02-11}}</ref> categories of Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental and Political. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions. For example, many people expect the collapse of the Earth's ecosystem in the near future, while others believe the current ecosystem will survive indefinitely. A foresight approach would seek to analyze and highlight the assumptions underpinning such views.\n\nAs a field, futures studies expands on the research component, by emphasizing the communication of a strategy and the actionable steps needed to implement the plan or plans leading to the preferable future.  It is in this regard, that futures studies evolves from an academic exercise to a more traditional business-like practice, looking to better prepare organizations for the future.\n\nFutures studies does not generally focus on short term predictions such as [[interest rate]]s over the next [[business cycle]], or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops goals and objectives with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. Plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate possible future events are definitely part of the field.  As a rule, futures studies is generally concerned with changes of transformative impact, rather than those of an incremental or narrow scope.\n\nThe futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed [[supernatural]] means.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|215x215px|[[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], originator of the 'Utopian' ideal.]]\n[[Johan Galtung]] and [[Sohail Inayatullah]]<ref>Galtung, Johan and Inayatullah, Sohail (1997). ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians''. Westport, Ct: Praeger.</ref> argue in ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians'' that the search for grand patterns of social change goes all the way back to [[Sima Qian|Ssu-Ma Chien]] (145-90BC) and his theory of the cycles of virtue, although the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332\u20131406) such as ''The Muqaddimah''<ref>Khaldun, Ibn (1967), ''The Muqaddimah'', Trans. Franz Rosenthal, ed. N.J. Dawood. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]</ref> would be an example that is perhaps more intelligible to modern sociology. Early western examples include [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]]\u2019s \u201c[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]],\u201d published in 1516, and based upon Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic,\u201d in which a future society has overcome poverty and misery to create a perfect model for living. This work was so powerful that utopias have come to represent positive and fulfilling futures in which everyone's needs are met.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/predictions/futures%20studies%20timeline.pdf|title=Futures Studies Timeline|last=Anderson|first=Janna|date=|website=www.elon.edu|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome intellectual foundations of futures studies appeared in the mid-19th century. Isadore [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], considered the father of scientific philosophy, was heavily influenced by the work of utopian socialist [[Henri de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]], and his discussion of the metapatterns of [[social change]] presages futures studies as a scholarly [[dialogue]].<ref name=\"Bell 1997\">{{cite book| last=Bell| first=Wendell| year=1997| title=Foundations of Futures Studies: Human Science for a New Era| publisher=Transaction Publishers| location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA | isbn=978-1-56000-271-0}}</ref>\n\nThe first works that attempt to make systematic predictions for the future were written in the 18th century. ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' written by [[Samuel Madden]] in 1733, takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998 from British representatives in the foreign cities of [[Constantinople]], [[Rome]], [[Paris]], and [[Moscow]].<ref>\"Samuel Madden's ''Memoirs of the Twentieth Century''\" Paul Alkon. ''Science Fiction Studies'' Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jul., 1985), pp. 184-201 Published by: SF-TH Inc</ref> However, the technology of the 20th century is identical to that of Madden's own era - the focus is instead on the political and religious state of the world in the future. Madden went on to write ''The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925'', where (in the context of the [[History of the British canal system|boom in canal construction at the time]]) he envisioned a large network of waterways that would radically transform patterns of living - \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/nov/06/features11.g21|title=And now for the forecast|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2000-11-06|last1=Margolis|first1=Jonathan}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Scientific American]], the oldest continuously published magazine in the U.S., began publishing articles about scientific and technological research, with a focus upon the future implications of such research. It would be followed in 1872 by the magazine [[Popular Science]], which was aimed at a more general readership.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe genre of [[science fiction]] became established towards the end of the 19th century, with notable writers, including [[Jules Verne]] and [[H.

From this havoc would ultimately emerge a world of peace and plenty, controlled by competent [[technocrat]]s.<ref name=\"Wagar\"/>\n\nThe work was a [[bestseller]], and Wells was invited to deliver a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1902, entitled ''[[The Discovery of the Future]]''. The lecture was well-received and was soon republished in book form. He advocated for the establishment of a new academic study of the future that would be grounded in scientific methodology rather than just speculation. He argued that a scientifically ordered vision of the future \"will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred years to make the geological past.\" Although conscious of the difficulty in arriving at entirely accurate predictions, he thought that it would still be possible to arrive at a \"working knowledge of things in the future\".<ref name=\"Wagar\"/>\n\nIn his fictional works, Wells predicted the invention and use of the [[atomic bomb]] in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914).<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard Rhodes | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | url = https://archive.org/details/makingofatomicbo00rhod | url-access = registration | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | page = [https://archive.org/details/makingofatomicbo00rhod/page/24 24] | isbn = 978-0-684-81378-3| author-link = Richard Rhodes }}</ref> In ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933) the impending [[World War II|World War]] and cities destroyed by aerial bombardment was depicted.<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. \"Outline of Wells's History.\" ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (p. 22\u201323).</ref> However, he didn't stop advocating for the establishment of a futures science. In a 1933 [[BBC]] broadcast he called for the establishment of \"Departments and Professors of Foresight\", foreshadowing the development of modern academic futures studies by approximately 40 years.<ref name=\"Wells, H.G. 1932 p. 89-91\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century future works were often shaped by political forces and turmoil. The [[World War I|WWI]] era led to adoption of futures thinking in institutions throughout Europe. The [[Russian Revolution]] led to the 1921 establishment of the Soviet Union's [[Gosplan]], or State Planning Committee, which was active until the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]]. Gosplan was responsible for economic planning and created plans in five year increments to govern the economy. One of the first Soviet dissidents, [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], published the first [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', in 1921. The science fiction and political satire featured a future police state and was the first work censored by the Soviet censorship board, leading to Zamyatin's political exile.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the United States, President [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] created the Research Committee on Social Trends, which produced a report in 1933. The head of the committee, [[William Fielding Ogburn|William F. Ogburn]], analyzed the past to chart trends and project those trends into the future, with a focus on technology. Similar technique was used during [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]], with the addition of alternative futures and a set of likely outcomes that resulted in the creation of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and the Tennessee Valley development project.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[World War II|WWII]] era emphasized the growing need for foresight. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] used strategic plans to unify and mobilize their society with a focus on creating a fascist utopia. This planning and the subsequent war forced global leaders to create their own strategic plans in response. The post-war era saw the creation of numerous nation states with complex political alliances and was further complicated by the introduction of nuclear power.\n\n[[RAND Corporation|Project RAND]] was created in 1946 as joint project between the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], and later incorporated as the non-profit [[RAND Corporation|RAND corporation]]. Their objective was the future of weapons, and long-range planning to meet future threats. Their work has formed the basis of US strategy and policy in regard to nuclear weapons, the [[Cold War]], and the          space race.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Mid-Century Emergence===\nFutures studies truly emerged as an academic discipline in the mid-1960s.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://wfs.org/five-decades-of-futuring/|title=World Future Society|author=|date=|website=World Future Society|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> First-generation futurists included [[Herman Kahn]], an American [[Cold War]] strategist for the [[RAND Corporation]] who wrote ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' (1960), ''Thinking about the unthinkable'' (1962) and ''The Year 2000: a framework for speculation on the next thirty-three years'' (1967); [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]], a French economist who founded [[Futuribles International]] in 1960; and [[Dennis Gabor]], a Hungarian-British scientist who wrote ''Inventing the Future'' (1963) and ''The Mature Society. A View of the Future'' (1972).<ref name=\"Bell 1997\" />\n\nFuture studies had a parallel origin with the birth of [[systems science]] in [[academia]], and with the idea of national economic and political [[planning]], most notably in [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Bell 1997\"/><ref name=\"Masini 1993\">{{cite book| last=Masini| first= Eleonora| year=1993| title=Why Futures Studies?| publisher=Grey Seal Books| location=London, UK}}</ref> In the 1950s, the people of France were continuing to reconstruct their war-torn country. In the process, French scholars, philosophers, writers, and artists searched for what could constitute a more positive future for humanity. The [[Soviet Union]] similarly participated in postwar rebuilding, but did so in the context of an established [[Planned economy|national economic planning process]], which also required a long-term, systemic statement of social goals. Future studies was therefore primarily engaged in national planning, and the construction of national symbols.\n[[File:Rachel Carson w (cropped).jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Rachel Carson]], author of [[Silent Spring|''The Silent Spring'']], which helped launch the environmental movement and a new direction for futures research.]]\nBy contrast, in the [[United States]], futures studies as a discipline emerged from the successful application of the tools and perspectives of [[systems analysis]], especially with regard to quartermastering the war-effort.

Several of the most notable writers to emerge during this era include: sociologist [[Fred Polak|Fred L. Polak]], whose work ''Images of the Future'' (1961) discusses the importance of images to society's creation of the future; [[Marshall McLuhan]], whose ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) and ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) put forth his theories on how technologies change our cognitive understanding; and [[Rachel Carson]]\u2019s ''[[Silent Spring|The Silent Spring]]'' (1962) which was hugely influential not only to future studies but also the creation of the environmental movement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInventors such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] also began highlighting the effect technology might have on global trends as time progressed.\n\nBy the 1970s there was an obvious shift in the use and development of futures studies; its focus was no longer exclusive to governments and militaries. Instead, it embraced a wide array of technologies, social issues, and concerns. This discussion on the intersection of population growth, resource availability and use, economic growth, quality of life, and environmental sustainability&nbsp;&ndash; referred to as the \"global problematique\"&nbsp;&ndash; came to wide public attention with the publication of ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', a study sponsored by the [[Club of Rome]] which detailed the results of a computer simulation of the future based on economic and population growth.[[Futures studies#cite note-Meadows 1972-22|<sup>[22]</sup>]] Public investment in the future was further enhanced by the publication of [[Alvin Toffler]]\u2019s bestseller ''[[Future Shock]]'' (1970), and its exploration of how great amounts of change can overwhelm people and create a social paralysis due to \u201cinformation overload.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Further development===\nInternational dialogue became institutionalized in the form of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]] (WFSF), founded in 1967, with the noted sociologist, [[Johan Galtung]], serving as its first president. In the United States, the publisher [[Edward Cornish]], concerned with these issues, started the [[World Future Society]], an organization focused more on interested laypeople.  The [http://apf.org Association of Professional Futurists] was founded in 2002 and spans 40 countries with more than 400 members.  Their mission is to promote professional excellence by \u201cdemonstrating the value of strategic foresight and futures studies.\u201d\n\nThe first doctoral program on the Study of the Future, was founded in 1969 at the University Of Massachusetts by Christopher Dede and Billy Rojas.

At present however, science has yielded only a special minority of such \"easy to predict\" physical processes. Theories such as [[chaos theory]], [[nonlinear]] science and standard [[evolutionary theory]] have allowed us to understand many complex systems as [[contingent]] (sensitively dependent on complex environmental conditions) and [[stochastic]] (random within constraints), making the vast majority of future events unpredictable, ''in any specific case''.\n\nNot surprisingly, the tension between [[predictability]] and [[unpredictability]] is a source of controversy and conflict among futures studies scholars and practitioners. Some argue that the future is essentially unpredictable, and that \"the best way to predict the future is to create it.\" Others believe, as Flechtheim, that advances in science, probability, modeling and statistics will allow us to continue to improve our understanding of probable futures, as this area presently remains less well developed than methods for exploring possible and preferable futures.\n\nAs an example, consider the process of electing the president of the United States. At one level we observe that any U.S. citizen over 35 may run for president, so this process may appear too unconstrained for useful prediction. Yet further investigation demonstrates that only certain public individuals (current and former presidents and vice presidents, senators, state governors, popular military commanders, mayors of very large cities, celebrities, etc.) receive the appropriate \"social credentials\" that are historical prerequisites for election. Thus, with a minimum of effort at formulating the problem for statistical prediction, a much-reduced pool of candidates can be described, improving our probabilistic foresight. Applying further statistical intelligence to this problem, we can observe that in certain election [[prediction market]]s such as the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]], reliable forecasts have been generated over long spans of time and conditions, with results superior to individual experts or polls. Such markets, which may be operated publicly or as an [[internal market]], are just one of several promising frontiers in predictive futures research.\n\nSuch improvements in the predictability of individual events do not though, from a [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] viewpoint, address the unpredictability inherent in dealing with entire systems, which emerge from the interaction between multiple individual events.\n\nFuturology is sometimes described by scientists as [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=\"Oxford\"/><ref name=\"Williams\"/> Science exists in the realm of the certain and builds knowledge through attempting to falsify predictions.\u00a0 Futures studies, however, exists in the realm of the uncertain but also builds knowledge through attempting to falsify predictions and exposing uncertainty.<ref name=\":3\" />\u00a0 So in a sense, both science and futures studies share the same goal. The difference is that futures studies attempts to understand, mitigate, and utilize uncertainty.\n\n==Methodologies==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|section|date=November 2015}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n}}\nIn terms of methodology, futures practitioners employ a wide range of approaches, models and methods, in both theory and practice, many of which are derived from or informed by other academic or professional disciplines [https://books.google.com/books?id=ILJ_pfMgLqsC&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=futurists+borrow+from+other+disciplines&source=bl&ots=ycoWOEgcIS&sig=J-Nv6SzqAv-DLsGc7608ZuPyV5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi31u3GgMHSAhXpj1QKHUxBCOAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=futurists%20borrow%2 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>], including social sciences such as economics, psychology, sociology, religious studies, cultural studies, history, geography, and political science; physical and life sciences such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology; mathematics, including statistics, game theory and econometrics; applied disciplines such as engineering, computer sciences, and business management (particularly strategy).\n\nThe largest internationally peer-reviewed collection of futures research methods (1,300 pages) is [http://www.millennium-project.org/publications-2/futures-research-methodology-version-3-0/ Futures Research Methodology 3.0]. Each of the 37 methods or groups of methods contains: an executive overview of each method's history, description of the method, primary and alternative usages, strengths and weaknesses, uses in combination with other methods, and speculation about future evolution of the method. Some also contain appendixes with applications, links to software, and sources for further information.\n\nGiven its unique objectives and material, the practice of futures studies only rarely features employment of the [[scientific method]] in the sense of controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing from history, the futurist might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing from technology, the futurist may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.\n\nAs the plural term \u201cfutures\u201d suggests, one of the fundamental assumptions in futures studies is that the future is plural not singular.[http://www.futures.hawaii.edu/publications/futures-studies/DatorFuturesStudies.pdf <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>] That is, the future consists not of one inevitable future that is to be \u201cpredicted,\u201d but rather of multiple alternative futures of varying likelihood which may be derived and described, and about which it is impossible to say with certainty which one will occur. The primary effort in futures studies, then, is to identify and describe alternative futures in order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects. The exercise of identifying alternative futures includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plural term \"futures\" in futures studies denotes both the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied, as well as the tenet that the future is many.\n\nAt present, the general futures studies model has been summarized as being concerned with \"three Ps and a W\", or possible, probable, and preferable futures, plus [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wildcards]], which are low probability but high impact events (positive or negative). Many futurists, however, do not use the wild card approach. Rather, they use a methodology called [[Emerging Issues Analysis]]. It searches for the drivers of change, issues that are likely to move from unknown to the known, from low impact to high impact.\n\nIn terms of technique, futures practitioners originally concentrated on [[Extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], [[economic]] or [[social]] [[Fads and trends|trends]], or on attempting to [[Prediction|predict]] future trends. Over time, the discipline has come to put more and more focus on the examination of social [[system]]s and [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]], to the end of articulating [[Scenario planning|scenarios]]. The practice of scenario development facilitates the examination of worldviews and assumptions through the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others), the creation of preferred visions of the future, and the use of exercises such as [[backcasting]] to connect the present with alternative futures. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research (see below).\n\nThe general practice of futures studies also sometimes includes the articulation of normative or preferred futures, and a major thread of practice involves connecting both extrapolated (exploratory) and normative research to assist individuals and organizations to model preferred futures amid shifting social changes. Practitioners use varying proportions of collaboration, creativity and research to derive and define alternative futures, and to the degree that a \u201cpreferred\u201d future might be sought, especially in an organizational context, techniques may also be deployed to develop plans or strategies for directed future shaping or implementation of a preferred future.\n\nWhile some futurists are not concerned with assigning probability to future scenarios, other futurists find probabilities useful in certain situations, such as when probabilities stimulate thinking about scenarios within organizations [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2870/f9cef0b618c480312802fbb78e49bd69fa83.pdf <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]. When dealing with the three Ps and a W model, estimates of probability are involved with two of the four central concerns (discerning and classifying both probable and wildcard events), while considering the range of possible futures, recognizing the plurality of existing alternative futures, characterizing and attempting to resolve normative disagreements on the future, and envisioning and creating preferred futures are other major areas of scholarship. Most estimates of probability in futures studies are normative and qualitative, though significant progress on statistical and quantitative methods (technology and information growth curves, cliometrics, predictive psychology, [[prediction market]]s, crowd-voting forecasts,<sup>[31][''[[Wikipedia:NOTRS|better source needed]]'']</sup> etc.) has been made in recent decades.\n\n=== Futures techniques ===\n{{Main|Futures techniques}}\n\nFutures techniques or methodologies may be viewed as \u201cframeworks for making sense of data generated by structured processes to think about the future\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/768c/525942ae89e6364569875090b87b449abeb2.pdf|title=An Overview of Foresight Methodologies|last=Conway|first=Maree|date=|website=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref> There is no single set of methods that are appropriate for all futures research. Different futures researchers intentionally or unintentionally promote use of favored techniques over a more structured approach.

To some extent, people can determine what they consider probable or desirable using qualitative and quantitative methods. By looking at a variety of possibilities one comes closer to shaping the future, rather than merely predicting it. Shaping alternative futures starts by establishing a number of scenarios. Setting up scenarios takes place as a process with many stages. One of those stages involves the study of trends. A trend persists long-term and long-range; it affects many societal groups, grows slowly and appears to have a profound basis. In contrast, a fad operates in the short term, shows the vagaries of [[fashion]], affects particular societal groups, and spreads quickly but superficially.\n\nSample predicted futures range from predicted [[ecological catastrophe]]s, through a [[utopia]]n future where the poorest human being lives in what present-day observers would regard as wealth and comfort, through the transformation of humanity into a [[posthumanism|posthuman]] life-form, to the destruction of all life on Earth in, say, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] [[Grey Goo|disaster]].\n\nFuturists have a decidedly mixed reputation and a patchy track record at successful prediction. For reasons of convenience, they often extrapolate present technical and societal trends and assume they will develop at the same rate into the future; but technical progress and social upheavals, in reality, take place in fits and starts and in different areas at different rates.\n\nMany 1950s futurists predicted commonplace [[space tourism]] by the year 2000, but ignored the possibilities of ubiquitous, cheap [[computer]]s. On the other hand, many forecasts have portrayed the future with some degree of accuracy. Current futurists often present multiple [[scenario]]s that help their audience envision what \"may\" occur instead of merely \"predicting the future\". They claim that understanding potential scenarios helps individuals and organizations prepare with flexibility.\n\nMany corporations use futurists as part of their [[risk management]] strategy, for [[horizon scanning]] and emerging issues analysis, and to identify [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wild card]]s &ndash; low probability, potentially high-impact risks.<ref>A [http://www.globalchange.com/ppt4/risk/ sample presentation on risk management]</ref> Every successful and unsuccessful [[business]] engages in futuring to some degree &ndash; for example in research and development, innovation and market research, anticipating competitor behavior and so on.<ref name=\"rohrbeck-2010\">Rohrbeck, Rene (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm'', Springer Series: Contributions to Management Science, Heidelberg and New York, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2625-8}}</ref><ref name=\"rohrbeck-gemuenden-2010\">Rohrbeck, R.

There is some confusion about the definition of weak signal by various researchers and consultants. Sometimes it is referred as future oriented information, sometimes more like emerging issues. The confusion has been partly clarified with the concept 'the future sign', by separating signal, issue and interpretation of the future sign.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V65-4PJM9RS-2&_user=10&_coverDate=09%2F01%2F2007&_rdoc=29&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235805%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=5805&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=46&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=96d64e0a3f418f2a3fafc73da9c8f774 article about the Future sign]{{dead link|date=March 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nA weak signal can be an early indicator of coming change, and an example might also help clarify the confusion. On May 27, 2012, hundreds of people gathered for a \u201cTake the Flour Back\u201d demonstration at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK, to oppose a publicly funded trial of genetically modified wheat. This was a weak signal for a broader shift in consumer sentiment against genetically modified foods. When Whole Foods mandated the labeling of GMOs in 2013, this non-GMO idea had already become a trend and was about to be a topic of mainstream awareness.\n\n\"Wild cards\" refer to low-probability and high-impact events \"that happen quickly\" and \"have huge sweeping consequences,\" and materialize too quickly for social systems to effectively respond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hiltunen|first=Elina|date=November 2006|title=Was it Wild Card or Just Our Blindness to Gradual Change?|url=|journal=Journal of Futures Studies|volume=11(2)|pages=61\u201374|via=}}</ref>  Oliver Markley proposed four types of wild cards:<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Markley|first=Oliver|date=2011|title=A new methodology for anticipating STEEP surprises|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting & Social Change|volume=78(2011)|pages=1079\u20131097|via=}}</ref>\n\n* Type I Wild Card: low probability, high impact, high credibility\n* Type II Wild Card: high probability, high impact, low credibility\n* Type III Wild Card: high probability, high impact, disputed credibility\n* Type IV Wild Card: high probability, high impact, high credibility\n\nHe posits that it is important to track the emergence of \"Type II Wild Cards\" that have a high probability of occurring, but low credibility that it will happen.  This focus is especially important to note because it is often difficult to persuade people to accept something they don't believe is happening, until they see the wild card.  An example is climate change.  This hypothesis has gone from Type I (high impact and high credibility, but low probability where science was accepted and thought unlikely to happen) to Type II (high probability, high impact, but low credibility as policy makers and lobbyists push back against the science), to Type III (high probability, high impact, high credibility)--at least for most people,  There are still some who probably will not accept the science until the Greenland ice sheet has completely melted and sea-level has risen the seven meters estimated rise.\n\nThis concept may be embedded in standard foresight projects and introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of social groups adapt to surprises arising in turbulent business environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which relevant foresight information might be inferred. Sometimes, mistakenly, wild cards and weak signals are considered as synonyms, which they are not.<ref>[http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/11-2/4wildcard-hiltunen.pdf differences of weak signals and wild cards]</ref> One of the most often cited examples of a wild card event in recent history is 9/11. Nothing had happened in the past that could point to such a possibility and yet it had a huge impact on everyday life in the United States, from simple tasks like how to travel via airplane to deeper cultural values. Wild card events might also be natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which can force the relocation of huge populations and wipe out entire crops or completely disrupt the supply chain of many businesses. Although wild card events can't be predicted, after they occur it is often easy to reflect back and convincingly explain why they happened.\n\n===Near-term predictions===\nA long-running tradition in various [[culture]]s, and especially in the [[Mass media|media]], involves various spokespersons making predictions for the upcoming year at the beginning of the year. These [[prediction]]s sometimes base themselves on current trends in culture (music, movies, fashion, politics); sometimes they make hopeful guesses as to what major events might take place over the course of the next year.\n\nSome of these predictions come true as the year unfolds, though many fail. When predicted events fail to take place, the authors of the [[prediction]]s often state that misinterpretation of the \"[[sign (semiotics)|signs]]\" and [[Portent (divination)|portent]]s may explain the failure of the prediction.\n\n[[Marketing|Marketer]]s have increasingly started to embrace futures studies, in an effort to benefit from an increasingly competitive marketplace with fast production cycles, using such techniques as [[trend analysis|trendspotting]] as popularized by [[Faith Popcorn]].{{Dubious|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Trend analysis and forecasting ===\n\n==== Mega-trends ====\nTrends come in different sizes. A mega-trend extends over many generations, and in cases of climate, mega-trends can cover periods prior to human existence. They describe complex interactions between many factors. The increase in population from the [[palaeolithic]] period to the present provides an example. Mega-trends are likely to produce greater change than any previous one, because technology is causing trends to unfold at an accelerating pace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=Leslie P.|date=Dec 27, 2019|title=The 2020s Will Bring Massive Change.

For example, a well-documented movement toward equality between men and women might represent a branch trend. The trend toward reducing differences in the salaries of men and women in the [[Western world]] could form a twig on that branch.\n\n==== Life-cycle of a trend ====\nUnderstanding the technology adoption cycle helps futurists monitor trend development. Trends start as weak signals by small mentions in fringe media outlets, discussion conversations or blog posts, often by innovators. As these ideas, projects, beliefs or technologies gain acceptance, they move into the phase of early adopters.  \nIn the beginning of a trend's development, it is difficult to tell if it will become a significant trend that creates changes or merely a trendy fad that fades into forgotten history.  Trends will emerge as initially unconnected dots but eventually coalesce into persistent change.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Amy |title=The Signals Are Talking |date=2016 |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |isbn=9781610396660 |pages=47\u201350 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nSome trends emerge when enough confirmation occurs in the various media, surveys or questionnaires to show that it has an increasingly accepted value, behavior or technology, it becomes accepted as a bona fide trend. Trends can also gain confirmation by the existence of other trends perceived as springing from the same branch. Some commentators claim that when 15% to 25% of a given population integrates an innovation, project, belief or action into their daily life then a trend becomes mainstream.\n\n[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|[[Hype cycle|General Hype Cycle]] used to visualize [[Technology adoption life cycle|technological life stages]] of maturity, adoption, and social application.]]\n\n==== Life cycle of technologies ====\n\n[[Gartner]] created their [[Hype cycle|Hype Cycle]] to illustrate the phases a technology moves through as it grows from research and development to mainstream adoption.

Beginning in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, it has since developed in many different countries. Futures education encourages the use of concepts, tools and processes that allow students to think long-term, consequentially, and imaginatively. It generally helps students to:\n# conceptualize more just and sustainable human and planetary futures.\n# develop knowledge and skills of methods and tools used to help people understand, map, and influence the future by exploring probable and preferred futures.\n# understand the dynamics and influence that human, social and ecological systems have on alternative futures.\n# conscientize [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and action on the part of students toward creating better futures.\nThorough documentation of the history of futures education exists, for example in the work of [[Richard A. Slaughter]] (2004),<ref name=\"Slaughter 2004\">{{cite book| last=Slaughter| first= Richard A.| year=2004| title=Futures Beyond Dystopia: Creating Social Foresight| publisher=RoutledgeFalmer| location=London}}</ref> David Hicks, Ivana Milojevi\u0107<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |title=Articles by Ivana Milojevic; Futures Studies at Metafuture.org |work=metafuture.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114063552/http://www.metafuture.org/articlesbyivana.htm |archivedate=2009-11-14 }}</ref> to name a few.\n\nWhile futures studies remains a relatively new academic tradition, numerous tertiary institutions around the world teach it. These vary from small programs, or universities with just one or two classes, to programs that offer certificates and incorporate futures studies into other degrees, (for example in [[planning]], business, environmental studies, [[economics]], development studies, [[science]] and technology studies). Various formal Masters-level programs exist on six continents. Finally, doctoral dissertations around the world have incorporated futures studies (see e.g. Rohrbeck, 2010;<ref>Rohrbeck, R.

Several government agencies publish material for internal stakeholders as well as make that material available to broader public. Examples of this include the US Congressional Budget Office long term budget projections,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45308|title=Long-Term Budget Projections|work=Congressional Budget Office}}</ref> the National Intelligence Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|title=National Intelligence Council|author=Super User|work=dni.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301030845/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/organization/national-intelligence-council-global-trends|archivedate=2015-03-01}}</ref> and the United Kingdom Government Office for Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/foresight-projects|title=Foresight projects|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref> Much of this material is used by policy makers to inform policy decisions and government agencies to develop long-term plan. Several corporations, particularly those with long product development lifecycles, utilize foresight and future studies products and practitioners in the development of their business strategies. The Shell Corporation is one such entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |title=Shell Scenarios |work=shell.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307044027/http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.html |archivedate=2015-03-07 }}</ref> Foresight professionals and their tools are increasingly being used in both the private and public areas to help leaders deal with an increasingly complex and interconnected world.\n\n===Design===\nDesign and futures studies have many synergies as interdisciplinary fields with a natural orientation towards the future. Both incorporate studies of human behavior, global trends,  strategic insights, and anticipatory solutions.\n\nDesigners have adopted futures methodologies including scenarios, trend forecasting, and futures research. Design thinking and specific techniques including ethnography, rapid prototyping, and critical design have been incorporated into in futures as well. In addition to borrowing techniques from one another, futurists and designers have joined to form agencies marrying both competencies to positive effect. The continued interrelation of the two fields is an encouraging trend that has spawned much interesting work.\n\nThe Association for Professional Futurists has also held meetings discussing the ways in which Design Thinking and Futures Thinking intersect and benefit one another.\n\n===Imperial cycles and world order===\n\nImperial cycles represent an \"expanding pulsation\" of \"mathematically describable\" macro-historic trend.<ref>Hornell Hart, \"The Logistic Growth of Political Areas,\" ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-7; [[Raoul Naroll]], \"Imperial Cycles and World Order,\" ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 100-101.</ref> The [[List of largest empires]] contains imperial record progression in terms of territory or percentage of world population under single imperial rule.\n\nChinese philosopher [[K'ang Yu-wei]] and French demographer [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] in the late 19th century were the first to stress that the trend cannot proceed indefinitely on the definite surface of the globe. The trend is bound to culminate in a world empire. K'ang Yu-wei estimated that the matter will be decided in the contest between Washington and Berlin; Vacher de Lapouge foresaw this contest between the United States and Russia and estimated the chance of the United States higher.<ref>[[K'ang Yu-wei]], ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958), pp 79-80, 85; George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], ''L'Aryen: Son R\u00f4le Social'', (Nantes: 1899), chapter \" L`Avenir des Aryens.\"</ref> Both published their futures studies before [[H. G. Wells]] introduced the science of future in his ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1901).\n\nFour later anthropologists\u2014Hornell Hart, [[Raoul Naroll]], Louis Morano, and [[Robert Carneiro]]\u2014researched the expanding imperial cycles. They reached the same conclusion that a world empire is not only pre-determined but close at hand and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance.<ref>Hornell, Hart, \"The Logistic Growth of Political Areas,\" ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-408;  \nRaoul, Naroll, \"Imperial Cycles and World Order,\" ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 83-101;\nLouis A., Marano, \"A Macrohistoric Trend Towards World Government\", ''Behavior Science Notes'', 8, (1973): 35-40;\nRobert Carneiro, \"Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion\", ''Studying War: Anthropological Perspective'', eds.

An additional step would be identifying actions to avoid or minimize these risks.\n\nOne classic example of such work was how foresight work at the Royal Dutch Shell international oil company led to envision the turbulent oil prices of the 1970s as a possibility and better embed this into company planning. Yet the practice at Shell focuses on stretching the company's thinking rather than in making predictions. Its planning is meant to link and embed scenarios in \u201corganizational processes such as strategy making, innovation, risk management, public affairs, and leadership development.\u201d<ref>{{cite article|last1=Kupers|first1=Roland|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Angela|title=Living in the Futures|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/living-in-the-futures|publisher=Harvard Business Review|edition=May 2013}}</ref>\n\nForesight studies can also consider the possibility of \u201cwild card\u201d events \u2013 or events that many consider would be impossible to envision \u2013 although often such events can be imagined as remote possibilities as part of foresight work.

A foresight project begins with a question that ponders the future of any given subject area, including technology, medicine, government and business. Futurists engage in environmental scanning to search for drivers of change and emerging trends that may have an effect on the focus topic. The scanning process includes reviewing social media platforms, researching already prepared reports, engaging in Delphi studies, reading articles and any other sources of relevant information and preparing and analyzing data extrapolations. Then, through one of a number of highly structured methods<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hines |first1=Andy |title=Framework foresight for exploring emerging student needs |journal=On the Horizon |date=14 August 2017 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=145\u2013156 |doi=10.1108/OTH-03-2017-0013}}</ref> futurists organize this information and use it to create multiple future scenarios for the topic, also known as a domain. The value of preparing many different versions of the future rather than a singular prediction is that they provide a client with the ability to prepare long-range plans that will weather and optimize a variety of contexts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sarpong |first1=David |last2=Amst |first2=Martin Nils |last3=Gaspar |first3=Tam\u00e1s |title=Strategia Sapiens \u2013 strategic foresight in a new perspective |journal=Foresight |date=14 September 2015 |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=405\u2013426 |doi=10.1108/FS-03-2015-0017}}</ref>\n\n===Notable futurists===\n* [[Daniel Bell]]\n* [[Wendell Bell]]\n* [[Peter C.

Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.''\n|-\n|20\n|''Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity.'' \n|-\n|21\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.
