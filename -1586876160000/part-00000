Drummer Michael Miley had previously worked with Jay (as well as having been in [[Veruca Salt]] and the [[Carson Daly]] TV show band) and he had met bassist Robin Everhart playing at a benefit concert at [[Isaac Hayes]] house for [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[Long Beach]]. The union of these four, Holiday, Buchanan, Everhart and Miley led to the formation of Rival Sons. \n\nAs a singer-songwriter [[Jay Buchanan]] was sceptical about joining a rock and roll band but after seeing the reception to the band's debut album ''Before the Fire'' (2009) produced by [[Dave Cobb]] Jay committed to Rival Sons full-time.

Speaking about the sophomore album that was written and recorded in 20 days, with producer [[Dave Cobb]], guitarist [[Scott Holiday]] states \"This is just the simplest way to not cheat ourselves or the listener, ROCK AND ROLL can't be over-thought, and if it is, it loses its immediacy and instinct...it needs to be a knife FIGHT, not a knife DANCE.\" <ref>https://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/rival-sons-reveal-new-album-details/title=Rival Sons Reveal New Album Details</ref>\n\nRival Sons have released seven records in ten years, recording regularly to deliver the immediacy needed for rock'n'roll. \"Opting to keep the sound intact and very accurate as to deliver to the listener exactly what was happening in the room when we put it down\" - [[Scott Holiday]] talking about the album ''Great Western Valkyrie''. <ref>https://loudwire.com/rival-sons-new-album-great-western-valkyre-june-release/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/in-the-studio-rival-sons-638213</ref>\n\nThe band has a long standing, friendly and professional relationship with Grammy award winning music producer [[Dave Cobb]].

He is interested in simplicity in the recording and with the sound and vitality of real musicians in a room. <ref>https://www.soundonsound.com/people/dave-cobb</ref> Dave encourages and captures the vocal punch of the band's mainman, Jay Buchanan. \"He's unbelievable, a one-take guy \u2014 done. It's such a pleasure, because then you can get wild with things. You can experiment when it doesn't take long for the singer to do his thing.\" <ref>https://www.soundonsound.com/people/dave-cobb</ref>\n\nRival Sons recording process changed for their major label debut ''Feral Roots'', for the first time writing and recording over a process of months. Jay Buchanan stated that \"You need to shift and constantly find new soil\" within the creative process, taking eight months to write and record the Grammy nominated album instead of all their previous work which took less than six weeks. <ref>https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rival-sons-vocalist-says-bands-writing-process-is-just-like-farming-you-need-to-shift-and-constantly-find-new-soil/</ref>\n\n===Style and influences===\n\nRival Sons are often compared to sounds of the 1970's yet they cite [[Prince]], [[D\u2019Angelo]] and [[The Roots]] as influences alongside [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin\u2019 Wolf]].<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rival-sons-interview-how-the-blues-rockers-have-forged-their-own-path-to-fame-10123483.html</ref> Jay has listed artists from [[Joni Mitchell]] to [[Sly and the Family Stone]] amongst his influences, often stating [[Van Morrison]] as one of his heroes. \"I can\u2019t overstate his influence on me as a writer and vocalist\" - Louder Sound. <ref>https://www.loudersound.com/features/jay-buchanan-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life</ref>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a modern sound,\u201d insists Holiday, \u201cbecause it\u2019s being made right now\u201d.\n\nThe band are often cited for the sartorial style as well as their musical style, with Scott Holiday known for working with tailor ''Ray Brown'' and the band often wearing boots by UK bootmaker Jeffery West.

Prior to the formation of Rival Sons, [[Jay Buchanan]] recorded as a solo artist and with his ''Buchanan band''. He independently released ''All Understood'' in 2004 and ''True Love EP'' in 2006. Rival Sons formed from the remnants of guitarist [[Scott Holiday]]'s previous band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rival-sons-mn0002672136|title=Artist Rival Sons|publisher=Allmusic|date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref> He had previously been active in a number of bands including [[Human Lab]] who were signed to [[Atlantic Records]] which he then subsequently left and formed Black Summer Crush.\n\nIn 2006 Holiday came across Buchanan while searching on [[MySpace]] for a singer. Drummer Michael Miley had previously worked with Jay (as well as having been in [[Veruca Salt]] and the [[Carson Daly]] TV show band) and he had met bassist Robin Everhart playing at a benefit concert at [[Isaac Hayes]] house for [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[Long Beach]]. The union of these four, Holiday, Buchanan, Everhart and Miley led to the formation of Rival Sons. \n\nAs a singer-songwriter [[Jay Buchanan]] was sceptical about joining a rock and roll band but after seeing the reception to the band's debut album ''Before the Fire'' (2009) produced by [[Dave Cobb]] Jay committed to Rival Sons full-time.

It's such a pleasure, because then you can get wild with things. You can experiment when it doesn't take long for the singer to do his thing.\" <ref>https://www.soundonsound.com/people/dave-cobb</ref>\n\nRival Sons recording process changed for their major label debut ''Feral Roots'', for the first time writing and recording over a process of months.
