[[John Cunliffe (author)|John Cunliffe]] wrote the original treatment and scripts, and it was directed by animator [[Ivor Wood]], who also worked on ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'', [[Paddington (1975 TV series)|Paddington]], and ''[[The Herbs]]''. Following the success of the first season, and that of several TV specials in between, a second season of 13 episodes was produced by the same crew in 1996. Here, Pat had a family for the first time.

[[John Cunliffe (author)|John Cunliffe]] wrote the original treatment and scripts, and it was directed by animator [[Ivor Wood]], who also worked on ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'', [[Paddington (1975 TV series)|Paddington]], and ''[[The Herbs]]''. Following the success of the first season, and that of several TV specials in between, a second season of 13 episodes was produced by the same crew in 1996. Here, Pat had a family for the first time. A new version of the series has been produced by [[Cosgrove Hall]] from September 2004, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.  For the first time in the programme's history, ''Postman Pat'' was no longer sponsored by the [[Royal Mail]], which previously had used the show as a marketing vehicle for them. This link was dropped in November 2000, with the Royal Mail spokesman saying the character no longer fitted in with the company's \"corporate image.\" <ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1031114.stm \"Postman Pat gets the Sack\"], 19 Nov 2000.</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\nThe episode number follows the first broadcast order.\n\n===1981 TV Series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! width=\"8%\" | Episode #\n! width=\"8%\" | Series #\n! width=\"23%\" | Episode Title\n! width=\"18%\" | Original airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Postman Pat's Finding Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|16|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat calls to the Post Office and today most of the post is for Katy and Tom because it is their birthday.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Postman Pat and the Magpie Hen\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|23|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat stops for a picnic lunch near Thompson Ground halfway through his round and a hen steals his sandwich and keys.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Postman Pat's Secret Birthday\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|30|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat always thought he had managed to keep the date of his birthday to himself.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Pat's Rainy Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|10|07|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=It was a heavy rainy day in Greendale.

The city takes its name from [[Saint George]], the patron of the local church. Historically it was also known in [[German language|German]] as ''Sankt Georgen''. The \"sepsi\" prefix (''sebesi'' \u2192 ''sepsi'', meaning \"of Sebes\") refers to the area which the ancestors of the local Sz\u00e9kely population had inhabited before settling to the area of the town. The previous area of their settlement was around the town of \"Sebes\" (now: [[Sebe\u0219]]) which later became populated mainly by [[Transylvanian Saxons]].\n\nWhile part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the city was the economic and administrative center of the Hungarian county of [[H\u00e1romsz\u00e9k]], which spanned the present-day [[Covasna County|Covasna]] County and parts of [[Bra\u0219ov County|Bra\u0219ov]] County. In the second half of the 19th century, Sepsiszentgy\u00f6rgy witnessed the development of light industry, namely a textile and a cigarette factory was built.

The city takes its name from [[Saint George]], the patron of the local church. Historically it was also known in [[German language|German]] as ''Sankt Georgen''. The \"sepsi\" prefix (''sebesi'' \u2192 ''sepsi'', meaning \"of Sebes\") refers to the area which the ancestors of the local Sz\u00e9kely population had inhabited before settling to the area of the town. The previous area of their settlement was around the town of \"Sebes\" (now: [[Sebe\u0219]]) which later became populated mainly by [[Transylvanian Saxons]].\n\nWhile part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the city was the economic and administrative center of the Hungarian county of [[H\u00e1romsz\u00e9k]], which spanned the present-day [[Covasna County|Covasna]] County and parts of [[Bra\u0219ov County|Bra\u0219ov]] County. In the second half of the 19th century, Sepsiszentgy\u00f6rgy witnessed the development of light industry, namely a textile and a cigarette factory was built. It became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] following the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, after the end of World War I. After the [[Second Vienna Award]] in 1940 the city came under Hungarian control for four years. Near the end of that period, the [[Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe ghetto]] briefly existed in the city. At the end of the Second World War the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] reaffirmed the city and the entirety of Transylvania as a Romanian territory. Between 1952-1960 it was the southernmost town of the [[Magyar Autonomous Region]], and between 1960-1968 was part of the [[Regiunea Bra\u0219ov|Bra\u0219ov]] Region, abolished in 1968 when Romania was reorganised based on counties rather than regions.\n\nSf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe is one of the centres for the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] people in the region known to them as [[Sz\u00e9kely Land|Sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld]] in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] - which means \"Sz\u00e9kely Land\", and is home to the Sz\u00e9kely National Museum. The city hosts two market fairs each year.\n\n==Sights==\n* Fortified Church - constructed in the 14th century in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style\n* State Archive, the former headquarters of the [[Hussar]] battalions\n* County library constructed in 1832 as the seat of the county council\n* Theater used from 1854\u20131866 as the city hall\n* The market [[bazaar]] built in 1868, with a [[clock tower]] built in 1893\n*[https://www.sznm.ro/index_en.php Sz\u00e9kely National Museum], founded 1875\n\n==Economy==\nThe predominant industry in the city is the [[textile]] industry.

The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[Enthronement|accession]] to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[consul (representative)|consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a ''[[casus belli]]'' and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\n\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruiser]]s, two [[gunboat]]s, 150 [[Royal Marines|marines]] and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army (who was also the [[First Minister]] of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and [[machine gun]]s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HHS|Glasgow}} and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.\n\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to [[German East Africa]] (in the mainland part of present [[Tanzania]]). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]. The war marked the end of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar Sultanate]] as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.png|thumb|250px|The islands of Zanzibar and the [[Africa|African mainland]]]]\n\nZanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[Tanganyika]]; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]]. The main island, [[Unguja]] (or Zanzibar Island), had been under the nominal control of the [[Sultan of Oman|Sultans of Oman]] since 1698 when they expelled the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers who had claimed it in 1499.<ref name=\"hernon397\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=397}}.</ref> Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]] declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by Great Britain, and split the sultanate from that of Oman.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]], the second sultan and Khalid's father, had been forced by British ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish the slave trade in June 1873, though it was later discovered that instructions from London would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected.<ref>Christopher Lloyd, ''The Navy and the Slave Trade: The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century'', 1968, pp 264-268</ref>\n\nThe subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at [[Zanzibar Town]] where a palace complex was built on the sea front. By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached [[harem]]; and the [[Beit al-Ajaib]] or \"House of Wonders\"\u2014a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}.</ref> The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.<ref name=\"hernon402\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=402}}.</ref> All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.<ref name=\"hoyle160\">{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|p=160}}.</ref>\n\nBritain had recognised Zanzibar's [[sovereignty]] and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=131\u2013132}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> However, [[Germany]] was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=124\u2013131}}.</ref> Sultan [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifah]] had granted rights to the land of [[Kenya]] to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> Many of the [[Arab]] ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which [[Abushiri Revolt|resulted in some unrest]].<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the [[flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate]], which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.<ref name=\"hernon398\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=398}}.</ref> One such conflict in [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/>\n\nSultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General [[Lloyd Mathews]], a former [[Lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to restore order in Tanganyika.<ref name=\"Hernon147\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=147}}.</ref> The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/> Further conflicts erupted at [[Bagamoyo]], where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at [[Ketwa]], where German officials and their servants were murdered.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] ascended to the sultanate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=165}}.</ref> Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as [[First Minister]] to lead his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[Enthronement|accession]] to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[consul (representative)|consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a ''[[casus belli]]'' and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\n\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruiser]]s, two [[gunboat]]s, 150 [[Royal Marines|marines]] and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army (who was also the [[First Minister]] of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and [[machine gun]]s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HHS|Glasgow}} and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.\n\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to [[German East Africa]] (in the mainland part of present [[Tanzania]]). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]. The war marked the end of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar Sultanate]] as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.png|thumb|250px|The islands of Zanzibar and the [[Africa|African mainland]]]]\n\nZanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[Tanganyika]]; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]].

By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached [[harem]]; and the [[Beit al-Ajaib]] or \"House of Wonders\"\u2014a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}.</ref> The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.<ref name=\"hernon402\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=402}}.</ref> All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.<ref name=\"hoyle160\">{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|p=160}}.</ref>\n\nBritain had recognised Zanzibar's [[sovereignty]] and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=131\u2013132}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> However, [[Germany]] was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=124\u2013131}}.</ref> Sultan [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifah]] had granted rights to the land of [[Kenya]] to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> Many of the [[Arab]] ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which [[Abushiri Revolt|resulted in some unrest]].<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the [[flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate]], which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.<ref name=\"hernon398\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=398}}.</ref> One such conflict in [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/>\n\nSultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General [[Lloyd Mathews]], a former [[Lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to restore order in Tanganyika.<ref name=\"Hernon147\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=147}}.</ref> The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/> Further conflicts erupted at [[Bagamoyo]], where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at [[Ketwa]], where German officials and their servants were murdered.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] ascended to the sultanate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=165}}.</ref> Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as [[First Minister]] to lead his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

During the afternoon, all merchant vessels were cleared from the harbour and the British women and children removed to ''St George'' and a [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] vessel for their safety.

The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with ''St George'' indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, ''Thrush'' at 09:40, ''Racoon'' at 09:41, and ''Philomel'' and ''Sparrow'' at 09:45.<ref>{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|pp=20\u201326}}.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{citation|last=Bakari|first=Mohammed Ali |title= The Democratisation Process in Zanzibar: A Retarded Transition |year=2001 |publisher= [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|Institut f\u00fcr Afrika-Kunde]] |location= Hamburg |isbn= 978-3-928049-71-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9yCSamtUeiAC }}.\n* {{citation|last=Bennett|first=Norman Robert |title= A History of the Arab State of Zanzibar |publisher= [[Methuen Publishing]] |location= London |year=1978|isbn= 978-0-416-55080-1 }}.\n* {{Citation|last= Cohen |first= John |last2= Jacopetti |first2= Gualtiero |last3= Prosperi |first3= Franco |title= Africa Addio |location= New York |publisher= [[Ballantine Books]] |year= 1966 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=vR9BAAAAIAAJ |oclc= 230433}}.\n* {{citation|last= Frankl |first= P.J.L. |title= The Exile of Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash Al-BuSa'idi |journal= British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |year= 2006 |volume= 33 |issue= 2 |pages= 161\u2013177 |issn= 1469-3542 |doi= 10.1080/13530190600603675}}.\n* {{citation|last=Gordon|first=Philip H. |title= Winning the Right War: The Path to Security for America and the World |publisher= Times Books |year= 2007 |location= New York |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YUm142jq6F8C|isbn= 978-0-8050-8657-7 }}.\n* {{Citation|last= Haws|first= Duncan |last2= Hurst |first2= Alexander Anthony |title= The Maritime History of the World: A Chronological Survey of Maritime Events from 5,000 B.C. until the Present Day |location= Brighton, Sussex |publisher= Teredo Books |year= 1985 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4iFUAAAAMAAJ |isbn= 978-0-903662-10-9 }}.\n* {{citation|last=Hernon |first= Ian |title= Britain's Forgotten Wars: Colonial Campaigns of the 19th Century |publisher= [[Sutton Publishing]] |year= 2003 |location= Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn= 978-0-7509-3162-5 }}.\n* {{citation|last= Hernon |first= Ian |title= The Savage Empire: Forgotten Wars of the 19th Century |publisher=[[Sutton Publishing]] |year= 2000 |location= Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn= 978-0-7509-2480-1 }}.\n* {{citation|last=Hoyle|first=Brian |title=Urban Waterfront Revitalization in Developing Countries: The Example of Zanzibar's Stone Town |journal= Geographical Journal |year= 2002 |volume= 168 |issue= 2 |pages= 141\u2013162 |doi=10.1111/1475-4959.00044}}.\n* {{citation|last= Ingrams |first= William H. |title= Zanzibar: Its History and Its People |publisher= Cass |location= London |year= 1967 |oclc= 722777 }}.\n* {{citation|last= Lyne |first= Robert Nunez |title= Zanzibar in Contemporary Times |year= 1905 |publisher= Hurst and Blackett |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Z9sLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage |oclc= 251506750 }}.\n* {{citation|last=Owens|first=Geoffrey R.|title= Exploring the Articulation of Governmentality and Sovereignty: The Chwaka Road and the Bombardment of Zanzibar, 1895\u20131896 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal= [[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]] |year= 2007 |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |pages= 1\u201355 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_colonialism_and_colonial_history/v008/8.2owens.html |issn=1532-5768|oclc=45037899|doi=10.1353/cch.2007.0036}}.\n* {{citation|last= Patience |first= Kevin |title= Zanzibar and the Shortest War in History |publisher= Kevin Patience |location= Bahrain |year= 1994 |oclc= 37843635 }}.\n* {{citation|last= Thompson |first= Cecil |title= The Sultans of Zanzibar |journal= Tanzania Notes and Records |issue= 94 |year= 1984}}.\n* {{citation|last= Tucker |first= Alfred R. |title= Eighteen Years in Uganda and East Africa |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Negro Universities Press]] |location=Westport, Connecticut |url= https://archive.org/details/eighteenyearsinu00tuck |edition= New |isbn= 978-0-8371-3280-8 }}.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation |editor1-last=Appiah |editor1-first=K.

It was one of the first 22 channels to be launched on Astro in 1996. Astro Ria offers a variety of shows including news, Indonesian drama Malaysia, movies, reality shows, sports, talk shows, cartoons, concerts, sitcoms, documentaries, cooking shows, quizzes and more.\n\nAstro Ria is a 24-hour Bahasa Malaysia television channel operating on Astro network satellite service (formerly Channel 4). Channels that have started since Astro was launched on June 1, 1996, can be followed on channel 104 (formerly channel 1 and then channel 3) and on [[Kristal-Astro]] for [[Brunei]] broadcast. Channel changes were made from October 1, 2007, after Astro introduced a 3-digit channel. The channel is under the Astro Family package with other Malay channels like [[w:ms:Astro Prima|Astro Prima]], [[Astro Oasis]] and channel Indonesian and Bahasa Malaysia, [[Astro Aruna]].\n\nIn 2003, Astro Ria launched a show based from Mexican TV series ''[[La Academia]]'', called ''[[Akademi Fantasia]]''. The contest pits 12 singers in a bid to become the winner. The show became so popular in Malaysia and Brunei that spin-off versions were made in Indonesia and Thailand. A second season was made, which enabled Brunei viewers to vote as well. In its third season, 14 contestants instead of the original 12 were competing for the competition and the winner, [[Mawi]] became an instant music celebrity. A fourth season started in May 2006.\n\nAstro Ria also hosts various prestigious annual events in the entertainment world such as the Era Awards broadcast, the Malaysian Film Festival, the Space Series Awards and also aired UMNO General Assembly live from the Putra World Trade Center (PWTC).\n\nIn May 2002, Astro Ria launched ''Bloomberg RIA News'', which was essentially the Malay language version of [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] News Malaysia. The news was aired at 10:45 pm on weekdays. Its first anchor was Amir Mahmood Razak, who eventually also presented for the English version.

It was one of the first 22 channels to be launched on Astro in 1996. Astro Ria offers a variety of shows including news, Indonesian drama Malaysia, movies, reality shows, sports, talk shows, cartoons, concerts, sitcoms, documentaries, cooking shows, quizzes and more.\n\nAstro Ria is a 24-hour Bahasa Malaysia television channel operating on Astro network satellite service (formerly Channel 4). Channels that have started since Astro was launched on June 1, 1996, can be followed on channel 104 (formerly channel 1 and then channel 3) and on [[Kristal-Astro]] for [[Brunei]] broadcast. Channel changes were made from October 1, 2007, after Astro introduced a 3-digit channel. The channel is under the Astro Family package with other Malay channels like [[w:ms:Astro Prima|Astro Prima]], [[Astro Oasis]] and channel Indonesian and Bahasa Malaysia, [[Astro Aruna]].\n\nIn 2003, Astro Ria launched a show based from Mexican TV series ''[[La Academia]]'', called ''[[Akademi Fantasia]]''. The contest pits 12 singers in a bid to become the winner. The show became so popular in Malaysia and Brunei that spin-off versions were made in Indonesia and Thailand. A second season was made, which enabled Brunei viewers to vote as well. In its third season, 14 contestants instead of the original 12 were competing for the competition and the winner, [[Mawi]] became an instant music celebrity. A fourth season started in May 2006.\n\nAstro Ria also hosts various prestigious annual events in the entertainment world such as the Era Awards broadcast, the Malaysian Film Festival, the Space Series Awards and also aired UMNO General Assembly live from the Putra World Trade Center (PWTC).\n\nIn May 2002, Astro Ria launched ''Bloomberg RIA News'', which was essentially the Malay language version of [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] News Malaysia. The news was aired at 10:45 pm on weekdays. Its first anchor was Amir Mahmood Razak, who eventually also presented for the English version. The show was produced by Amy Mahadi.\n\nBloomberg TV and Astro's co-operation was dissolved in 2004, and the news programming became known as ''Berita Astro''. ''Berita Astro'' ceased production at the end of January 2007 and later launched a new news division, in which [[Astro Awani]] was launched in September 2007.

The song was originally included on the album, ''Recorded In Rio'', released for the first time in association with [[Blitz (magazine)|Blitz Magazine]] (Portugal) in 2004. It would later be featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 film, ''Lost Jewel Of The Atlantic'', directed by Jacob Holcomb and produced by [[World Surfing Reserves]]. The song promotes world peace, containing lyrical references to former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], [[The Cold War]] and global dictators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fotosofithaka.blogspot.com/2006/12/ithaka-and-gabriel-o-pensador.html|title=Photos of Ithaka: Ithaka (Ithaka Darin Pappas) and Gabriel O Pensador|last=Sweatlodge|date=22 December 2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdfkitapciniz.com/tag/fotosbyithaka|title=#fotosbyithaka Instagram photos and videos|website=pdfkitapciniz.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Lost Jewel of the Atlantic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt10354558/|title=Lost Jewel of the Atlantic|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://asnossasraizesvol2.blogspot.com/2017_08_18_archive.html|title=Ithaka \u2014 Flowers And The Color Of Paint (1995)|last=Unknown|date=18 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nSonically, Who's The Enemy? was programmed and pre-produced in early 2003 by Ithaka on [[Reason (software)]] at his sound lab, Coffin Alley Studios in Los Angeles. He then relocated for several months to Rio de Janeiro (Gabriel o Pensador's hometown) to record his entire album, Recorded In Rio at Studio Monoaural. There in Rio, his digital demo was recreated and expanded upon with live instruments with the aid of producer Berna Ceppas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waves.com.br/arquivo/miscellaneous-man/|website=Waves}}</ref>\n\nIthaka had already invited friend Gabriel o Pensador (Portuguese for \"Gabriel the Thinker\") to participate on the track lyrically and vocally, but it hadn't been decided upon which specific song. Most of Ithaka's lyric notebook was full of a series of personal, short-story type songs and Gabriel, a superstar rapper and [[Pr\u00eamio Jabuti|Jabuti Award]]-winning author known for his intellectual, socially-oriented lyrics, longed to do something more inclusive of the current world events of that time. Gabriel then saw the rough lyrics for ''Who's The Enemy?'' in the lyric binder. They had been loosely based on an earlier song by Ithaka entitled \"Erase The Slate Of Hate\" that had featured [[Hip hop tuga]] pioneer, [[General D]] and had appeared on the 1995 album, [[Flowers And The Color Of Paint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/viverock/page/blog/gabriel-o-pensador/g0mW_ge0u6uGanq50PB0vgvLQQWrNebjb0X|title=Gabriel o Pensador! - Vive El Rock Amino|website=Vive El Rock - aminoapps.com}}</ref>\n\nWith the global political situation seeming unchanged in 2003 since ''Erase The Slate Of Hate'''s recording in 1995, Ithaka wanted to relook at this same subject matter eight years later and was planning on doing a variation of the tune on the new album. Gabriel, saw what he was looking for in the song and it was decided he would contribute both vocals and lyrics to make an entirely new song.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAt this point, the track still had Ithaka's digitally programmed Reason bass line and Gabriel invited his friend and early career producer [[Liminha]], a celebrated [[Bassist]], to improve it with a live instrument. In addition to being a former member of the Brazilian psychedelic rock group [[Os Mutantes]], Liminha, had recorded and performed with [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], [[Ed Motta]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Caetano Veloso]], etc.\nHe is the recipient of a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary World Music Album and three [[Latin Grammy Award]]s for Best [[Brazilian rock]] Album, Best [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]] Album, [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album|Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/liminha-os-mutantes/|title=Bassist and producer Liminha worked with Veloso, Gil, and Os Mutantes|date=9 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOnly after the new, smooth [[Fretless guitar|fretless bass guitar]] of Liminha was laid down on the track did Gabriel record his vocals. The song is significant in the fact that, it would mark the first (and only) song in English that the celebrated lyricist and superstar has recorded to date.<ref name=\"discogs.com\"/>\n\nJeferson \"Jefinho\" Victor (a musician with composer [[Arto Lindsay]]) was then called in to provide melodic live [[Flugelhorn]] and trumpet parts. And finally, DJ Negralha of the Brazilian reggae/rock band [[O Rappa]], added final percussive details with vinyl [[Scratching]] and [[Berimbau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/salt-mw0000331507/credits|title=Salt - Arto Lindsay - Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/10293|title=Arto Lindsay|website=Discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/O-Rappa-Ac%C3%BAstico-Oficina-Francisco-Brennand/release/9559418|title=O Rappa - Ac\u00fastico Oficina Francisco Brennand|website=Discogs}}</ref><ref name=\"discogs.com1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ithaka-Recorded-In-Rio/release/4736040|title=Ithaka - Recorded In Rio|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nThe song was initially mixed by Daniel Carvalho and Fabiano Franco at STudio Monoaural. And later in Los Angeles, additional editing, mixing and mastering were done at Faith Recording Studios by Conley Abrams III and Ithaka.<ref name=\"discogs.com\"/>\n\nThe album that Who's The Enemy? first appeared on called, ''Recorded In Rio'' was released as a purchasable supplement with [[Blitz (magazine)]] in Portugal. It was a territory where both Ithaka and Gabriel were visible artists. Ithaka had lived and recorded there between 1992-1998 and had been nominated for a total of nine [[Blitz (magazine)|Blitz Music Awards]] and other accolades. And Gabriel, being a high-profile [[Brazilian hip hop]] figure, had frequently toured Portugal since 1993, already having several charting tracks on Portuguese radio. Because of these factors, \"Who's The Enemy?\" had a moderate amount of radio airtime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://billy-news.blogspot.com/2004/09/ithaka-novo-cd-no-prximo-blitz.html|title=Billy-News: ITHAKA - Novo Cd no pr\u00f3ximo Blitz|last=Billy|publisher=|year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://paranoiasnfm.wordpress.com/tag/darin-pappas/|title=Darin Pappas - Paran\u00f3ias|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muralsonoro.com/mural-sonoro-blog|title=Mural Sonoro|website=Mural Sonoro by Soraia Sim\u00f5es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://topdisco.blogspot.com/2010/04/|title=TOP DISCO - VENDAS DE DISCOS EM PORTUGAL|website=topdisco.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref name=\"discogs.com1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://billy-news.blogspot.com/2004/09/|title=Billy-News|website=billy-news.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref name=\"discogs.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blitz.pt/listas/2016-03-24-Os-40-melhores-albuns-dos-anos-90-em-Portugal|title=BLITZ \u2013 Os 40 melhores \u00e1lbuns dos anos 90 em Portugal|website=Jornal blitz}}</ref>\n\n==Lost Jewel Of The Atlantic==\nIn 2006, Who's The Enemy? appeared in the environmental surf documentary entitled \"Lost Jewel Of The Atlantic\".

They flatly refused, stating that hip hop was 'a fad and had no real place in the magazine'. But undiscouraged, Ithaka arrived at the artist's hotel a few hours before the concert, and introducing himself as hip hop photographer was able to suggest a photo session. There, in an empty banquet room at the hotel with his entourage nearby, Ithaka photographed nineteen year old Gabriel in a wheelchair. He had broken his leg a few days before playing soccer. The unusual images of a rapper in a full leg cast in a wheelchair ended up being a fold-out poster in the same magazine that had refused to book a photo session with the artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waves.com.br/arquivo/miscellaneous-man/|title=Miscellaneous Man|first=Ricardo|last=Macario|date=25 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/ITHAKA-Gabriel-O-Pensador-Whos-The-Enemy-15th-Anniversary-Remastered-Edition/release/13651655|title=ITHAKA, Gabriel O Pensador - Who's The Enemy?

It was uncommon at the time for people associated with hip hop to also be involved with surfing. The two became friends.\n\nIt was years later while Ithaka was visiting Gabriel o Pensador and his family in Brazil, that Gabriel suggested the idea to Ithaka of recording an album there in Rio de Janeiro.

The song was originally included on the album, ''Recorded In Rio'', released for the first time in association with [[Blitz (magazine)|Blitz Magazine]] (Portugal) in 2004. It would later be featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 film, ''Lost Jewel Of The Atlantic'', directed by Jacob Holcomb and produced by [[World Surfing Reserves]]. The song promotes world peace, containing lyrical references to former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], [[The Cold War]] and global dictators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fotosofithaka.blogspot.com/2006/12/ithaka-and-gabriel-o-pensador.html|title=Photos of Ithaka: Ithaka (Ithaka Darin Pappas) and Gabriel O Pensador|last=Sweatlodge|date=22 December 2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdfkitapciniz.com/tag/fotosbyithaka|title=#fotosbyithaka Instagram photos and videos|website=pdfkitapciniz.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Lost Jewel of the Atlantic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt10354558/|title=Lost Jewel of the Atlantic|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://asnossasraizesvol2.blogspot.com/2017_08_18_archive.html|title=Ithaka \u2014 Flowers And The Color Of Paint (1995)|last=Unknown|date=18 August 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nSonically, Who's The Enemy? was programed and pre-produced in early 2003 by Ithaka on [[Reason (software)]] at his sound lab, Coffin Alley Studios in Los Angeles. He then relocated for several months to Rio de Janeiro (Gabriel o Pensador's hometown) to record his entire album, Recorded In Rio at Studio Monoaural. There in Rio, his digital demo was recreated and expanded upon with live instruments with the aid of producer Berna Ceppas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waves.com.br/arquivo/miscellaneous-man/|website=Waves}}</ref>\n\nIthaka had already invited friend Gabriel o Pensador (Portuguese for \"Gabriel the Thinker\") to participate on the track lyrically and vocally, but it hadn't been decided upon which specific song. Most of Ithaka's lyric notebook was full of a series of personal, short-story type songs and Gabriel, a superstar rapper and [[Pr\u00eamio Jabuti|Jabuti Award]]-winning author known for his intellectual, socially-oriented lyrics, longed to do something more inclusive of the current world events of that time. Gabriel then saw the rough lyrics for ''Who's The Enemy?'' in the lyric binder. They had been loosely based on an earlier song by Ithaka entitled \"Erase The Slate Of Hate\" that had featured [[Hip hop tuga]] pioneer, [[General D]] and had appeared on the 1995 album, [[Flowers And The Color Of Paint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/viverock/page/blog/gabriel-o-pensador/g0mW_ge0u6uGanq50PB0vgvLQQWrNebjb0X|title=Gabriel o Pensador! - Vive El Rock Amino|website=Vive El Rock - aminoapps.com}}</ref>\n\nWith the global political situation seeming unchanged in 2003 since ''Erase The Slate Of Hate'''s recording in 1995, Ithaka wanted to relook at this same subject matter eight years later and was planning on doing a variation of the tune on the new album. Gabriel, saw what he was looking for in the song and it was decided he would contribute both vocals and lyrics to make an entirely new song.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAt this point, the track still had Ithaka's digitally programed Reason bass line and Gabriel invited his friend and early career producer [[Liminha]], a celebrated [[Bassist]], to improve it with a live instrument. In addition to being a former member of the Brazilian psychedelic rock group [[Os Mutantes]], Liminha, had recorded and performed with [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], [[Ed Motta]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Caetano Veloso]], etc.\nHe is the recipient of a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary World Music Album and three [[Latin Grammy Award]]s for Best [[Brazilian rock]] Album, Best [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]] Album, [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album|Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/liminha-os-mutantes/|title=Bassist and producer Liminha worked with Veloso, Gil, and Os Mutantes|date=9 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOnly after the new, smooth [[Fretless guitar|fretless bass guitar]] of Liminha was laid down on the track did Gabriel record his vocals. The song is significant in the fact that, it would mark the first (and only) song in English that the celebrated lyricist and superstar has recorded to date.<ref name=\"discogs.com\"/>\n\nJeferson \"Jefinho\" Victor (a musician with composer [[Arto Lindsay]]) was then called in to provide melodic live [[Flugelhorn]] and trumpet parts. And finally, DJ Negralha of the Brazilian reggae/rock band [[O Rappa]], added final percussive details with vinyl [[Scratching]] and [[Berimbau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/salt-mw0000331507/credits|title=Salt - Arto Lindsay - Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/10293|title=Arto Lindsay|website=Discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/O-Rappa-Ac%C3%BAstico-Oficina-Francisco-Brennand/release/9559418|title=O Rappa - Ac\u00fastico Oficina Francisco Brennand|website=Discogs}}</ref><ref name=\"discogs.com1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ithaka-Recorded-In-Rio/release/4736040|title=Ithaka - Recorded In Rio|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nThe song was initially mixed by Daniel Carvalho and Fabiano Franco at STudio Monoaural. And later in Los Angeles, additional editing, mixing and mastering were done at Faith Recording Studios by Conley Abrams III and Ithaka.<ref name=\"discogs.com\"/>\n\nThe album that Who's The Enemy? first appeared on called, ''Recorded In Rio'' was released as a purchasable supplement with [[Blitz (magazine)]] in Portugal. It was a territory where both Ithaka and Gabriel were visible artists. Ithaka had lived and recorded there between 1992-1998 and had been nominated for a total of nine [[Blitz (magazine)|Blitz Music Awards]] and other accolades. And Gabriel, being a high-profile [[Brazilian hip hop]] figure, had frequently toured Portugal since 1993, already having several charting tracks on Portuguese radio. Because of these factors, \"Who's The Enemy?\" had a moderate amount of radio airtime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://billy-news.blogspot.com/2004/09/ithaka-novo-cd-no-prximo-blitz.html|title=Billy-News: ITHAKA - Novo Cd no pr\u00f3ximo Blitz|last=Billy|publisher=|year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://paranoiasnfm.wordpress.com/tag/darin-pappas/|title=Darin Pappas - Paran\u00f3ias|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muralsonoro.com/mural-sonoro-blog|title=Mural Sonoro|website=Mural Sonoro by Soraia Sim\u00f5es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://topdisco.blogspot.com/2010/04/|title=TOP DISCO - VENDAS DE DISCOS EM PORTUGAL|website=topdisco.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref name=\"discogs.com1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://billy-news.blogspot.com/2004/09/|title=Billy-News|website=billy-news.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref name=\"discogs.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blitz.pt/listas/2016-03-24-Os-40-melhores-albuns-dos-anos-90-em-Portugal|title=BLITZ \u2013 Os 40 melhores \u00e1lbuns dos anos 90 em Portugal|website=Jornal blitz}}</ref>\n\n==Lost Jewel Of The Atlantic==\nIn 2006, Who's The Enemy? appeared in the environmental surf documentary entitled \"Lost Jewel Of The Atlantic\". The project was directed and edited by Jacob Holcomb and produced by surfer/activist Will Henry for [[World Surfing Reserves]], a division of the Save The Waves (USA). It premiered at the Santa Cruz Film Festival on Monday, May 8, 2006. Unknown to the film's producers, headlines appeared in newspapers on the island of Madeira the following day, one reading \u201cMovie Documents the Fight to Save the Surf from Eager Investors and a Corrupt Government.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deluca.blogspot.com/mauroferreira/arquivo/2006_05_07_arquivo.html|title=No Est\u00e1dio com Mauro Ferreira: 05/07/2006 - 05/13/2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waves.com.br/arquivo/tesouro-ameacado/|title=Tesouro amea\u00e7ado|first=Ricardo|last=Macario|date=18 September 2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waves.com.br/arquivo/gabriel-o-pensador/|title=Gabriel O Pensador|last=Fernando Iesca|date=12 January 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe news coverage provoked angry reactions from many of Madeira's political leaders, who promised to ''judicially prosecute'' those responsible for producing the film, ''as criminals''. Manuel Santos Costas, spokesman for the Cabinet of Madeiran President [[Alberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim]], promised to take \u201cadequate steps to defend the honor and good name of the region, its population, and its President. Despite protests from the right-wing government on the island, the movie was premiered in September 2006 at the Cinemax theater in Funchal on the island. It was the most profitable film the theater had seen in several years and later showed in theaters on mainland Portugal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olhodefogo.blogspot.com/2006/10/lost-jewel-of-atlantic-um-despertar.html|title=olho de fogo: \"Lost Jewel of the Atlantic\", um despertar c\u00edvico (a civic awakening)|first=Nelio|last=Sousa|publisher=|year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.savethewaves.org/madeiras-government-threatens-lawsuit/|title=Madeira's Government Threatens Lawsuit|date=27 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vagueares.blogspot.com/2007/11/|title=Vagueares|website=vagueares.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfline.com/surf-news/lost-jewel-of-the-atlantic-makes-waves-in-madeira_4315/|title=Lost Jewel of the Atlantic Makes Waves in Madeira|website=Surfline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfline.com/surf-news/save-the-waves-documentary-goes-to-madeira-and-portugal_3899/|title=Save the Waves Documentary Goes to Madeira and Portugal|website=Surfline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/28736545|title=\"WHO'S THE ENEMY ?\" by Ithaka & Gabriel o Pensador (with lyrics)|website=Vimeo}}</ref>\n\n==Personal association==\nIthaka Darin Pappas, who had been an early photographer of U.S. west coast hip hop artists such as [[Eazy E]], [[N.W.A.]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Low Profile]], etc. for [[Priority Records]] and Quality Records, had moved to Lisbon, Portugal in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2018/10/entertainment/hip-hop-portraits-cnnphotos/|title=The stories behind hip-hop's most iconic images|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-datebook-contact-high-annenberg-story.html|title=Datebook: Roy Dowell's hypnotic plays on pattern|first=Carolina A.|last=Miranda|website=Los Angeles Times|date=25 April 2019}}</ref> There he had sporadic work with the music magazine, Super Som, published by [[Editora Abril]]. At the time, there was little or no hip hop in Portugal and Gabriel already had a big hit in Brazil with \"T\u00f4 Feliz (Matei o Presidente)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/2017/10/20/gabriel-o-pensador-comemora-a-morte-de-temer-no-rap-to-feliz-matei-o-presidente-2_a_23250289/|title=Gabriel O Pensador comemora a morte de Temer no rap 'T\u00f4 Feliz (Matei o Presidente) 2'|website=huffpostbrasil.com|date=20 October 2017}}</ref> A four-city Portugal tour had been arranged for Gabriel o Pensador, to introduce hip hop to the motherland, and when Ithaka heard about it he asked the magazine to assign him to cover the one of the concerts as a photojournalist. They flatly refused, stating that hip hop was 'a fad and had no real place in the magazine'. But undiscouraged, Ithaka arrived at the artist's hotel a few hours before the concert, and introducing himself as hip hop photographer was able to suggest a photo session. There, in an empty banquet room at the hotel with his entourage nearby, Ithaka photographed nineteen year old Gabriel in a wheelchair. He had broken his leg a few days before playing soccer. The unusual images of a rapper in a full leg cast in a wheelchair ended up being a fold-out poster in the same magazine that had refused to book a photo session with the artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waves.com.br/arquivo/miscellaneous-man/|title=Miscellaneous Man|first=Ricardo|last=Macario|date=25 October 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/ITHAKA-Gabriel-O-Pensador-Whos-The-Enemy-15th-Anniversary-Remastered-Edition/release/13651655|title=ITHAKA, Gabriel O Pensador - Who's The Enemy?

It was uncommon at the time for people associated with hip hop to also be involved with surfing. The two became friends.\n\nIt was years later while Ithaka was visiting Gabriel o Pensador and his family in Brazil, that Gabriel suggested the idea to Ithaka of recording an album there in Rio de Janeiro.
