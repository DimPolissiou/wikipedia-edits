Most of these were found on rock outcrop habitats. Ranking second was Brown County with 62 species. 48 species were found in Kewaunee County, ranking eighth. [[Deroceras|Slugs]] were found in all three counties. Peninsula State Park is home to the northernmost known population of ''Strobilops aenea''. The species ''[[Vertigo hubrichti]]'' and ''Vertigo morsei'' are endemic to the upper Midwest. These two species had the highest occurrence frequencies along the Door and Garden Peninsulas. Door County is also home to several uncommon species from the genus ''[[Oxychilus]]'', which is non-native and introduced from Europe. One was found near a vacation home and may have been introduced by landscape plantings. Within the county, Brussels Hill, North Kangaroo Lake, Rock Island and the escarpment with its cool [[algific talus slope|algific]] habitat supports populations of rare snails.<ref>[http://biology.unm.edu/jnekola/nekola%20pdf/amb-18-21-44.pdf Terrestrial gastropod fauna of Northeastern Wisconsin and the Southern Upper Peninsula of Michigan], Jeffrey C.

This was the result of an experiment to stock millions of eggs from the species ''[[Hexagenia limbata]]'' and ''[[Hexagenia bilineata]]'' in the lower Green Bay area in an attempt to reintroduce the species. The last mayfly from the genus ''[[Hexagenia]]'' had been collected in the lower Green Bay area in 1955. As mayfly populations can be unstable and not all stocking locations appeared to be successful, as of 2017 it was not yet known whether it would be possible for populations of ''Hexagenia'' mayflies to become self-sustaining.<ref>[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d03bfb936126b000179a66b/t/5d080c80e259a50001faf6b6/1560808598739/Kaster+et+al+2018+Green+Bay.pdf Evaluation of lower Green Bay benthic fauna with emphasis on re-ecesis of Hexagenia mayfly nymphs] by Jerry L.

By 1895, a large fruit tree nursery was established and fruit horticulture was aggressively promoted. Not only farmers but even \"city-bred\" men were urged to consider fruit husbandry as a career. The first of multiple fruit marketing cooperatives began in 1897. In addition to corporate-run orchards, in 1910 the first corporation was established to plant and sell pre-established orchards. Although apple orchards predated cherry orchards, by 1913 it was reported that cherries had outpaced apples.<ref name=Cain>{{cite thesis |last=Cain |first=Cortney |date=May 2006 |title=The Development of Apple Horticulture in Wisconsin, 1850s-1950s: Case Studies of Bayfield, Crawford, and Door Counties |type=M.A. thesis |chapter=Chapter 4, Door County Apple Horticulture |publisher=UW-Madison |chapter-url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005752947 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Cherry crop labor sources====\nWomen and children were typically employed to pick fruit crops, but the available work outstripped the labor supply. By 1918, it was difficult to find enough help to pick fruit crops, so workers were brought in by the YMCA and Boy Scouts of America. Cherry picking was marketed as a good summer camp activity for teenage boys in return for room, board, and recreation activities. One orchard hired players from the [[Green Bay Packers]] as camp counselors. Additionally, members of the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and other native tribes were employed to pick fruit crops.<ref>[https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/68290/Bankston%20Jarocki%20Miller.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Geography of Apple Orchards in Wisconsin: Examining the Core of Cultivation] by Kody Bankston, Morgan Jarocki, and Adrienne Miller, unpublished student paper, UW-Madison, 2012</ref><ref>[https://wi101.wisc.edu/2017/07/01/migrant-labor-and-door-county-cherries/ Migrant Labor and Door County Cherries] by Emily Irwin, July 1, 2017</ref> A [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp was established at [[Peninsula State Park]] during the [[Great Depression]].

The newest is in a relatively shallow layer of sand and gravel, but tends to not to provide enough water except in the southeastern part of the county. Further down are layers of dolomite bedrock that are recharged by water percolating from the layer of sand and gravel. Past the dolomite is a layer of shale that [[aquitard|does not contain water]], although potentially it is a source of oil. Past the shale is a layer of sandstone that is also host to a bedrock aquifer.

Most of these were found on rock outcrop habitats. Ranking second was Brown County with 62 species. 48 species were found in Kewaunee County, ranking eighth. [[Deroceras|Slugs]] were found in all three counties. Peninsula State Park is home to the northernmost known population of ''Strobilops aenea''. The species ''[[Vertigo hubrichti]]'' and ''Vertigo morsei'' are endemic to the upper Midwest. These two species had the highest occurrence frequencies along the Door and Garden Peninsulas. Door County is also home to several uncommon species from the genus ''[[Oxychilus]]'', which is non-native and introduced from Europe. One was found near a vacation home and may have been introduced by landscape plantings. Within the county, Brussels Hill, North Kangaroo Lake, Rock Island and the escarpment with its cool [[algific talus slope|algific]] habitat supports populations of rare snails.<ref>[http://biology.unm.edu/jnekola/nekola%20pdf/amb-18-21-44.pdf Terrestrial gastropod fauna of Northeastern Wisconsin and the Southern Upper Peninsula of Michigan], Jeffrey C.

The last mayfly from the genus ''[[Hexagenia]]'' had been collected in the lower Green Bay area in 1955.
