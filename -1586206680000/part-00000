Krekar became the leader of the merged Ansar al-Islam, which opposed an agreement made between IMK and the dominant Kurdish group in the area, [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK). The group later made an allegiance to al-Qaeda and allegedly received direct funds from the terror network.<ref>''Terrorism & Its Effects''. Sanchez, Juan.

The group consists of various Islamist factions that splintered from the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan (IMK). In 2001, shortly before the 9/11 attacks, leaders of several Kurdish Islamist factions visited the al-Qa'ida leadership in Afghanistan planning to create a base for al-Qa'ida in northern Iraq. A document found in Kabul stated the groups' objectives, which was to \"\"expel those Jews and Christians from Kurdistan and join the way of jihad, [and] rule every piece of land \u2026 with the Islamic Shari'a rule.\" This was also confirmed by the ''Los Angeles Times'', based upon interviews with an Ansar prisoner, which stated that in October 2000, Kurdish Islamist leaders sent jihadists to bin Laden's camps.

The attacks allowed the AAI to carve out space to impose its form of Islamist governance in northeast Iraq under its spiritual founder and leader [[Mullah Krekar]].

The group consists of various Islamist factions that splintered from the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan (IMK). In 2001, shortly before the 9/11 attacks, leaders of several Kurdish Islamist factions visited the al-Qa'ida leadership in Afghanistan planning to create a base for al-Qa'ida in northern Iraq. A document found in Kabul stated the groups' objectives, which was to \"\"expel those Jews and Christians from Kurdistan and join the way of jihad, [and] rule every piece of land \u2026 with the Islamic Shari'a rule.\" This was also confirmed by the ''Los Angeles Times'', based upon interviews with an Ansar prisoner, which stated that in October 2000, Kurdish Islamist leaders sent jihadists to bin Laden's camps.

The attacks allowed the AAI to carve out space to impose its form of Islamist governance in northeast Iraq under its spiritual founder and leader [[Mullah Krekar]].

Rabbi Lapin has likewise been recognized as the Rabbi in Haiti by the Haitian government<Tribunal de Premiere Instance de Port-au-Prince; Recipisse No. 3710084007-7; 4 Octobre 2017>.  The community is very small and mostly consists of UN, NGO, and diplomatic personnel, although there are a small number of Haitian Jewish families.  The community does Kosher chicken slaughtering (shkita) and has occasional gatherings for Jewish festivals such as Succos and Purim.  There is also an Esrog, Myrtle (Hadasim) and Willow (Aravos) plantation to supply local needs for Succos.\nThe community is working on developing a synagogue and community center.  There is a complete library of Jewish liturgical books (seforim), Megillas Esther and Sefer Torah.\n\n===Business===\nThe 1960s was a time of wealth and high hopes of large future development for Haiti.

Rabbi Lapin has likewise been recognized as the Rabbi in Haiti by the Haitian government<Tribunal de Premiere Instance de Port au Prince; Recipisse No. 3710084007-7; 4 Octobre 2017>.  The community is very small and mostly consists of UN, NGO, and diplomatic personnel, although there are a small number of Haitian Jewish families.  The community does Kosher chicken slaughtering (shkita) and has occasional gatherings for Jewish festivals such as Succos and Purim.  There is also an Esrog, Myrtle (Hadasim) and Willow (Aravos) plantation to supply local needs for Succos.\nThe community is working on developing a synagogue and community center.  There is a complete library of Jewish liturgical books (seforim), Megillas Esther and Sefer Torah.\n\n===Business===\nThe 1960s was a time of wealth and high hopes of large future development for Haiti.

Today, less than a hundred Jews remain in Haiti on its 9.5 million inhabitants; however, the Weiners (coffee exporters) and the Salzmanns (refugees from Austria) are still today relevant in trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehaitianculture.blogspot.com/2013_05_01_archive.html |title=First Jews In Haiti |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desinfos.com/spip.php?page=article&id_article=16680 |title=Ha\u00efti, les Juifs et Isra\u00ebl |editor=Yerouchalmi |date=17 January 2010 |publisher=Des Infos |accessdate=21 December 2015|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Haitian Jews==\n* David Ades \u2013 political writer for [[Le Nouvelliste (Haiti)|Le Nouvelliste]]\n* Daniel Kedar \u2013 businessman; co-founder of Prodev\n* Elisabeth Silvera \u2013 President of the Fondation Haiti Solidarite (FHS)\n* [[Eric Andr\u00e9]] \u2013 actor, comedian and television host\n* Gaston Michel \u2013 local tourism official\n* [[Gilbert Bigio]] \u2013 businessman billionaire of [[Syria]]n descent and Israeli honorary consul in Haiti\n* Kenneth Ades \u2013 financial service provider\n* [[Luis de Torres]] \u2013 one of the first Jews to settle on Haiti, and also [[Christopher Columbus]]'s interpreter\n* Monique Bigio \u2013 shareholder of [[PromoCapital]]\n* [[Monique P\u00e9an]] \u2013 fine [[jewelry designer]]\n* Reuven Bigio \u2013 founder of FAE (Fondation Appui \u00e0 l'Education)\n* Robin Padberg \u2013 CEO of telecommunications company [[Comcel Haiti|Voila]] in Haiti\n* Rudolph Dana \u2013 CEO of Transec SA\n* [[Sol (musician)|Sol]] \u2013 is a musician of [[Russia]]n descent\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Haiti}}\n* [[Haiti-Israel relations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Martinque, Guadeloupe, Haiti: M.

It lies roughly north of [[Saint-Malo]] and to the west of [[Jersey]] and the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. With several smaller nearby islands, it forms a jurisdiction within the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], a [[Crown dependencies|British Crown dependency]]. The jurisdiction is made up of [[Parishes of Guernsey|ten parishes]] on the island of Guernsey, three other inhabited islands ([[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]]), and many small islets and rocks. The jurisdiction is not part of the [[United Kingdom]], although defence and most foreign relations are handled by the British Government. The entire jurisdiction lies within the [[Common Travel Area]] of the [[British Islands]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], and although it is not a member of the [[European Union]], it does have a special relationship with it, being treated as part of the European Community with access to the single market for the purposes of the free trade in goods.

They are widely used to replace [[phosphorus]]. The 4\u00c5 molecular sieve plays a major role to replace sodium tripolyphosphate as detergent auxiliary in order to mitigate the environmental impact of the detergent.

Due to the high selectivity for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> they have been successfully applied in the field to combat [[eutrophication]] and other effects in waterways due to excessive ammonium ions. 4\u00c5 molecular sieves have also been used to remove heavy metal ions present in water due to industrial activities.\n====Other purposes====\n# The [[metallurgical industry]]: separating agent, separation, extraction of brine potassium, [[rubidium]], [[caesium]], etc. \n# Petrochemical industry, [[catalyst]], [[desiccant]], adsorbent \n# Agriculture: [[soil conditioner]]\n# Medicine: load silver [[zeolite]] antibacterial agent.\n\n==5\u00c5==\n* Chemical formula: 0.7CaO\u20220.30Na<sub>2</sub>O\u2022Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u20222.0SiO<sub>2</sub> \u20224.5H<sub>2</sub>O\n* Silica-alumina ratio: SiO<sub>2</sub>/ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u22482\n===Production===\n5A molecular sieves are produced by cation exchange of [[potassium]] for [[sodium]] in 4A molecular sieves (See above)\n===Usage===\nFive [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (5\u00c5) molecular sieves are often utilized in the [[petroleum]] industry, especially for the purification of gas streams and in the chemistry laboratory for separating [[chemical compound|compounds]] and drying reaction starting materials. They contain tiny pores of a precise and uniform size, and are mainly used as an adsorbent for gases and liquids.\n\nFive \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m molecular sieves are used to dry [[natural gas]], along with performing [[desulfurization]] and [[carbonation|decarbonation]] of the gas. They can also be used to separate mixtures of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, and oil-wax n-hydrocarbons from branched and polycyclic hydrocarbons.\n\nFive \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m molecular sieves are stored at room temperature, with a [[relative humidity]] less than 90% in cardboard barrels or carton packaging. The molecular sieves should not be directly exposed to the air and water, acids and alkalis should be avoided.\n\n== Selecting molecular sieves ==\nMolecular sieves are available in different shape and sizes. But the spherical beads have advantage over other shapes as they offer lower pressure drop, are attrition resistant as they do not have any sharp edges, and have good strength, i.e. crush force required per unit area is higher. Certain beaded molecular sieves offer lower heat capacity thus lower energy requirements during regeneration.\n\nThe other advantage of using beaded molecular sieves is bulk density is usually higher than other shape, thus for same adsorption requirement molecular sieve volume required is less. Thus while doing de-bottlenecking you may use beaded molecular sieves, load more adsorbent in same volume, and avoid any vessel modifications.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Activated carbon]]\n* [[Desiccant]]\n* [[Lime (mineral)]]\n* [[Silica gel]]\n* [[Zeolite]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Scholia|topic}}\n* [http://www.physorg.com/news65284632.html Sieves Put A Lid On Greenhouse Gas]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716041353/http://www.sepcor.com/sievesafety.htm Molecular Sieve Safety]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160617033100/http://brownell.co.uk/products/desiccants/molecular-sieves.html About Molecular Sieves]\n\n[[Category:Filters]]\n[[Category:Desiccants]]\n[[Category:Vacuum]]\n[[Category:Chemical process engineering]]\n[[Category:Industrial gases]]\n[[Category:Gas technologies]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Molecular Sieve5.jpg|thumb|A sealed canister, commonly filled with [[silica gel]] and other molecular sieves used as [[desiccant]] in drug containers to keep contents dry. |350x350px]]\n[[File:MSN vials.JPG|thumb|150px|Vials of [[mesoporous silica]]]]\nA '''molecular sieve''' is a material with [[Pore (material)|pores]] (very small holes) of uniform size.

It is widely used in the drying, refining and purification of liquids and gases (such as the preparation of argon).\n\n[[File:4A sieves.JPG|thumb|150px|Bottle of 4\u00c5 molecular sieves.]]\n====Polyester agent additives====\nThese molecular sieves are used to assist detergents as they can produce demineralized water through [[calcium]] ion exchange, remove and prevent the deposition of dirt. They are widely used to replace [[phosphorus]]. The 4\u00c5 molecular sieve plays a major role to replace sodium tripolyphosphate as detergent auxiliary in order to mitigate the environmental impact of the detergent. It also can be used as a [[soap]] forming agent and in [[toothpaste]].\n====Harmful waste treatment====\n4\u00c5 molecular sieves can purify sewage of cationic species such as [[ammonium]] ions, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Due to the high selectivity for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> they have been successfully applied in the field to combat [[eutrophication]] and other effects in waterways due to excessive ammonium ions. 4\u00c5 molecular sieves have also been used to remove heavy metal ions present in water due to industrial activities.\n====Other purposes====\n# The [[metallurgical industry]]: separating agent, separation, extraction of brine potassium, [[rubidium]], [[caesium]], etc. \n# Petrochemical industry, [[catalyst]], [[desiccant]], adsorbent \n# Agriculture: [[soil conditioner]]\n# Medicine: load silver [[zeolite]] antibacterial agent.\n\n==5\u00c5==\n* Chemical formula: 0.7CaO\u20220.30Na<sub>2</sub>O\u2022Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u20222.0SiO<sub>2</sub> \u20224.5H<sub>2</sub>O\n* Silica-alumina ratio: SiO<sub>2</sub>/ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u22482\n===Production===\n5A molecular sieves are produced by cation exchange of [[potassium]] for [[sodium]] in 4A molecular sieves (See above)\n===Usage===\nFive [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (5\u00c5) molecular sieves are often utilized in the [[petroleum]] industry, especially for the purification of gas streams and in the chemistry laboratory for separating [[chemical compound|compounds]] and drying reaction starting materials. They contain tiny pores of a precise and uniform size, and are mainly used as an adsorbent for gases and liquids.\n\nFive \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m molecular sieves are used to dry [[natural gas]], along with performing [[desulfurization]] and [[carbonation|decarbonation]] of the gas. They can also be used to separate mixtures of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, and oil-wax n-hydrocarbons from branched and polycyclic hydrocarbons.\n\nFive \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m molecular sieves are stored at room temperature, with a [[relative humidity]] less than 90% in cardboard barrels or carton packaging. The molecular sieves should not be directly exposed to the air and water, acids and alkalis should be avoided.\n\n== Selecting molecular sieves ==\nMolecular sieves are available in different shape and sizes. But the spherical beads have advantage over other shapes as they offer lower pressure drop, are attrition resistant as they do not have any sharp edges, and have good strength, i.e. crush force required per unit area is higher. Certain beaded molecular sieves offer lower heat capacity thus lower energy requirements during regeneration.\n\nThe other advantage of using beaded molecular sieves is bulk density is usually higher than other shape, thus for same adsorption requirement molecular sieve volume required is less. Thus while doing de-bottlenecking you may use beaded molecular sieves, load more adsorbent in same volume, and avoid any vessel modifications.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Activated carbon]]\n* [[Desiccant]]\n* [[Lime (mineral)]]\n* [[Silica gel]]\n* [[Zeolite]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Scholia|topic}}\n* [http://www.physorg.com/news65284632.html Sieves Put A Lid On Greenhouse Gas]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716041353/http://www.sepcor.com/sievesafety.htm Molecular Sieve Safety]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160617033100/http://brownell.co.uk/products/desiccants/molecular-sieves.html About Molecular Sieves]\n\n[[Category:Filters]]\n[[Category:Desiccants]]\n[[Category:Vacuum]]\n[[Category:Chemical process engineering]]\n[[Category:Industrial gases]]\n[[Category:Gas technologies]]\n", "name_user": "Riventree", "label": "safe", "comment": "Overlink trimmed.

Like [[History of the Jews in Greater Cleveland|Cleveland's first Jews]], these immigrants came from [[Bavaria]].  4 synagogues were created in the 19th century; B\u2019nai Jeshurun, Temple Israel, Agudas Achim, and Beth Jacob.  After [[World War II]], many Jews moved east into [[Bexley, Ohio|Bexley]], [[Berwick, Columbus, Ohio|Berwick]], and [[Neighborhoods in Columbus, Ohio#Eastmoor|Eastmoor]], where many Jews and Jewish organizations remain today.

The Georgian Jews have an approximately 2,600-year history in the region.{{fact|date=July 2019}} The origin of Georgian Jews, also known as ''[[Gurjim]]'' or ''kartveli ebraelebi'', is debated. The most popular view is that the first Jews made their way to southern Georgia after [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar's]] conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BCE and exile in [[Babylon]]. This claim is supported by the [[medieval]] Georgian historical account by [[Leonti Mroveli]], who writes:\n\n{{quote|Then King Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem. The Jews who fled thence come to Kartli and requested from the mamasakhlisi [local ruler] of Mtskheta territory in return for tribute. He gave [a place] and settled them on the Aragvi, at spring which was called Zanavi, which was later renamed as Zanavi, the quarter of Jews.\".<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\"/>}}\n\nAnother version offered by Mroveli, was the settlement of the Jews in Georgia during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period of Emperor [[Vespasian]]. He wrote that Jews lived in Georgia long before 1st century AD. According to Mroveli:\n\n{{quote|During their [Bartom and Kartam's] reign, Vespasian, the emperor of the Romans, captured Jerusalem. From there refugee Jews come to Mtskheta and settled with the old Jews.\"<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\"/>}}\n\nThe ancient Georgian historic chronicle, ''The Conversion of Kartli'', is the oldest and only Georgian source concerning the history of the Jewish community in Georgia. The chronicle describes a version similar to that offered centuries later by Leonti Mroveli, but the period of Jewish migration into Georgia is ascribed to [[Alexander the Great]]:\n\n{{quote|...the warlike seed, the [[Honni]] [Jews], exiled by the Chaldeans, [came to Kartli] and requested the land for tribute from the Lord of the Bun T'urks [suburb of Mtskheta]. And they [Jews] settled in Zanavi. And they possessed it...<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\"/>}}\n[[File:View on Mtskheta from Jvari Monastery.JPG|250px|thumb|The ancient Georgian capital of [[Mtskheta]], where Jews lived for thousands of years]]\nGeorgian sources also refer to the arrival of the first Jews in Western Georgia from the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the 6th century AD. Approximately 3,000 of the Jews fled to Eastern Georgia, which by that time was controlled by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], to escape severe persecution by the Byzantines. The existence of the Jews in these regions during this period is supported by the [[archaeological]] evidence, which shows that Jews lived in [[Mtskheta]], the ancient capital of the Eastern Georgian state of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia-Kartli]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nAccording to the Georgian [[hagiography]], Jewish communities existed in Georgia in the 1st century. A Georgian Jew called Elias was said to be in Jerusalem during the [[Crucifixion]] and brought Jesus' robe back with him to Georgia.  He had acquired it from a Roman soldier at Golgotha.\n\nThe Jews spoke Georgian, and later Jewish traders developed a dialect called ''Kivruli'', or Judaeo-Georgian, which included a number of Hebrew words.\n\nIn the second half of the 7th century, the Muslim Empire conquered extensive Georgian territory, which became an [[Arab]] [[caliph]] province. Arab emirs ruled in the Georgian capital Tbilisi and surrounding territory for nearly 500 years, until 1122.\n\n[[Genetic studies on Jews|Genetic studies]] carried out on Georgian Jews as part of a wider survey showed close genetic links with other Jews, and in particular with Iraqi and Persian Jews. This seemed to prove the historical accounts of Jewish migration from Persia into Georgia.<ref>Begley, Sharon.

In the late 9th century, [[Abu-Imran Musa al-Za'farani]] (later known as Abu-Imran al-Tiflisi) founded a Jewish [[Karaite Judaism|Karai]] sect called the Tiflis Sect (\"Tiflisites\"), which lasted for more than 300 years. The sect deviated from [[Rabbinic]] ''[[halakhah]]'' in its marriage and ''[[kashrut]]'' customs. This sect did not represent the great majority of Georgian Jews, who adhered to traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism]] while maintaining strong religious ties with [[Baghdad]] and other [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Jews of Iraq]].<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |last1=Ben-Oren |first1=Gershon |title=The History of the Jews of Georgia until the Communist Regime |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/georgia |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> The nature of Georgian Jew's observance to rabbinic law was also noted by [[Benjamin of Tudela]] and [[Abraham ben David]] (also known as the RABAD or RAVAD).<ref name=\"bh.org.il\"/>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongols]] swept through Georgia in 1236, prompting many of the Jews of Eastern and Southern Georgia to move to the western region, which remained independent. There they formed small communities along the [[Black Sea]], and eventually their poverty forced them into [[serfdom]]. For 500 years, beginning in the end of the 14th century, the Jews of Georgia belonged to the ''kamani'', or serf class, under the Georgian elite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nTheir situation worsened in the 15th and 16th centuries due to constant military conflicts and invasions by [[Timur]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and Muslim [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. By the end of the 15th century, Georgia had fragmented into three separate kingdoms and five feudal territories. Jewish serfs were sold from master to master as a family or individuals as debt payments or gifts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The Jewish communities were torn apart and Jewish communal life was nearly impossible to maintain. Isolation and lack of a religious and spiritual center led to a decline of Jewish knowledge.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAn endless string of wars and rebellions characterized the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a result of Russian interference to the region, leaving the region decimated. Jewish property was often confiscated and Jews were forced to seek the protection of the local feudal lords. Instead of finding security, many Jews became enslaved by these lords. The serfs, including Jewish ones, were divided into three categories according to Georgian law: the King's serfs, Feudal serfs, and the Church's serfs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nDuring this period, large migrations of Jews took place, either voluntary or forced. In the 15th and 16th centuries, a large number of Jews left for, and many Jews in that region are still of Georgian descent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, tens of thousands of Jewish and non-Jewish Georgians were forcibly relocated to Persia by the Islamic Persian invaders.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Georgian annexation into the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Georgian JewsXIX.jpg|300px|thumb|Georgian Jews of Tbilisi probably around 1900]]\nIn 1801, the [[Russian Empire]] annexed Eastern Georgia. The King's serfs became the Treasury's serfs, and were obliged to pay taxes to the [[Tsar]]. In 1835 there were 1,363 Jews with 113 Karaites living in the town of [[Kutaisi|Kutais]] (Kutaisi) and its surroundings: 1,040 in Gori, 623 in Akhaltsikhe, and 61 in Tiflis (Tbilisi). The total Jewish population of Georgia and the region beyond the Caucasus was 12,234.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 1864\u201371, the Russian authorities abolished [[serfdom]], and Jewish former serfs moved to towns and villages where free Jews were already settled. Finally the Jews of Georgia began to develop Jewish communities.  Each group moved together to the same towns and established their own respective [[synagogues]]. They were usually made up of a number of extended family groups spanning three or four generations. Each community had a [[gabbai]] who served as a [[rabbi]], [[shohet]], [[mohel]], and [[Cheder]], and oversaw religious and communal affairs. These small communities developed into the Jewish quarter of their particular towns.\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Russian Jews were forced to move to Georgia by the Russian government. The Ashkenazi Jews and the Georgian Jews began establishing contact with each other, but relations were strained. Georgian Jews viewed the Ashkenazim as godless and [[secular]], while the Ashkenazim looked down on the Georgian Jews.\n\n[[Zionism]] was a uniting cause for the two groups.  Ashkenazim joined Zionist organizations and began to spread their ideas to the Georgian Jewish communities. In 1897, the first Zionist organization was established in Tbilisi. On 20 August 1901, the [[First Congress of Caucasus Zionists]] was held in Tbilisi. Rabbi [[David Baazov]] led Georgian Zionism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1903, Baazov attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1918, the [[All-Jewish Congress in Tbilisi]] took place and included representatives from every Georgian and Russian Jewish community in the country.\n\nBeginning in 1863, groups of Jews began making [[aliyah]], mostly for religious reasons. By 1916, 439 Georgian Jews lived in [[Israel]], mostly in [[Jerusalem]] near the [[Damascus Gate]]. Most Jews who made aliyah were poor and worked as freight-handlers in Jerusalem. Other more prominent Georgian Jews served as financiers and carpet merchants. Prominent Georgian Jewish families in the holy land before 1948 were the Dabra ([[Davarashvili]]) and Kokia ([[Kakiashvili]]) families.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Anti-Semitism under the Tsarist Government===\nThe tradition of the relationship between Jews and other Georgians has no signs of [[anti-Semitism]], excluding the Tsarist Government. For many centuries, the Church in Georgia did not incite against the Jews, and the Georgian Jews were visibly assimilated in the country's rural life and culture.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"/>\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, there were some outbreaks of anti-Semitic acts, perhaps stemming from the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Anti-Semitism was supplemented by the end of serfdom and the urbanization of the Jewish population. As Jews became traders instead of field hands, Georgian workers began to see them as competitors and economic threats. Anti-Semitism had been active in Russia for centuries and, under the annexation, began to influence non-Jews in Georgia.\n\nSix [[blood libel]]s have been recorded as having taken place in Georgia. The first blood libel was in [[Surami]] in 1850. A little boy from Gori disappeared while on a visit with his parents. The child was found dead after four days, and the Jews were blamed for his death. The [[guberniya]] doctor examined the dead child and concluded that he was drowned. The people blamed the Jews and started riots against the Jews. Only the intervention of the head of the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1844-1881)|Viceroyalty]] avoided more problems.\n\nThe worst and most infamous case was in the village of [[Sachkhere]] in 1878, when nine Jews were accused of partaking in the ritual killing of a Christian child to use the blood to make [[matzah]] for [[Passover]]. The highly publicized trial occurred in [[Kutaisi]], and was called the Kutaisi Trial. The accused were found not guilty, but the blood libels continued.\n\n===Revolution and independence===\n[[File:Kutaisi cemetery of Jews 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Old Jewish cemetery in [[Kutaisi]]]]\n[[File:Bandza Synagogue.JPG|300px|thumb|Old Synagogue (20th century) in [[Bandza]], [[Martvili Municipality]]]]\n\nAfter the October 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] threw out the Tsar's government and replaced it with the [[Bolsheviks]], Georgians clamored for independence from their occupiers. On 26 May 1918, the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgian Republic]] declared its independence. With independence came freedom of speech, press, and organization, which improved the economic situation of the Jews of Georgia. This newfound freedom did not last long. The [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army invaded Georgia]] in February 1921, prompting a mass exodus from the region. Approximately 1,500\u20132,000 Jews left Georgia, 1,000\u20131,200 of whom settled in Israel. The remainder fled mainly to [[Istanbul]], where a Georgian Jewish community had been in existence since the 1880s.\n\n[[File:Shalom Koboshvili. Feast of Sukkot prayers. gouache on paper. 30.5\u00d741 cm. 1938.jpg|thumb|250px|''Feast of [[Sukkot]]'', [[Shalom Koboshvili]], 1938]]\nInitially, the Soviets allowed the Jews to maintain their religious customs, but after a [[August Uprising|Georgian rebellion in 1924]], the Bolshevik government terminated all Zionist activity, imposed economic restrictions, and generally discriminated against the Jewish community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} As a result, many Jewish businesses were bankrupted and 200 families applied for exit visas. Only 18 were allowed to emigrate. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the mid-1920s, the Soviets focused on industrializing and secularizing the Jews of Georgia. Mass numbers of Jews were forced to work in factories or to join craft cooperatives and collective farm projects. In 1927\u20131928, OZET, the organization for settling Jewish workers on farms, established a number of Jewish [[collective farms]]. These small homogeneous communities became isolated Jewish communities where Jewish learning was continued. Recognizing this, the Communists disbanded the communities in the 1930s, scattering the Jews among various farms and destroying Jewish communal life. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMeanwhile, blood libels continued in full force, with occurrences in Sachkhere in 1921, Tbilisi in 1923, and [[Akhaltsikhe]] in 1926.\n\nDue to Soviet persecution and the declining economic situation, Zionist leaders focused on increasing aliyah efforts. The Soviets firmly opposed Jewish emigration and, during the 1930s, cracked down on Zionist organizations, arresting or murdering many members. In 1937\u201338, the authorities stifled participation in Jewish religious services or cultural activities. In September 1937, nine [[hakham]]s, two of whom were Ashkenazi, were arrested in [[Tskhinvali]] (Staliniri at the time), and sent to prison without trial and murdered.\n\nThe only surviving Jewish institution was the [[David Baazov Museum of History of Jews of Georgia|History and Ethnography Museum]], but it too was soon closed down. Its director, [[Aharon Krikheli]] was arrested in 1948, and the museum closed in the early 1950s, thus signifying the annihilation of Jewish culture in Georgia, which the Soviets had built up during the prewar years.\n\n===Contemporary Georgia===\n[[File:Oni Synagogue.jpg|300px|thumb|Old Synagogue in [[Oni, Georgia|Oni]]]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], thousands of Georgian Jews served in the [[Red Army]]. After the war, the authorities arrested Jews and closed or destroyed synagogues, and anti-Semitic acts of violence erupted. But despite their attempts, the Soviets could not completely annihilate the practice of Judaism and, even in the late 1960s and 1970s, most Georgian Jews managed to observe their traditions. Georgian Jews were able to preserve their identity better than Jews in European parts of the Soviet Union, and assimilated and intermarried less. Throughout Soviet rule, Jews remained society's scapegoat. They made up the majority of Georgians convicted for economic crimes, and were punished more severely than the rest of the population. Blood libels continued with incidents in [[Tskhaltubo]] in 1963, [[Zestafoni]] in 1964, and Kutaisi in 1965.\n\nAfter the [[Six-Day War]], huge numbers of Soviet Jews began protesting for the right to immigrate to [[Israel]], and many applied for exit visas. Georgian Jews made up a large percentage of this number. They were among the very first to begin protesting, and were among the most militant of campaigners. In August 1969, eighteen families wrote to the [[Human Rights Commission of the United Nations]] demanding permission to make aliyah. This was the first public insistence by Soviet Jews for immigration to Israel. The Israeli government and the Jewish world campaigned heavily on behalf of the plight of the Soviet Jewry. In July 1971, a group of Georgian Jews went on a hunger strike outside a [[Moscow]] post office. The determination of Soviet Jewish activists and international pressure led the Soviets to lessen their harsh anti-Jewish policies. During the 1970s, the Soviets permitted limited Jewish emigration to Israel, and about 30,000 Georgian Jews made aliyah, with thousands of others leaving for other countries. Approximately 17% of the Soviet Jewish population emigrated at this time. In 1979, the Jewish population in Georgia was 28,300 and, by 1989, it had decreased to 24,800.\n\nWhile most Soviet Jewish emigration was individual, Georgian-Jewish emigration was communal. Due to Georgian-Jewish traditions of strong, extended families and the strict, patriarchal nature of Georgian families, Georgians immigrated as whole communities, with emigration of individuals causing a chain reaction leading to more emigration, and brought their community structures with them. For example, nearly the entire population of at least two Georgian towns made aliyah. At the time the emigration started, Israel had a policy of scattering the population around the country, and was experiencing a housing shortage, with the result that Georgians were assigned housing in different parts of the country. The Georgians began demanding that they be concentrated together, and the crisis reached a fever pitch when several families threatened to return to Georgia, and new immigrants, forewarned by predecessors, began demanding to be placed in specific areas upon arrival. Although Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] criticized the Georgians' desire to \"isolate themselves into ghettos\", the Israeli Immigrant Absorption Ministry eventually bowed to their demands, and began to create concentrations of around 200 families in twelve areas of the country.<ref name=curtis />\n\nIn Israel, Georgian immigrants successfully integrated into society, but faced certain problems. Georgian immigrants were usually able to find jobs with ease, and often worked in light industry jobs, such as dock workers, porters, and construction workers, but faced certain issues. One major issue was religion; the Georgian Jews were often devout and had fiercely clung to their traditions in the Soviet Union, and were stunned to discover that Israeli Jews were mostly secular. As a result, Georgian immigrants demanded their own separate synagogues to continue their unique religious traditions, which the government agreed to, and enrolled their children in religious schools rather than regular schools.<ref name=curtis>Michael Curtis, Mordecai S. Chertoff: ''Israel: Social Structure and Change''.</ref>\n\n===Independence and Georgia today===\n[[File:Tbilisi israeli2007.jpg|250px|thumb|Israel's 60th independence day celebration in Tbilisi, Georgia attended by Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]]]\nAfter the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], Georgia declared her independence in 1991. Since independence, the country faced continuous military conflict, leaving the region in political and economic turmoil.\n\nThe situation of the Jewish community of Georgia improved dramatically due to the end of the Soviet occupation. In 1994, President [[Edward Shevardnadze|Shevardnadze]] issued a decree to protect Jewish religious, cultural and historic monuments. In addition, the Jews of Georgia have successfully maintained their Jewish identity and traditions despite the oppression they faced under the Soviets. Intermarriage has always been low and levels of Jewish knowledge are significantly higher than those of other CIS republics.\n\nIn 1990, the [[Rachamim Society]] was established, which supplies financial and medical support to the Jews of Tbilisi and maintains Jewish cemeteries and synagogues. It functions as an umbrella organization for Ashkenazi Jews. The Association of Georgian Jews (Derekh Yehudi) focuses on regaining Jewish property confiscated during the Soviet era. The Jewish community still faces acts of violence and obstacles in the return of property rights to a 19th-century Ashkenazi synagogue stolen by the Soviets. The Chief Rabbi of Georgia from Chabad Lubavitsch is Rabbi Avraham Michaelshvili, who has been there since the early 1990s hosting the Georgian community and many guests with fervor and devotion. There was a further Chief Rabbi [[Ariel Levin]]. Rabbi Ariel Levine Returned to Israel. He was taken over by the Vaad l\u2019Hatzolas Nidchei Yisroel affiliated Rabbi Avimelech Rosenblath. There is no umbrella organization for all Jews in Georgia, but more than 30 Jewish institutions are in existence, in addition to one Jewish day school and four supplementary schools. Three Jewish newspapers are published - ''Menora'', ''Shalom'', and ''26 Century'', and there is also a Jewish radio and television station.\n[[File:Tbilisi synagogue, Hanukkah - prayer 02.jpg|190px|thumb|Tbilisi Synagogue, Hanukkah prayer]]\nThe Jewish population of Georgia has steadily decreased over the years due to aliyah in response to the political and economic issues since independence. Overall, since 1989, 21,134 Jews have moved to [[Israel]]. Once numbering as many as 100,000, today the Georgian Jewish population is approximately 13,000. Tbilisi has the largest Jewish population at 11,000 out of 1.5 million. Jewish communities are located in Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Batumi, [[Oni, Georgia|Oni]], [[Akhaltsikhe]], [[Akhalkalaki]], [[Surami]], [[Kareli, Georgia|Kareli]], and Stalin's hometown of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], and synagogues are located in most of these cities. The provinces of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] are virtually devoid of Jews due to the military conflicts in these areas. Many Abkhazian Jews emigrated to [[Israel]] from Abkhazia during the war in the 1990s there, while the few who stayed are mostly elderly. A synagogue is still active in Sukhumi. There is one Jew left in South Ossetia (see articles [[History of the Jews in Abkhazia]] and [[History of the Jews in South Ossetia]]).\n\nIn January 2001, in a first step toward establishing relations, the [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox Church]] and the Jewish community of Georgia signed a cooperation agreement of mutual respect and support. Relations between Georgia and Israel are warm, however. The Israeli embassy is located in Tbilisi and also serves Armenia; the Georgian embassy is in [[Tel Aviv]]. Israel has supplied humanitarian aid to Georgia a number of times, including drought assistance and aid for earthquake victims.\n\nThe Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI) and American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) both have permanent representatives in Georgia. JDC and Hesed Eliyahu distribute food and medical aid to the Jewish elderly, who make up more than 50% of the Georgian Jewish community.\n\nAs a result of the [[2008 South Ossetia War]], some 200 Georgian Jews immigrated to [[Israel]] with assistance from the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]].<ref>[http://www.jewishinstlouis.org/page.aspx?id=182783 100 Georgian Jews Make Aliyah to Israel since outbreak of crisis]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Besides speaking Judaeo-Georgian, the Georgian Jews speak the languages of the peoples surrounding them.  In Georgia, these include Georgian and [[Russian language|Russian]]; in Belgium, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; in the United States and Canada [[English language|English]]; and in Israel, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].\n\n==''Aliyah'' and Diaspora Outside of Georgia==\n{{main|Georgian Jews in Israel}}\nMany Georgian Jews now live in [[Israel]]. In the [[United States]], the principal Georgian Jewish synagogue is the [[Congregation of Georgian Jews]] in the [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] section of [[Queens, New York|Queens]], [[New York City]]. In [[Belgium]], most Georgian Jews are member of the [[Jewish community of Antwerp|Antwerp Jewish community]]. The main Georgian synagogue in Belgium is on Isabellalei in Antwerpen, and is led by rabbi Avishalom Kalazan of Yemenite origin. Most of the community is engaged in jewelry trade, with the new generation going into more diverse directions. A second Georgian Jewish synagogue became active around year 2012 under leadership of rabbi Yitzhak Pichkhadze. One notable Georgian Jew in USA is [[Tamir Sapir]], born Temur Sepiashvili, an immigrant taxi driver turned businessman from New York.

There are Georgian Jews in [[Jerusalem]] as well, with several prominent synagogues. This trend of concentrated communities of Georgian Jews in Israel has changed and the population is much more integrated now, is more homogeneously dispersed in the country, and is now successfully integrated in every sphere of the society.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Resource==\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=279&letter=C '''Caucasus''' article in the Jewish Encyclopedia]\n\n{{Portal|Georgia (country)|Judaism}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.georgianjews.org/ World Congress of Georgian Jews]\n*[http://www.georgianjews.org/stat.php?id=267&lang=en ''Way of life and customs''] by Rachel Arbel and Lili Magal from World Congress of Georgian Jews\n*[http://www.haaretz.com/video/1.640351 WATCH: Forget Atlanta - this is the Georgia on my mind], ''[[Haaretz]]''\n\n{{Asia topic|History of the Jews in}}\n{{History of the Jews in Europe}}\n{{Mizrahi Jews topics}}\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n[[Category:Jews from Georgia (country)| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Jewish history by country|Georgia]]\n[[Category:Georgia (country)\u2013Israel relations| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish ethnic group}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}\n[[Image:Georgia (orthographic projection with inset).svg|thumb|The location of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (dark and light green) in [[Eurasia]]]]\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group    = Georgian Jews<br/>\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d4\u10d1\u10e0\u10d0\u10d4\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8<br/>\n| image    = File:A Jew from Akhaltsikhe (Ermakov) BW.jpg\n\n| population  = '''250,000'''\n| region1  = {{flagcountry|Israel}}\n| pop1     = '''200,000'''\n| region2  = {{flagcountry|USA}}\n| pop2     = '''10,000'''\n| region3  = {{flagcountry|Georgia}}\n| pop3     = '''8,600'''\n| region4  = {{flag|Russia}}\n| pop4     = '''1,800'''\n| ref4     = <ref>[http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/tab5.xls Russian Census 2010: Population by ethnicity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424113952/http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/tab5.xls |date=24 April 2012 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n| region5  = {{flagcountry|Belgium}}\n| pop5     = '''1,200'''\n| region6  = {{flagcountry|Austria}}\n| pop6     = '''800'''\n| region7  = {{flagcountry|Azerbaijan}}\n| pop7     = '''500'''\n| langs    = [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[English language|English]], [[Judaeo-Georgian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] \n| rels     = [[Judaism]]\n| related  = ([[Sephardim]], [[Ashkenazim]], [[Mizrahim]], etc.)<br />\n[[Jews]], [[Georgians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<br />\nother [[Jewish ethnic divisions]]\n}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}\n{{History of Georgia (country)}}\n{{Georgians}}\n'''Georgian Jews''' ({{lang-ka|\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d4\u10d1\u10e0\u10d0\u10d4\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8|tr}}) are one of the oldest communities in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], tracing their migration into the country during the [[Babylonian captivity]] in 6th century BC.<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\">The Wellspring of Georgian Historiography: The Early Medieval Historical Chronicle The Conversion of Katli and The Life of St. Nino, Constantine B.

According to the 2002 First General National Census of Georgia, there are 3,541 Jewish believers in the country.<ref>[http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=145&plang=1 Statistics of Georgia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831235152/http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=145&plang=1 |date=31 August 2006 }}</ref> For example, the [[Lezgishvili]] branch of Georgian Jews have families in [[Israel]], [[Moscow]], [[Baku]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] (US). Several hundred Georgian Jewish families live in the [[Tri-State Region|New York tri-state area]], particularly in [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]].\n\n===Origins===\nGeorgian-speaking Jewry is one of the oldest surviving Jewish communities in the world. The Georgian Jews have an approximately 2,600-year history in the region.{{fact|date=July 2019}} The origin of Georgian Jews, also known as ''[[Gurjim]]'' or ''kartveli ebraelebi'', is debated. The most popular view is that the first Jews made their way to southern Georgia after [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar's]] conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BCE and exile in [[Babylon]]. This claim is supported by the [[medieval]] Georgian historical account by [[Leonti Mroveli]], who writes:\n\n{{quote|Then King Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem. The Jews who fled thence come to Kartli and requested from the mamasakhlisi [local ruler] of Mtskheta territory in return for tribute. He gave [a place] and settled them on the Aragvi, at spring which was called Zanavi, which was later renamed as Zanavi, the quarter of Jews.\".<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\"/>}}\n\nAnother version offered by Mroveli, was the settlement of the Jews in Georgia during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period of Emperor [[Vespasian]]. He wrote that Jews lived in Georgia long before 1st century AD. According to Mroveli:\n\n{{quote|During their [Bartom and Kartam's] reign, Vespasian, the emperor of the Romans, captured Jerusalem. From there refugee Jews come to Mtskheta and settled with the old Jews.\"<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\"/>}}\n\nThe ancient Georgian historic chronicle, ''The Conversion of Kartli'', is the oldest and only Georgian source concerning the history of the Jewish community in Georgia. The chronicle describes a version similar to that offered centuries later by Leonti Mroveli, but the period of Jewish migration into Georgia is ascribed to [[Alexander the Great]]:\n\n{{quote|...the warlike seed, the [[Honni]] [Jews], exiled by the Chaldeans, [came to Kartli] and requested the land for tribute from the Lord of the Bun T'urks [suburb of Mtskheta]. And they [Jews] settled in Zanavi. And they possessed it...<ref name=\"Georgian Historiography 2004, p. 60\"/>}}\n[[File:View on Mtskheta from Jvari Monastery.JPG|250px|thumb|The ancient Georgian capital of [[Mtskheta]], where Jews lived for thousands of years]]\nGeorgian sources also refer to the arrival of the first Jews in Western Georgia from the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the 6th century AD. Approximately 3,000 of the Jews fled to Eastern Georgia, which by that time was controlled by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], to escape severe persecution by the Byzantines. The existence of the Jews in these regions during this period is supported by the [[archaeological]] evidence, which shows that Jews lived in [[Mtskheta]], the ancient capital of the Eastern Georgian state of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia-Kartli]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nAccording to the Georgian [[hagiography]], Jewish communities existed in Georgia in the 1st century. A Georgian Jew called Elias was said to be in Jerusalem during the [[Crucifixion]] and brought Jesus' robe back with him to Georgia.  He had acquired it from a Roman soldier at Golgotha.\n\nThe Jews spoke Georgian, and later Jewish traders developed a dialect called ''Kivruli'', or Judaeo-Georgian, which included a number of Hebrew words.\n\nIn the second half of the 7th century, the Muslim Empire conquered extensive Georgian territory, which became an [[Arab]] [[caliph]] province. Arab emirs ruled in the Georgian capital Tbilisi and surrounding territory for nearly 500 years, until 1122.\n\n[[Genetic studies on Jews|Genetic studies]] carried out on Georgian Jews as part of a wider survey showed close genetic links with other Jews, and in particular with Iraqi and Persian Jews. This seemed to prove the historical accounts of Jewish migration from Persia into Georgia.<ref>Begley, Sharon.

In the late 9th century, [[Abu-Imran Musa al-Za'farani]] (later known as Abu-Imran al-Tiflisi) founded a Jewish [[Karaite Judaism|Karai]] sect called the Tiflis Sect (\"Tiflisites\"), which lasted for more than 300 years. The sect deviated from [[Rabbinic]] ''[[halakhah]]'' in its marriage and ''[[kashrut]]'' customs. This sect did not represent the great majority of Georgian Jews, who adhered to traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism]] while maintaining strong religious ties with [[Baghdad]] and other [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Jews of Iraq]].<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |last1=Ben-Oren |first1=Gershon |title=The History of the Jews of Georgia until the Communist Regime |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/georgia |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> The nature of Georgian Jew's observance to rabbinic law was also noted by [[Benjamin of Tudela]] and [[Abraham ben David]] (also known as the RABAD or RAVAD).<ref name=\"bh.org.il\"/>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongols]] swept through Georgia in 1236, prompting many of the Jews of Eastern and Southern Georgia to move to the western region, which remained independent. There they formed small communities along the [[Black Sea]], and eventually their poverty forced them into [[serfdom]]. For 500 years, beginning in the end of the 14th century, the Jews of Georgia belonged to the ''kamani'', or serf class, under the Georgian elite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nTheir situation worsened in the 15th and 16th centuries due to constant military conflicts and invasions by [[Timur]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and Muslim [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. By the end of the 15th century, Georgia had fragmented into three separate kingdoms and five feudal territories. Jewish serfs were sold from master to master as a family or individuals as debt payments or gifts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The Jewish communities were torn apart and Jewish communal life was nearly impossible to maintain. Isolation and lack of a religious and spiritual center led to a decline of Jewish knowledge.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAn endless string of wars and rebellions characterized the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a result of Russian interference to the region, leaving the region decimated. Jewish property was often confiscated and Jews were forced to seek the protection of the local feudal lords. Instead of finding security, many Jews became enslaved by these lords. The serfs, including Jewish ones, were divided into three categories according to Georgian law: the King's serfs, Feudal serfs, and the Church's serfs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nDuring this period, large migrations of Jews took place, either voluntary or forced. In the 15th and 16th centuries, a large number of Jews left for, and many Jews in that region are still of Georgian descent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, tens of thousands of Jewish and non-Jewish Georgians were forcibly relocated to Persia by the Islamic Persian invaders.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Georgian annexation into the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Georgian JewsXIX.jpg|300px|thumb|Georgian Jews of Tbilisi probably around 1900]]\nIn 1801, the [[Russian Empire]] annexed Eastern Georgia. The King's serfs became the Treasury's serfs, and were obliged to pay taxes to the [[Tsar]]. In 1835 there were 1,363 Jews with 113 Karaites living in the town of [[Kutaisi|Kutais]] (Kutaisi) and its surroundings: 1,040 in Gori, 623 in Akhaltsikhe, and 61 in Tiflis (Tbilisi). The total Jewish population of Georgia and the region beyond the Caucasus was 12,234.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 1864-71, the Russian authorities abolished [[serfdom]], and Jewish former serfs moved to towns and villages where free Jews were already settled. Finally the Jews of Georgia began to develop Jewish communities.  Each group moved together to the same towns and established their own respective [[synagogues]]. They were usually made up of a number of extended family groups spanning three or four generations. Each community had a [[gabbai]] who served as a [[rabbi]], [[shohet]], [[mohel]], and [[Cheder]], and oversaw religious and communal affairs. These small communities developed into the Jewish quarter of their particular towns.\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Russian Jews were forced to move to Georgia by the Russian government. The Ashkenazi Jews and the Georgian Jews began establishing contact with each other, but relations were strained. Georgian Jews viewed the Ashkenazim as godless and [[secular]], while the Ashkenazim looked down on the Georgian Jews.\n\n[[Zionism]] was a uniting cause for the two groups.  Ashkenazim joined Zionist organizations and began to spread their ideas to the Georgian Jewish communities. In 1897, the first Zionist organization was established in Tbilisi. On 20 August 1901, the [[First Congress of Caucasus Zionists]] was held in Tbilisi. Rabbi [[David Baazov]] led Georgian Zionism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1903, Baazov attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1918, the [[All-Jewish Congress in Tbilisi]] took place and included representatives from every Georgian and Russian Jewish community in the country.\n\nBeginning in 1863, groups of Jews began making [[aliyah]], mostly for religious reasons. By 1916, 439 Georgian Jews lived in [[Israel]], mostly in [[Jerusalem]] near the [[Damascus Gate]]. Most Jews who made aliyah were poor and worked as freight-handlers in Jerusalem. Other more prominent Georgian Jews served as financiers and carpet merchants. Prominent Georgian Jewish families in the holy land before 1948 were the Dabra ([[Davarashvili]]) and Kokia ([[Kakiashvili]]) families.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Anti-Semitism under the Tsarist Government===\nThe tradition of the relationship between Jews and other Georgians has no signs of [[anti-Semitism]], excluding the Tsarist Government. For many centuries, the Church in Georgia did not incite against the Jews, and the Georgian Jews were visibly assimilated in the country's rural life and culture.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"/>\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, there were some outbreaks of anti-Semitic acts, perhaps stemming from the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Anti-Semitism was supplemented by the end of serfdom and the urbanization of the Jewish population. As Jews became traders instead of field hands, Georgian workers began to see them as competitors and economic threats. Anti-Semitism had been active in Russia for centuries and, under the annexation, began to influence non-Jews in Georgia.\n\nSix [[blood libel]]s have been recorded as having taken place in Georgia. The first blood libel was in [[Surami]] in 1850. A little boy from Gori disappeared while on a visit with his parents. The child was found dead after four days, and the Jews were blamed for his death. The [[guberniya]] doctor examined the dead child and concluded that he was drowned. The people blamed the Jews and started riots against the Jews. Only the intervention of the head of the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1844-1881)|Viceroyalty]] avoided more problems.\n\nThe worst and most infamous case was in the village of [[Sachkhere]] in 1878, when nine Jews were accused of partaking in the ritual killing of a Christian child to use the blood to make [[matzah]] for [[Passover]]. The highly publicized trial occurred in [[Kutaisi]], and was called the Kutaisi Trial. The accused were found not guilty, but the blood libels continued.\n\n===Revolution and independence===\n[[File:Kutaisi cemetery of Jews 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Old Jewish cemetery in [[Kutaisi]]]]\n[[File:Bandza Synagogue.JPG|300px|thumb|Old Synagogue (20th century) in [[Bandza]], [[Martvili Municipality]]]]\n\nAfter the October 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] threw out the Tsar's government and replaced it with the [[Bolsheviks]], Georgians clamored for independence from their occupiers. On 26 May 1918, the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgian Republic]] declared its independence. With independence came freedom of speech, press, and organization, which improved the economic situation of the Jews of Georgia. This newfound freedom did not last long. The [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army invaded Georgia]] in February 1921, prompting a mass exodus from the region. Approximately 1,500\u20132,000 Jews left Georgia, 1,000\u20131,200 of whom settled in Israel. The remainder fled mainly to [[Istanbul]], where a Georgian Jewish community had been in existence since the 1880s.\n\n[[File:Shalom Koboshvili. Feast of Sukkot prayers. gouache on paper. 30.5\u00d741 cm. 1938.jpg|thumb|250px|''Feast of [[Sukkot]]'', [[Shalom Koboshvili]], 1938]]\nInitially, the Soviets allowed the Jews to maintain their religious customs, but after a [[August Uprising|Georgian rebellion in 1924]], the Bolshevik government terminated all Zionist activity, imposed economic restrictions, and generally discriminated against the Jewish community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} As a result, many Jewish businesses were bankrupted and 200 families applied for exit visas. Only 18 were allowed to emigrate. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the mid-1920s, the Soviets focused on industrializing and secularizing the Jews of Georgia. Mass numbers of Jews were forced to work in factories or to join craft cooperatives and collective farm projects. In 1927\u20131928, OZET, the organization for settling Jewish workers on farms, established a number of Jewish [[collective farms]]. These small homogeneous communities became isolated Jewish communities where Jewish learning was continued. Recognizing this, the Communists disbanded the communities in the 1930s, scattering the Jews among various farms and destroying Jewish communal life. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMeanwhile, blood libels continued in full force, with occurrences in Sachkhere in 1921, Tbilisi in 1923, and [[Akhaltsikhe]] in 1926.\n\nDue to Soviet persecution and the declining economic situation, Zionist leaders focused on increasing aliyah efforts. The Soviets firmly opposed Jewish emigration and, during the 1930s, cracked down on Zionist organizations, arresting or murdering many members. In 1937-38, the authorities stifled participation in Jewish religious services or cultural activities. In September 1937, nine [[hakham]]s, two of whom were Ashkenazi, were arrested in [[Tskhinvali]] (Staliniri at the time), and sent to prison without trial and murdered.\n\nThe only surviving Jewish institution was the [[David Baazov Museum of History of Jews of Georgia|History and Ethnography Museum]], but it too was soon closed down. Its director, [[Aharon Krikheli]] was arrested in 1948, and the museum closed in the early 1950s, thus signifying the annihilation of Jewish culture in Georgia, which the Soviets had built up during the prewar years.\n\n===Contemporary Georgia===\n[[File:Oni Synagogue.jpg|300px|thumb|Old Synagogue in [[Oni, Georgia|Oni]]]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], thousands of Georgian Jews served in the [[Red Army]]. After the war, the authorities arrested Jews and closed or destroyed synagogues, and anti-Semitic acts of violence erupted. But despite their attempts, the Soviets could not completely annihilate the practice of Judaism and, even in the late 1960s and 1970s, most Georgian Jews managed to observe their traditions. Georgian Jews were able to preserve their identity better than Jews in European parts of the Soviet Union, and assimilated and intermarried less. Throughout Soviet rule, Jews remained society's scapegoat. They made up the majority of Georgians convicted for economic crimes, and were punished more severely than the rest of the population. Blood libels continued with incidents in [[Tskhaltubo]] in 1963, [[Zestafoni]] in 1964, and Kutaisi in 1965.\n\nAfter the [[Six-Day War]], huge numbers of Soviet Jews began protesting for the right to immigrate to [[Israel]], and many applied for exit visas. Georgian Jews made up a large percentage of this number. They were among the very first to begin protesting, and were among the most militant of campaigners. In August 1969, eighteen families wrote to the [[Human Rights Commission of the United Nations]] demanding permission to make aliyah. This was the first public insistence by Soviet Jews for immigration to Israel. The Israeli government and the Jewish world campaigned heavily on behalf of the plight of the Soviet Jewry. In July 1971, a group of Georgian Jews went on a hunger strike outside a [[Moscow]] post office. The determination of Soviet Jewish activists and international pressure led the Soviets to lessen their harsh anti-Jewish policies. During the 1970s, the Soviets permitted limited Jewish emigration to Israel, and about 30,000 Georgian Jews made aliyah, with thousands of others leaving for other countries. Approximately 17% of the Soviet Jewish population emigrated at this time. In 1979, the Jewish population in Georgia was 28,300 and, by 1989, it had decreased to 24,800.\n\nWhile most Soviet Jewish emigration was individual, Georgian-Jewish emigration was communal. Due to Georgian-Jewish traditions of strong, extended families and the strict, patriarchal nature of Georgian families, Georgians immigrated as whole communities, with emigration of individuals causing a chain reaction leading to more emigration, and brought their community structures with them. For example, nearly the entire population of at least two Georgian towns made aliyah. At the time the emigration started, Israel had a policy of scattering the population around the country, and was experiencing a housing shortage, with the result that Georgians were assigned housing in different parts of the country. The Georgians began demanding that they be concentrated together, and the crisis reached a fever pitch when several families threatened to return to Georgia, and new immigrants, forewarned by predecessors, began demanding to be placed in specific areas upon arrival. Although Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] criticized the Georgians' desire to \"isolate themselves into ghettos\", the Israeli Immigrant Absorption Ministry eventually bowed to their demands, and began to create concentrations of around 200 families in twelve areas of the country.<ref name=curtis />\n\nIn Israel, Georgian immigrants successfully integrated into society, but faced certain problems. Georgian immigrants were usually able to find jobs with ease, and often worked in light industry jobs, such as dock workers, porters, and construction workers, but faced certain issues. One major issue was religion; the Georgian Jews were often devout and had fiercely clung to their traditions in the Soviet Union, and were stunned to discover that Israeli Jews were mostly secular. As a result, Georgian immigrants demanded their own separate synagogues to continue their unique religious traditions, which the government agreed to, and enrolled their children in religious schools rather than regular schools.<ref name=curtis>Michael Curtis, Mordecai S. Chertoff: ''Israel: Social Structure and Change''.</ref>\n\n===Independence and Georgia today===\n[[File:Tbilisi israeli2007.jpg|250px|thumb|Israel's 60th independence day celebration in Tbilisi, Georgia attended by Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]]]\nAfter the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], Georgia declared her independence in 1991. Since independence, the country faced continuous military conflict, leaving the region in political and economic turmoil.\n\nThe situation of the Jewish community of Georgia improved dramatically due to the end of the Soviet occupation. In 1994, President [[Edward Shevardnadze|Shevardnadze]] issued a decree to protect Jewish religious, cultural and historic monuments. In addition, the Jews of Georgia have successfully maintained their Jewish identity and traditions despite the oppression they faced under the Soviets. Intermarriage has always been low and levels of Jewish knowledge are significantly higher than those of other CIS republics.\n\nIn 1990, the [[Rachamim Society]] was established, which supplies financial and medical support to the Jews of Tbilisi and maintains Jewish cemeteries and synagogues. It functions as an umbrella organization for Ashkenazi Jews. The Association of Georgian Jews (Derekh Yehudi) focuses on regaining Jewish property confiscated during the Soviet era. The Jewish community still faces acts of violence and obstacles in the return of property rights to a 19th-century Ashkenazi synagogue stolen by the Soviets. The Chief Rabbi of Georgia from Chabad Lubavitsch is Rabbi Avraham Michaelshvili, who has been there since the early 1990s hosting the Georgian community and many guests with fervor and devotion. There was a further Chief Rabbi [[Ariel Levin]]. Rabbi Ariel Levine Returned to Israel. He was taken over by the Vaad l\u2019Hatzolas Nidchei Yisroel affiliated Rabbi Avimelech Rosenblath. There is no umbrella organization for all Jews in Georgia, but more than 30 Jewish institutions are in existence, in addition to one Jewish day school and four supplementary schools. Three Jewish newspapers are published - ''Menora'', ''Shalom'', and ''26 Century'', and there is also a Jewish radio and television station.\n[[File:Tbilisi synagogue, Hanukkah - prayer 02.jpg|190px|thumb|Tbilisi Synagogue, Hanukkah prayer]]\nThe Jewish population of Georgia has steadily decreased over the years due to aliyah in response to the political and economic issues since independence. Overall, since 1989, 21,134 Jews have moved to [[Israel]]. Once numbering as many as 100,000, today the Georgian Jewish population is approximately 13,000. Tbilisi has the largest Jewish population at 11,000 out of 1.5 million. Jewish communities are located in Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Batumi, [[Oni, Georgia|Oni]], [[Akhaltsikhe]], [[Akhalkalaki]], [[Surami]], [[Kareli, Georgia|Kareli]], and Stalin's hometown of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], and synagogues are located in most of these cities. The provinces of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] are virtually devoid of Jews due to the military conflicts in these areas. Many Abkhazian Jews emigrated to [[Israel]] from Abkhazia during the war in the 1990s there, while the few who stayed are mostly elderly. A synagogue is still active in Sukhumi. There is one Jew left in South Ossetia (see articles [[History of the Jews in Abkhazia]] and [[History of the Jews in South Ossetia]]).\n\nIn January 2001, in a first step toward establishing relations, the [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Georgian Orthodox Church]] and the Jewish community of Georgia signed a cooperation agreement of mutual respect and support. Relations between Georgia and Israel are warm, however. The Israeli embassy is located in Tbilisi and also serves Armenia; the Georgian embassy is in [[Tel Aviv]]. Israel has supplied humanitarian aid to Georgia a number of times, including drought assistance and aid for earthquake victims.\n\nThe Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI) and American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) both have permanent representatives in Georgia.

Besides speaking Judaeo-Georgian, the Georgian Jews speak the languages of the peoples surrounding them.

In [[Belgium]], most Georgian Jews are member of the [[Jewish community of Antwerp|Antwerp Jewish community]]. The main Georgian synagogue in Belgium is on Isabellalei in Antwerpen, and is led by rabbi Avishalom Kalazan of Yemenite origin. Most of the community is engaged in jewelry trade, with the new generation going into more diverse directions. A second Georgian Jewish synagogue became active around year 2012 under leadership of rabbi Yitzhak Pichkhadze. One notable Georgian Jew in USA is [[Tamir Sapir]], born Temur Sepiashvili, an immigrant taxi driver turned businessman from New York. Another notable Georgian Jew is Dr. Yuri Busi (born Yuri Busiashvili), who was known for being the physician for the actress [[Lucille Ball]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120220,00.html|title=All the World Loved Lucille Ball|author=|date=|website=people.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Dr. Busi developed a successful career as a Cardiologist serving mostly the emigrant Soviet community in Los Angeles.\n\nIn Israel, most Georgian Jews settled near the coast in cities such as [[Lod]], [[Bat Yam]], [[Ashdod]], and [[Holon]]. There are Georgian Jews in [[Jerusalem]] as well, with several prominent synagogues.

Most of the population live in the major cities, like [[Ramadi]] and [[Fallujah]], and almost everyone else  in the region lives within a short distance of the [[Euphrates River]], which snakes from [[Baghdad]] through the Syrian Border.\n\nThe largely [[Sunni]] population in Anbar was a stronghold for the Iraqi resistance during the [[US occupation of Iraq]] (2003\u20132011). After the [[Fallujah killings of April 2003]] and the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2|disbandment of the Iraqi army]] on 25 May 2003, many Sunni locals turned against the American occupiers. The disbandment put hundreds of thousands of Anbaris out of work as many were members of the Army or the party, and viewed its disbanding as an act of contempt towards the Iraqi people.<ref name=\"Al-Anbar Awakening 2009. Pages 8\u20139\">{{harvnb|McWilliams|Wheeler|2009|pp=8\u20139 (Vol. 2)}}</ref>\n\nBy 2004, the province was in full-scale revolt. [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group, and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. Several battles, like [[Battle of Ramadi (2004)]], [[First Battle of Fallujah]] (April 2004), [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] (November\u2013December 2004), [[Second Battle of Ramadi]] (2006), ravaged the region as the Iraqi insurgents struggled against the American occupiers for control of Anbar. During the first four years of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], the Anbar Province was the deadliest province for American service members, claiming approximately one-third of American fatalities.<ref name=\"marines2007\">[http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/Documents/GWOT%202004-2007.pdf Video: Corps Report Episode 54] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915231030/http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/Documents/GWOT%202004-2007.pdf |date=September 15, 2012}}</ref> Part of its significance came from the fact that the western [[Euphrates River|Euphrates River Valley]] served as an important infiltration route for foreign fighters headed to Iraq's heartland from [[Syria]].<ref name=\"marines2007\" />\n\nIn August 2006, several tribes located near Ramadi, led by [[Sheikh]] [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha]], revolted against AQI.

Most of the population live in the major cities, like [[Ramadi]] and [[Fallujah]], and almost everyone else  in the region lives within a short distance of the [[Euphrates River]], which snakes from [[Baghdad]] through the Syrian Border.\n\nThe largely [[Sunni]] population in Anbar was a stronghold for the Iraqi resistance during the [[US occupation of Iraq]] (2003\u20132011). After the [[Fallujah killings of April 2003]] and the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2|disbandment of the Iraqi army]] on 25 May 2003, many Sunni locals turned against the American occupiers. The disbandment put hundreds of thousands of Anbaris out of work as many were members of the Army or the party, and viewed its disbanding as an act of contempt towards the Iraqi people.<ref name=\"Al-Anbar Awakening 2009. Pages 8\u20139\">{{harvnb|McWilliams|Wheeler|2009|pp=8\u20139 (Vol. 2)}}</ref>\n\nBy 2004, the province was in full-scale revolt. [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group, and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. Several battles, like [[Battle of Ramadi (2004)]], [[First Battle of Fallujah]] (April 2004), [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] (November\u2013December 2004), [[Second Battle of Ramadi]] (2006), ravaged the region as the Iraqi insurgents struggled against the American occupiers for control of Anbar. During the first four years of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], the Anbar Province was the deadliest province for American service members, claiming approximately one-third of American fatalities.<ref name=\"marines2007\">[http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/Documents/GWOT%202004-2007.pdf Video: Corps Report Episode 54] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915231030/http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/Documents/GWOT%202004-2007.pdf |date=September 15, 2012}}</ref> Part of its significance came from the fact that the western [[Euphrates River|Euphrates River Valley]] served as an important infiltration route for foreign fighters headed to Iraq's heartland from [[Syria]].<ref name=\"marines2007\" />\n\nIn August 2006, several tribes located near Ramadi, led by [[Sheikh]] [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha]], revolted against AQI.
