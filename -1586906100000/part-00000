In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise. \n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like [[Superman]]; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side. Mr. Nomura was also very good at designing a character like that.|source=\u2014[[Yoshinori Kitase]], ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', October 2005<ref name=\"egm\" />}}\nCloud's character was made to contrast the cast of the previous game, ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', which had no main character.

The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith was also viewed as a novel for the series, and Nojima likened Cloud's relationship to Tifa as one of the childhood friends since nursery school, whereas Aerith was akin to a transfer student arriving mid-term.<ref name=\"8-13\" />\n\nIn early drafts, Cloud would act as an [[alter ego]] for Sephiroth, influenced to believe he was a creation of Sephiroth's will.

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christian]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise. \n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel.

Krypton was exploding, and Kara's parents sent Kara in a spacecraft to Earth after her cousin. Kara was meant to protect her infant cousin Kal-El, but her spacecraft was knocked off course and forced into the [[Phantom Zone]], where it stayed for 24 years. By the time the spacecraft crash landed on Earth, Kal-El had grown up and become [[Superman]].

Krypton was exploding, and Kara's parents sent Kara in a spacecraft to Earth after her cousin. Kara was meant to protect her infant cousin Kal-El, but her spacecraft was knocked off course and forced into the [[Phantom Zone]], where it stayed for 24 years. By the time the spacecraft crash landed on Earth, Kal-El had grown up and become [[Superman]]. The series begins eleven years later when the now 24-year-old Kara is learning to embrace her powers and has adopted the superheroic alias \"Supergirl\".<ref name=\"DeadlineSep2014\" >{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/09/supergirl-tv-series-cbs-dc-greg-berlati-ali-adler-836682/ |title='Supergirl' Drama From Greg Berlanti & Ali Adler Lands CBS Series Commitment |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=September 19, 2014 |accessdate=September 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919200127/http://deadline.com/2014/09/supergirl-tv-series-cbs-dc-greg-berlati-ali-adler-836682/ |archive-date=September 19, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP:TVPLOT. -->\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 1)|first season]], Kara is forced to reveal her powers, and becomes [[National City (DC Comics)|National City]]'s protector.<ref name=\"TVLineOct2014\">{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2014/10/30/supergirl-tv-show-cbs-casting/ |title=Meet CBS's Supergirl (''and'' Her Sister), Get Scoop on Kara's Big Entrance |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030214639/http://tvline.com/2014/10/30/supergirl-tv-show-cbs-casting/ |archive-date=October 30, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kara discovers that hundreds of the criminals her mother imprisoned are hiding on Earth, including her aunt Astra and Astra's husband [[Non (comics)|Non]].

At the same time, Kara befriends Lillian's stepdaughter [[Lena Luthor]], the new CEO of [[LexCorp|LuthorCorp]], and struggles with romantic feelings for recent Earth arrival [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], a princely survivor from Krypton's neighboring planet [[Daxam]] whose parents wish to reclaim him. James becomes the masked streetfighting vigilante [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]]; Alex begins dating [[Maggie Sawyer]]; and J'onn befriends a younger Martian, [[Miss Martian|M'gann]], from the [[White Martian]] race that killed his people.\n\nIn the [[Supergirl (season 3)|third season]], Kara struggles with the loss of Mon-El after he is forced to leave Earth. When Mon-El returns, he reveals that he has time-traveled to the 31st century and founded the [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legion]], alongside marrying [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ardeen]]. J'onn discovers his father M'yrnn J'onzz is alive and Alex deals with her heartbreak after breaking up with Maggie.

[[Agent Liberty|Ben Lockwood]], a former college professor who suffered a series of personal tragedies at the hands of extraterrestrials, forms a human-first group called the Children of Liberty to end all aliens. Meanwhile, in the nation of [[Kasnia]], a clone of Kara dubbed \"Red Daughter\" is trained by its military to fight Supergirl at Lex's request. Kara and Alex rival with the DEO's new addition, Col. Lauren Haley, who was sent to monitor the DEO's progress under Alex's direction. Col.
