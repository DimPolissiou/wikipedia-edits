Get the ball to his feet or head and he can finish.\" Although normally a forward, he has also been deployed out of position in a more defensive role on occasion, often playing as a right\u2013sided [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]] during his time with Israeli club Hapoel Haifa FC, due to injuries to other members of the squad in that position.<ref name=\"stability\">{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/toronto-fcs-tosaint-ricketts-grateful-for-mls-stability-after-european-turmoil |title=Toronto FC's Tosaint Ricketts grateful for MLS stability after European turmoil |work=The National Post |last1=Davidson |first1=Neil |date=18 November 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thescore.com/mls/news/1748885 |title=How nomadic path positioned Tosaint Ricketts to help Canada's next generation |publisher=The Score |last1=Chandler |first1=Michael J. |date=23 April 2019 |accessdate=19 March 2020 }}</ref> He has also drawn praise in the media for his energy, presence in the air, and leadership, as well as his goalscoring rate,<ref name=\"athletic\">{{cite web |url=https://theathletic.com/156211/2017/11/15/what-makes-tosaint-ricketts-a-dangerous-scoring-threat-a-tfc-coach-explains/ |title=What makes Tosaint Ricketts a dangerous scoring threat?

{"title_page": "Multiple encryption", "text_new": "'''Multiple encryption''' is the process of [[encryption|encrypting]] an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as '''cascade encryption''', '''cascade ciphering''', '''multiple encryption''', and '''superencipherment'''. '''Superencryption''' refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.\n\nSome cryptographers, like Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University, say multiple encryption addresses a problem that mostly doesn\u2019t exist: ''Modern ciphers rarely get broken... You\u2019re far more likely to get hit by malware or an implementation bug than you are to suffer a catastrophic attack on AES''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Green |first=Matthew |title=Multiple Encryption |url=https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/02/02/multiple-encryption/ |date=February 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Independent keys==\nPicking any two [[cipher]]s, if the [[key (cryptography)|key]] used is the same for both, the second cipher could possibly undo the first cipher, partly or entirely. This is true of ciphers where the [[decryption]] process is exactly the same as the encryption process&mdash;the second cipher would completely undo the first. If an attacker were to recover the key through [[cryptanalysis]] of the first encryption layer, the attacker could possibly decrypt all the remaining layers, assuming the same key is used for all layers.\n\nTo prevent that risk, one can use keys that are [[statistical independence|statistically independent]] for each layer (e.g. independent [[Random number generator|RNGs]]).\n\n==Importance of the first layer==\nWith the exception of the [[one-time pad]], no cipher has been theoretically proven to be unbreakable.\nFurthermore, some recurring properties may be found in the [[ciphertext]]s generated by the first cipher. Since those ciphertexts are the plaintexts used by the second cipher, the second cipher may be rendered vulnerable to attacks based on known plaintext properties (see references below).\n\nThis is the case when the first layer is a program P that always adds the same string S of characters at the beginning (or end) of all ciphertexts (commonly known as a [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]]). When found in a file, the string S allows an [[Kernel (operating system)|operating system]] to know that the program P has to be launched in order to decrypt the file. This string should be removed before adding a second layer.\n\nTo prevent this kind of attack, one can use the method provided by [[Bruce Schneier]] in the references below: generate a random pad of the same size of the plaintext, then [[XOR]] the plaintext with the pad, resulting in a first ciphertext. Encrypt the pad and the first ciphertext with a different cipher and a different key, resulting in 2 more ciphertexts. [[Concatenate]] the last 2 ciphertexts in order to build the final ciphertext. A cryptanalyst must break both ciphers to get any information.  This will, however, have the drawback of making the ciphertext twice as long as the original plaintext.\n\nNote, however, that a weak first cipher may merely make a second cipher that is vulnerable to a [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintext attack]] also vulnerable to a [[Known-plaintext attack|known plaintext attack]]. However, a [[block cipher]] must not be vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack to be considered secure. Therefore, the second cipher described above is not secure under that definition, either. Consequently, both ciphers still need to be broken. The attack illustrates why strong assumptions are made about secure block ciphers and ciphers that are even partially broken should never be used.\n\n==The Rule of Two==\n\nThe '''Rule of Two''' is a data security principle from the [[National Security Agency|NSA's]] Commercial Solutions for Classified Program (CSfC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/csfc_program/ |title=Commercial Solutions for Classified Program |publisher=US National Security Agency |access-date=24 December 2015 |quote=}}</ref> It specifies two completely independent layers of cryptography to protect data. For example, data could be protected by both hardware encryption at its lowest level and software encryption at the application layer.\n\nThe importance of vendor and/or model diversity between the layers of components centers around removing the possibility that the manufacturers or models will share a vulnerability. This way if one components is compromised there is still an entire layer of encryption protecting the information at rest or in transit. The CSfC Program offers solutions to achieve diversity in two ways. \"The first is to implement each layer using components produced by different manufacturers. The second is to use components from the same manufacturer, where that\nmanufacturer has provided NSA with sufficient evidence that the implementations of the two components are independent of one another.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/capability-packages/MACPv2_1.pdf/ |title=Mobile Access Capability Package  |publisher=US National Security Agency |access-date=28 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe principle is practiced in the NSA's secure mobile phone called Fishbowl.<ref name=\":0\" /> The phones use two layers of encryption protocols, [[IPsec]] and [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]] (SRTP), to protect voice communications.\n\n== Example of Multiple Encryption==\n\nThe figure shows from inside to outside the process of how the encrypted capsule is formed in the context of Echo Protocol, used by the Software Application GoldBug Messenger.<ref>http://goldbug.sf.net</ref> GoldBug has implemented a hybrid system for authenticity and confidentiality.<ref name=\":0\">Adams, David / Maier, Ann-Kathrin (2016): BIG SEVEN Study, open source crypto-messengers to be compared - or: Comprehensive Confidentiality Review & Audit of GoldBug, Encrypting E-Mail-Client & Secure Instant Messenger, Descriptions, tests and analysis reviews of 20 functions of the application GoldBug based on the essential fields and methods of evaluation of the 8 major international audit manuals for IT security investigations including 38 figures and 87 tables., URL: <nowiki>https://sf.net/projects/goldbug/files/bigseven-crypto-audit.pdf</nowiki> - English / German Language, Version 1.1, 305 pages, June 2016 (ISBN: DNB 110368003X - 2016B14779)</ref>\n\n[[File:Figure 02 GoldBug \u2013 Encrypted Message Format within the Echo- Protocol.png|thumb|500px]]\n\n'''<u>First layer of the encryption:</u>''' \nThe ciphertext of the original readable message is hashed, and subsequently the symmetric keys are encrypted via the asymmetric key - e.g. deploying the algorithm RSA.\nIn an intermediate step the ciphertext, and the hash digest of the ciphertext are combined into a capsule, and packed together.\nIt follows the approach: [[w:Authenticated encryption#Encrypt-then-MAC|Encrypt-then-MAC]].

Since those ciphertexts are the plaintexts used by the second cipher, the second cipher may be rendered vulnerable to attacks based on known plaintext properties (see references below).\n\nThis is the case when the first layer is a program P that always adds the same string S of characters at the beginning (or end) of all ciphertexts (commonly known as a [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]]). When found in a file, the string S allows an [[Kernel (operating system)|operating system]] to know that the program P has to be launched in order to decrypt the file. This string should be removed before adding a second layer.\n\nTo prevent this kind of attack, one can use the method provided by [[Bruce Schneier]] in the references below: generate a random pad of the same size of the plaintext, then [[XOR]] the plaintext with the pad, resulting in a first ciphertext. Encrypt the pad and the first ciphertext with a different cipher and a different key, resulting in 2 more ciphertexts. [[Concatenate]] the last 2 ciphertexts in order to build the final ciphertext. A cryptanalyst must break both ciphers to get any information.  This will, however, have the drawback of making the ciphertext twice as long as the original plaintext.\n\nNote, however, that a weak first cipher may merely make a second cipher that is vulnerable to a [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintext attack]] also vulnerable to a [[Known-plaintext attack|known plaintext attack]]. However, a [[block cipher]] must not be vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack to be considered secure. Therefore, the second cipher described above is not secure under that definition, either. Consequently, both ciphers still need to be broken. The attack illustrates why strong assumptions are made about secure block ciphers and ciphers that are even partially broken should never be used.\n\n==The Rule of Two==\n\nThe '''Rule of Two''' is a data security principle from the [[National Security Agency|NSA's]] Commercial Solutions for Classified Program (CSfC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/csfc_program/ |title=Commercial Solutions for Classified Program |publisher=US National Security Agency |access-date=24 December 2015 |quote=}}</ref> It specifies two completely independent layers of cryptography to protect data. For example, data could be protected by both hardware encryption at its lowest level and software encryption at the application layer.\n\nThe importance of vendor and/or model diversity between the layers of components centers around removing the possibility that the manufacturers or models will share a vulnerability. This way if one components is compromised there is still an entire layer of encryption protecting the information at rest or in transit. The CSfC Program offers solutions to achieve diversity in two ways. \"The first is to implement each layer using components produced by different manufacturers. The second is to use components from the same manufacturer, where that\nmanufacturer has provided NSA with sufficient evidence that the implementations of the two components are independent of one another.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/capability-packages/MACPv2_1.pdf/ |title=Mobile Access Capability Package  |publisher=US National Security Agency |access-date=28 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe principle is practiced in the NSA's secure mobile phone called Fishbowl.<ref name=\":0\" /> The phones use two layers of encryption protocols, [[IPsec]] and [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol]] (SRTP), to protect voice communications.\n\n== Example of Multiple Encryption==\n\nThe figure shows from inside to outside the process of how the encrypted capsule is formed in the context of Echo Protocol, used by the Software Application GoldBug Messenger.<ref>http://goldbug.sf.net</ref> GoldBug has implemented a hybrid system for authenticity and confidentiality.<ref name=\":0\">Adams, David / Maier, Ann-Kathrin (2016): BIG SEVEN Study, open source crypto-messengers to be compared - or: Comprehensive Confidentiality Review & Audit of GoldBug, Encrypting E-Mail-Client & Secure Instant Messenger, Descriptions, tests and analysis reviews of 20 functions of the application GoldBug based on the essential fields and methods of evaluation of the 8 major international audit manuals for IT security investigations including 38 figures and 87 tables., URL: <nowiki>https://sf.net/projects/goldbug/files/bigseven-crypto-audit.pdf</nowiki> - English / German Language, Version 1.1, 305 pages, June 2016 (ISBN: DNB 110368003X - 2016B14779)</ref>\n\n[[File:Figure 02 GoldBug \u2013 Encrypted Message Format within the Echo- Protocol.png|thumb|500px]]\n\n'''<u>First layer of the encryption:</u>''' \nThe ciphertext of the original readable message is hashed, and subsequently the symmetric keys are encrypted via the asymmetric key - e.g. deploying the algorithm RSA.\nIn an intermediate step the ciphertext, and the hash digest of the ciphertext are combined into a capsule, and packed together.\nIt follows the approach: [[w:Authenticated encryption#Encrypt-then-MAC|Encrypt-then-MAC]].
