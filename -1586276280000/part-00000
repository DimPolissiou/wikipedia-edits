This is a typical presentation and restoring mobility in the rearfoot in the transverse plane by distracting the calcaneus and oscillating it in abduction (also described as external rotation) followed by distraction and medial rotation of the midefoot most oftentimes restores cuboid mobility without having to directly mobilize the cuboid. A less common presentation is the exact opposite pattern of cuboid restriction in which mobilization such as with the \"cuboid whip\" is appropriate.          =\n| risks           =\n| diagnosis       =\n| differential    =\n| prevention      =\n| treatment       =\n| medication      =\n| prognosis       =\n| frequency       =\n| deaths          =\n}}\n'''Cuboid syndrome''' or '''cuboid subluxation''' describes a condition that results from subtle injury to the [[calcaneocuboid articulation|calcaneocuboid joint]]<ref name=\"Examination\">{{cite journal |last1=Durall |first1=CJ|title=Examination and treatment of cuboid syndrome: a literature review|journal=Sports Health|volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=514\u2013519 |date=November 2011|pmid=23016051|pmc= 3445231|doi=10.1177/1941738111405965 }}</ref> and [[ligaments]] in the vicinity of the [[cuboid bone]], one of seven [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] bones of the human [[foot]].\n\nThis condition often manifests in the form of lateral (little toe side) foot pain and sometimes general foot weakness.

{"title_page": "History of Guinea", "text_new": "The modern state of [[Guinea]] did not come into existence until 1958, but the history of the area stretches back well before [[Scramble for Africa|European colonization]]. Its current boundaries were determined during the colonial period by the [[Berlin Conference]] (1884\u20131885) and the French, who ruled Guinea until 1958...........\n\n==West African empires==\nWhat is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major [[West Africa]]n empires. The [[Ghana Empire]] is believed to be the earliest of these which grew on trade but contracted and ultimately fell due to the hostile influence of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region.\n\nThe [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the Islamic [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K\u00e9\u00efta]] defeated the Sosso ruler, [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9|Sumanguru Kant\u00e9]] at the semi-historical [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.\n\nThe most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], expanding its power from about 1460, and eventually surpassing the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just 3 years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.\n\n==Kingdoms in Guinea==\nAfter the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea.\n\n===Futa Jallon===\n{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon}}\n[[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers.\n\n===Wassoulou Empire===\n{{Main|Wassoulou Empire}}\nThe Wassoulou empire was a short-lived (1878\u20131898) empire, led by [[Samory Tour\u00e9]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink\u00e9]] area of what is now upper [[Guinea]] and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.\n\n==Colonial era==\n[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|Map of [[French West Africa]] circa 1913]]\nThe [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European colonialists in the 16th century. Slavery had always been part of everyday life but the scale increased as slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].\n\nGuinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour\u00e9]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink\u00e9 descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.\n\nFrance negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.\n\n==Independence (1958)==\nIn 1958 the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] and immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958.\n\nThe other French colonies chose the former but Guinea \u2014 under the leadership of [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on October 2, 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 as president.\n\n===S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's rule (1958\u20131984)===\n[[File:DF-SC-83-08641.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] arrives for a visit to Washington D.C., June 1982.]]\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was hostile to Tour\u00e9, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. Following France's withdrawal, Guinea quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted socialist policies. This alliance was short lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism.  Nevertheless, President John F. Kennedy and his Peace Corps director [[Sargent Shriver]] tried even harder than the Kremlin's [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington.<ref>Philip E. Muehlenbeck, \"Kennedy and Toure: A success in personal diplomacy.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 19.1 (2008): 69-95. [http://www.academia.edu/download/41358717/Diplomacy___Statecraft.pdf  online]</ref>  Guinea relied more and more on aid and investment from the U.S. Even the relationship with France improved, after the election of [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.\n\nBy 1960, Tour\u00e9 had declared the PDG the only legal party.  For the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour\u00e9 was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.  Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour\u00e9 quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning hundreds, and stifling free press.\n\nAt the same time, the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and broke ties with French government and companies. Vacillating between support for the [[Soviet Union]] and (by the late 1970s) the United States, Guinea's economic situation became as unpredictable as its diplomatic line. Alleging plots and conspiracies against him at home and abroad, Tour\u00e9's regime targeted real and imagined opponents, driving thousands of political opponents into exile.\n\nIn 1970, Portuguese forces, from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]], staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid into Guinea with the support of exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among other goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], a guerilla movement operating inside Portuguese Guinea.<ref>\n\"Mr Sekou Tour\u00e9, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...\"[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308154755/http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13213487 |date=2009-03-08 }}, [[The Economist]] (Nov 22nd 1980)\n</ref> After several days of fierce fighting, the Portuguese forces retreated without achieving most of their goals. The regime of S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 increased the number of internal arrests and executions.\n\nThe [[Guinean Market Women's Revolt]] in 1977 resulted in the regime's softening of economic restrictions and began a turn away from the radical socialism previously practiced by the government.\n\nS\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 died on March 26, 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections.\n\n===Lansana Cont\u00e9's rule (1984\u20132008)===\nThe PDG was due to elect a new leader on April 3, 1984.  Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president.  However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and [[Diarra Traor\u00e9]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Cont\u00e9 assumed the role of president, with Traor\u00e9 serving as prime minister until December.\n\nCont\u00e9 immediately denounced the previous regime's record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].\n\nIn 1992, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party \u2013 the [[Party of Unity and Progress]] \u2013 won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont\u00e9's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001 the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond\u00e9]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.\n\nIn 2001 Cont\u00e9 organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Cont\u00e9 survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a \"tired dictator\" <ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archive-date=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead }} \n</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

Its current boundaries were determined during the colonial period by the [[Berlin Conference]] (1884\u20131885) and the French, who ruled Guinea until 1958.\n\n==West African empires==\nWhat is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major [[West Africa]]n empires. The [[Ghana Empire]] is believed to be the earliest of these which grew on trade but contracted and ultimately fell due to the hostile influence of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region.\n\nThe [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the Islamic [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K\u00e9\u00efta]] defeated the Sosso ruler, [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9|Sumanguru Kant\u00e9]] at the semi-historical [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.\n\nThe most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], expanding its power from about 1460, and eventually surpassing the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just 3 years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.\n\n==Kingdoms in Guinea==\nAfter the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea.\n\n===Futa Jallon===\n{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon}}\n[[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers.\n\n===Wassoulou Empire===\n{{Main|Wassoulou Empire}}\nThe Wassoulou empire was a short-lived (1878\u20131898) empire, led by [[Samory Tour\u00e9]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink\u00e9]] area of what is now upper [[Guinea]] and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.\n\n==Colonial era==\n[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|Map of [[French West Africa]] circa 1913]]\nThe [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European colonialists in the 16th century. Slavery had always been part of everyday life but the scale increased as slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].\n\nGuinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour\u00e9]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink\u00e9 descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.\n\nFrance negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.\n\n==Independence (1958)==\nIn 1958 the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] and immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958.\n\nThe other French colonies chose the former but Guinea \u2014 under the leadership of [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on October 2, 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 as president.\n\n===S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's rule (1958\u20131984)===\n[[File:DF-SC-83-08641.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] arrives for a visit to Washington D.C., June 1982.]]\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was hostile to Tour\u00e9, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. Following France's withdrawal, Guinea quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted socialist policies. This alliance was short lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism.  Nevertheless, President John F. Kennedy and his Peace Corps director [[Sargent Shriver]] tried even harder than the Kremlin's [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington.<ref>Philip E. Muehlenbeck, \"Kennedy and Toure: A success in personal diplomacy.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 19.1 (2008): 69-95. [http://www.academia.edu/download/41358717/Diplomacy___Statecraft.pdf  online]</ref>  Guinea relied more and more on aid and investment from the U.S. Even the relationship with France improved, after the election of [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.\n\nBy 1960, Tour\u00e9 had declared the PDG the only legal party.  For the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour\u00e9 was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.  Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour\u00e9 quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning hundreds, and stifling free press.\n\nAt the same time, the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and broke ties with French government and companies. Vacillating between support for the [[Soviet Union]] and (by the late 1970s) the United States, Guinea's economic situation became as unpredictable as its diplomatic line. Alleging plots and conspiracies against him at home and abroad, Tour\u00e9's regime targeted real and imagined opponents, driving thousands of political opponents into exile.\n\nIn 1970, Portuguese forces, from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]], staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid into Guinea with the support of exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among other goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], a guerilla movement operating inside Portuguese Guinea.<ref>\n\"Mr Sekou Tour\u00e9, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...\"[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308154755/http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13213487 |date=2009-03-08 }}, [[The Economist]] (Nov 22nd 1980)\n</ref> After several days of fierce fighting, the Portuguese forces retreated without achieving most of their goals. The regime of S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 increased the number of internal arrests and executions.\n\nThe [[Guinean Market Women's Revolt]] in 1977 resulted in the regime's softening of economic restrictions and began a turn away from the radical socialism previously practiced by the government.\n\nS\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 died on March 26, 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections.\n\n===Lansana Cont\u00e9's rule (1984\u20132008)===\nThe PDG was due to elect a new leader on April 3, 1984.  Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president.  However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and [[Diarra Traor\u00e9]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Cont\u00e9 assumed the role of president, with Traor\u00e9 serving as prime minister until December.\n\nCont\u00e9 immediately denounced the previous regime's record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].\n\nIn 1992, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party \u2013 the [[Party of Unity and Progress]] \u2013 won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont\u00e9's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001 the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond\u00e9]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.\n\nIn 2001 Cont\u00e9 organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Cont\u00e9 survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a \"tired dictator\" <ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archive-date=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead }} \n</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

The paradox in this article considers the consequences of an experiment where one of the objects to release is electrically charged.]]\nIt is a standard result from [[Maxwell's equations]] of [[classical electrodynamics]] that an accelerated charge radiates. That is, it produces an electric field that falls off as <math>1/r</math> in addition to its rest-frame <math>1/r^2</math> Coulomb field. This radiation electric field has an accompanying magnetic field, and the whole oscillating electromagnetic radiation field propagates independently of the accelerated charge, carrying away momentum and energy. The energy in the radiation is provided by the work that accelerates the charge.\n\nThe theory of general relativity is built on the [[equivalence principle]] of gravitation and inertia. This principle states that it is impossible to distinguish through any local measurement whether one is in a gravitational field or being accelerated. An elevator out in deep space, far from any planet, could mimic a gravitational field to its occupants if it could be accelerated continuously \"upward\". Whether the acceleration is from motion or from gravity makes no difference in the laws of physics. One can also understand it in terms of the equivalence of so-called [[mass#Universal gravitational mass|gravitational mass]] and [[mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]]. The mass in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] (gravitational mass) is the same as the mass in [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] (inertial mass). They cancel out when equated, with [[mass#Galilean free fall|the result]] discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1638, that all bodies fall at the same rate in a gravitational field, independent of their mass. A famous demonstration of this principle was performed on the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo 15]] mission, when a hammer and a feather were dropped at the same time and struck the surface at the same time.\n\nClosely tied in with this equivalence is the fact that gravity vanishes in free fall. For objects falling in an elevator whose cable is cut, all gravitational forces vanish, and things begin to look like the free-floating absence of forces one sees in videos from the [[International Space Station]]. It is a linchpin of general relativity that everything must fall together in free fall. Just as with acceleration versus gravity, no experiment should be able to distinguish the effects of free fall in a gravitational field, and being out in deep space far from any forces.\n\n==Statement of the paradox==\nPutting together these two basic facts of general relativity and electrodynamics, we seem to encounter a paradox. For if we dropped a neutral particle and a charged particle together in a gravitational field, the charged particle should begin to radiate as it is accelerated under gravity, thereby losing energy and slowing relative to the neutral particle. Then a free-falling observer could distinguish free fall from the true absence of forces, because a charged particle in a free-falling laboratory would begin to be pulled upward relative to the neutral parts of the laboratory, even though no obvious electric fields were present.\n\nEquivalently, we can think about a charged particle at rest in a laboratory on the surface of the Earth. In order to be at rest, it must be supported by something which exerts an upward force on it. This system is equivalent to being in outer space accelerated constantly upward at 1&nbsp;''g'', and we know that a charged particle accelerated upward at 1&nbsp;''g'' would radiate, why don't we see radiation from charged particles at rest in the laboratory? It would seem that we could distinguish between a gravitational field and acceleration, because an electric charge apparently only radiates when it is being accelerated through motion, but not through gravitation.\n\n==Resolution by Rohrlich==\n{{See also|Rindler coordinates}}\nThe resolution of this paradox, like the [[twin paradox]] and [[ladder paradox]], comes through appropriate care in distinguishing [[frames of reference]]. This section follows the analysis of [[Fritz Rohrlich]] (1965),<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Rohrlich|1964|loc=sec. 8-3}}</ref> who shows that a charged particle and a neutral particle fall equally fast in a gravitational field.

The frame could be free fall under gravity, or far in space away from any forces. The surface of the Earth is ''not'' an inertial frame, as it is being constantly accelerated. We know that the surface of the Earth is not an inertial frame because an object at rest there may not remain at rest\u2014objects at rest fall to the ground when released. Gravity is a non-local fictitious \u201cforce\u201d within the Earth's surface frame, just like centrifugal \u201cforce\u201d.  So we cannot naively formulate expectations based on Maxwell's equations in this frame. It is remarkable that we now understand the special-relativistic Maxwell equations do not hold, strictly speaking, on the surface of the Earth, even though they were discovered in electrical and magnetic experiments conducted in laboratories on the surface of the Earth. (This is similar to how the concept of mechanics in an inertial frame is not applicable to the surface of the Earth even disregarding gravity due to its rotation - cf. e.g. [[Foucault pendulum]], yet they were originally found from considering ground experiments and intuitions.) Nevertheless, in this case, we cannot apply Maxwell's equations to the description of a falling charge relative to a \"supported\", non-inertial observer.\n\nMaxwell's equations can be applied relative to an observer in free fall, because free-fall is an inertial frame. So the starting point of considerations is to work in the free-fall frame in a gravitational field\u2014a \"falling\" observer. In the free-fall frame, Maxwell's equations have their usual, flat-spacetime form for the falling observer. In this frame, the electric and magnetic fields of the charge are simple: the falling electric field is just the Coulomb field of a charge at rest, and the magnetic field is zero. As an aside, note that we are building in the equivalence principle from the start, including the assumption that a charged particle falls equally as fast as a neutral particle.\n\nThe fields measured by an observer supported on the surface of the Earth are different. Given the electric and magnetic fields in the falling frame, we have to transform those fields into the frame of the supported observer. This manipulation is ''not'' a Lorentz transformation, because the two frames have a relative acceleration. Instead, the machinery of [[general relativity]] must be used.\n\nIn this case the gravitational field is fictitious because it can be \"transformed away\" by appropriate choice of coordinate system in the falling frame. Unlike the total gravitational field of the Earth, here we are assuming that spacetime is locally flat, so that the [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]] vanishes. Equivalently, the lines of gravitational acceleration are everywhere parallel, with no convergences measurable in the laboratory. Then the most general static, flat-space, cylindrical [[metric tensor|metric]] and line element can be written:\n:<math>\nc^2 d\\tau^2 = u^2(z)c^2dt^2 - \\left( \\frac{c^2}{g} \\frac{du}{dz} \\right)^2 dz^2 - dx^2 - dy^2,\n</math>\nwhere <math>c</math> is the speed of light, <math>\\tau</math> is proper time, <math>x, y, z, t</math> are the usual coordinates of space and time, <math>g</math> is the acceleration of the gravitational field, and <math>u(z)</math> is an arbitrary function of the coordinate but must approach the observed Newtonian value of <math>1 + gz/c^2</math>. This formula is the metric for the gravitational field measured by the supported observer.\n\nMeanwhile, the metric in the frame of the falling observer is simply the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]:\n:<math>\nc^2 d\\tau^2 = c^2 dt'^2 - dz'^2 - dx'^2 - dy'^2.\n</math>\n\nFrom these two metrics Rohrlich constructs the coordinate transformation between them:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx' &= x, \\\\\ny' &= y, \\\\\n\\frac{g}{c^2} (z' - z_0') &= u(z) \\cosh g(t - t_0) - 1,\\\\\n\\frac{g}{c} (t' - t_0') &= u(z) \\sinh g(t - t_0).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWhen this coordinate transformation is applied to the electric and magnetic fields of the charge in the rest frame, it is found to be ''radiating''. Rohrlich emphasizes that this charge remains at rest in its free-fall frame, just as a neutral particle would. Furthermore, the radiation rate for this situation is Lorentz-invariant, but it is not invariant under the coordinate transformation above because it is not a Lorentz transformation.\n\nWhat about a supported charge, then? Does it not radiate due to the equivalence principle? To answer this question, start again in the falling frame.\n\nAs observed from the freefalling frame, the supported charge appears to be accelerated uniformly upward. The case of constant acceleration of a charge is treated by Rohrlich.<ref name=\":1\">{{Harvnb|Rohrlich|1964|loc=sec. 5-3}}</ref> He finds a charge <math>e</math> uniformly accelerated at rate <math>g</math> has a radiation rate given by the Lorentz invariant:\n\n:<math>\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{e^2}{c^3} g^2.\n</math>\n\nThe corresponding electric and magnetic fields of an accelerated charge are also given in Rohrlich.<ref name=\":1\" /> To find the fields of the charge in the supporting frame, the fields of the uniformly accelerated charge are transformed according to the coordinate transformation previously given. When that is done, one finds ''no radiation'' in the supporting frame from a supported charge, because the magnetic field is zero in this frame. Rohrlich does note that the gravitational field slightly distorts the Coulomb field of the supported charge, but too small to be observable. So although the Coulomb law was discovered in a supporting frame, general relativity tells us that the field of such a charge is not precisely <math>1/r^2</math>.\n\n=== Where is the radiation? ===\nThe radiation from the supported charge viewed in the freefalling frame (or vice versa) is something of a curiosity: where does it go?

This formula is the metric for the gravitational field measured by the supported observer.\n\nMeanwhile, the metric in the frame of the falling observer is simply the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]:\n:<math>\nc^2 d\\tau^2 = c^2 dt'^2 - dz'^2 - dx'^2 - dy'^2.\n</math>\n\nFrom these two metrics Rohrlich constructs the coordinate transformation between them:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx' &= x, \\\\\ny' &= y, \\\\\n\\frac{g}{c^2} (z' - z_0') &= u(z) \\cosh g(t - t_0) - 1,\\\\\n\\frac{g}{c} (t' - t_0') &= u(z) \\sinh g(t - t_0).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWhen this coordinate transformation is applied to the electric and magnetic fields of the charge in the rest frame, it is found to be ''radiating''. Rohrlich emphasizes that this charge remains at rest in its free-fall frame, just as a neutral particle would. Furthermore, the radiation rate for this situation is Lorentz-invariant, but it is not invariant under the coordinate transformation above because it is not a Lorentz transformation.\n\nWhat about a supported charge, then? Does it not radiate due to the equivalence principle? To answer this question, start again in the falling frame.\n\nAs observed from the freefalling frame, the supported charge appears to be accelerated uniformly upward. The case of constant acceleration of a charge is treated by Rohrlich.<ref name=\":1\">{{Harvnb|Rohrlich|1964|loc=sec. 5-3}}</ref> He finds a charge <math>e</math> uniformly accelerated at rate <math>g</math> has a radiation rate given by the Lorentz invariant:\n\n:<math>\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{e^2}{c^3} g^2.\n</math>\n\nThe corresponding electric and magnetic fields of an accelerated charge are also given in Rohrlich.<ref name=\":1\" /> To find the fields of the charge in the supporting frame, the fields of the uniformly accelerated charge are transformed according to the coordinate transformation previously given. When that is done, one finds ''no radiation'' in the supporting frame from a supported charge, because the magnetic field is zero in this frame. Rohrlich does note that the gravitational field slightly distorts the Coulomb field of the supported charge, but too small to be observable. So although the Coulomb law was discovered in a supporting frame, general relativity tells us that the field of such a charge is not precisely <math>1/r^2</math>.\n\n=== Where is the radiation? ===\nThe radiation from the supported charge viewed in the freefalling frame (or vice versa) is something of a curiosity: where does it go?

In effect, a uniformly accelerated observer has an event horizon, and there are regions of spacetime inaccessible to this observer.
