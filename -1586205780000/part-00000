This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]], giving rise to the [[expansionism|expansionist]] philosophy known as \"[[Manifest Destiny]]\".\n\nA \"[[frontier]]\" is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement. Leading theorist [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] went deeper, arguing that the frontier was the defining process of American civilization: \"The frontier,\" he asserted, \"promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people.\" He theorized it was a process of development: \"This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward...furnish[es] the forces dominating American character.\"<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History, in Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) pp. 1\u201338. [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/afp/turner.htm online]</ref> Turner's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians (and critics) to explore multiple individual American frontiers, but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Texas]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\nIn 19th- and early 20th-century media, enormous popular attention was focused on the [[Western United States]] in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, from the 1850s to the 1910s, a period sometimes called the '''Old West''' or the '''Wild West'''. Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect. This eventually inspired the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre of film, which spilled over into [[television show]]s, [[Western fiction|novels]], [[comic books]], and [[video game]]s, as well as children's toys and costumes.\n\nAs defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states.\" They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Robert V. | last=Hine | author2=John Mack Faragher | title=The American West: A New Interpretive History | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | year=2000 | page=[https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 10] | isbn=978-0300078350 | url=https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 }}</ref>  Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans: \"The existence of an area of\nfree land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.\"<ref>Quoted in William Cronon,  \"Revisiting the vanishing frontier: The legacy of Frederick Jackson Turner.\" ''Western Historical Quarterly'' 18.2 (1987): 157\u2013176, at p. 157.</ref> Through treaties with foreign nations and [[Native Americans in the United States|native tribes]], political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, the building of farms, ranches, and towns, the marking of trails and digging of mines, and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Turner, in his \"[[Frontier Thesis]]\" (1893), theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as [[individualism]], self-reliance, and even violence.\n\nAs the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took a firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike. In David Murdoch's view, [[American exceptionalism|America is exceptional]] in choosing its iconic self-image: \"No other nation has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America's creation of the West.\"<ref name=\"Murdoch\">{{cite book | first=David | last=Murdoch | title=The American West: The Invention of a Myth | publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] | isbn= 978-0874173697 | year = 2001| page= vii | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3dFIhTAVvNQC&pg=PR7}}</ref> I know your cheating on online classes!

The American frontier began when [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia, was settled by the English in 1607. In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic coast, until about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier'' (5th ed. 2001) ch.&nbsp;1\u20137</ref> English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these [[habitants]] settled in villages along the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and midwest region they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]]<ref>Clarence Walworth Alvord, ''The Illinois Country 1673\u20131818'' (1918)</ref> as well as a larger settlement around [[New Orleans]]. Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning [[patroon]]s who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.<ref>Sung Bok Kim, ''Landlord and Tenant in Colonial New York: Manorial Society, 1664\u20131775'' (1987)</ref>\n\nAreas in the north that were in the frontier stage by 1700 generally had poor transportation facilities, so the opportunity for commercial agriculture was low. These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture, and as a result, by the 1760s these societies were highly egalitarian, as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main:\n{{quote|The typical frontier society, therefore, was one in which class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and there were a number of landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.<ref>Jackson Turner Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;11.</ref>}}\n\nIn the South, frontier areas that lacked transportation, such as the Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However, frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought up the good land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer \"frontier\". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.<ref>Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;44\u201346.</ref>\n{{anchor|The Near West|Near West|near west}}<!-- redirect target - -->\n\n=== From British peasants to American farmers ===\n\nThe seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers, and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farmland.<ref>Allan Kulikoff, ''From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers'' (2000)</ref> Unlike Britain, where a small number of landlords owned most of the good land, ownership in America was cheap, easy and widespread.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|peace treaty of 1763]], France lost practically everything, as the lands west of the Mississippi river, in addition to Florida and New Orleans, went to Spain. Otherwise, lands east of the Mississippi River and what is now Canada went to Britain.\n\n=== Steady migration to frontier lands ===\n\nRegardless of wars Americans were moving across the Appalachians into western Pennsylvania, what is now West Virginia, and areas of the [[Ohio Country]], Kentucky, and Tennessee.

By the 1830s, however, the West was filling up with squatters who had no legal deed, although they may have paid money to previous settlers. The [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] favored the squatters by promising rapid access to cheap land. By contrast, [[Henry Clay]] was alarmed at the \"lawless rabble\" heading West who were undermining the utopian concept of a law-abiding, stable middle-class republican community. Rich southerners, meanwhile, looked for opportunities to buy high-quality land to set up slave plantations.

They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:\n{{quote|The United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this be a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain.

Letters from early settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased migration to the West, helped scattered families stay in touch and provide neutral help, assisted entrepreneurs to find business opportunities, and made possible regular commercial relationships between merchants and the West and wholesalers and factories back east. The postal service likewise assisted the Army in expanding control over the vast western territories. The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail, such as the ''New York Weekly Tribune'', facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The postal service helped to integrate already established areas with the frontier, creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.<ref>William H.

He identified these layers as multiple \"frontiers\" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.<ref>Mark Wyman, '' The Wisconsin Frontier'' (2009) pp.&nbsp;182, 293\u201394</ref>\n\nFrederick Jackson Turner grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant.\"<ref>Merle Curti, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959) p.&nbsp;1</ref> Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.<ref>Wyman, ''The Wisconsin Frontier'', p.&nbsp;293</ref>\n\n=== Southwest ===\n{{See also|Old Southwest}}\n[[File:Map of Santa Fe Trail-NPS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the [[Santa Fe Trail]]]]\nFrom the 1770s to the 1830s, pioneers moved into the new lands that stretched from Kentucky to Alabama to Texas. Most were farmers who moved in family groups.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' (5th ed. 1982) pp.&nbsp;203\u2013328, 747\u201366</ref>\n\nHistorian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was; they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up, they sold out and moved west to try again. Hacker describes that in Kentucky about 1812:\n\n{{quote|Farms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, possessing log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, enclosed in fences, and having plenty of standing timber for fuel. The land was sown in wheat and corn, which were the staples, while hemp [for making rope] was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms....\n\nYet, on the whole, it was an agricultural society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1892931|title = Western Land Hunger and the War of 1812: A Conjecture|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 365\u2013395|last1 = Hacker|first1 = Louis Morton|year = 1924|doi = 10.2307/1892931}}</ref>}}\nHacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land, repaired the damage, and practiced a more sustainable agriculture. Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] explored the individualistic worldview and values of the first generation:\n\n{{quote|What they objected to was arbitrary obstacles, artificial limitations upon the freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his own career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve pre\u00ebminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) p.&nbsp;342.</ref>}}\n\n=== Manifest Destiny ===\n{{Main|Manifest Destiny}}\n[[File:United States 1834-1836-03.png|thumb|upright=1.6|United States territories in 1834\u201336]]\nManifest Destiny was the belief that the United States was preordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. The concept was expressed during Colonial times, but the term was coined in the 1840s by a popular magazine which editorialized, \"the fulfillment of our manifest destiny...to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" As the nation grew, \"Manifest Destiny\" became a rallying cry for expansionists in the Democratic Party. In the 1840s the Tyler and Polk administrations (1841\u201349) successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine. However the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which represented business and financial interests, stood opposed to Manifest Destiny.

A few hundred foreigners were scattered in the northern districts, including some Americans. With the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846 the U.S. sent in Fr\u00e9mont and a [[U.S. Army]] unit, as well as naval forces, and quickly took control.<ref>Kevin Starr, ''California: A History'' (2007) pp.&nbsp;43\u201370</ref> As the war was ending, gold was discovered in the north, and the word soon spread worldwide.\n\nThousands of \"Forty-Niners\" reached California, by sailing around South America (or taking a short-cut through disease-ridden Panama), or walked the California trail. The population soared to over 200,000 in 1852, mostly in the gold districts that stretched into the mountains east of San Francisco.\n\nHousing in San Francisco was at a premium, and abandoned ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging. In the gold fields themselves living conditions were primitive, though the mild climate proved attractive. Supplies were expensive and food poor, typical diets consisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. These highly male, transient communities with no established institutions were prone to high levels of violence, drunkenness, profanity, and greed-driven behavior. Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their own ad hoc legal system, based on the \"mining codes\" used in other mining communities abroad. Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote, sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantis; with Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon Morris Bakken|title=Law in the western United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjHQWyttp6QC&pg=PA209|year=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=209\u201314|isbn=9780806132150}}</ref>\n\nThe gold rush radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals, including precious metal specialists, merchants, doctors, and attorneys, who added to the population of miners, saloon keepers, gamblers, and prostitutes.

In a few years, nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, at the end of the '49 gold rush, through 1883, [[hydraulic mining]] was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. Hydraulic mining ended when public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.<ref>Walter Nugent, ''American West Chronicle'' (2007) p 119.</ref>\n\nThe mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to [[Dakota Territory|South Dakota]] contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites, where prospectors discovered gold, silver, copper and other minerals (as well as some soft-rock coal). Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight; most became [[ghost towns]] when the ores were depleted. Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest.

They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the [[Oregon Trail]]. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1979).</ref>\n\nIn the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", some 700 to 1,000 emigrants headed for Oregon; missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] led the wagons on the last leg. In 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about 2,000 miles (3,200&nbsp;km).<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1993)</ref> Though the main direction of travel on the early wagon trails was westward, people also used the Oregon Trail to travel eastward. Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated. Some returned with bags of gold and silver. Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west.

Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms.

With the passage of the extremely controversial [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery: [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called \"Jayhawkers\" or \"Free-soilers\") financed the migration of politically determined settlers. But pro-slavery advocates fought back with pro-slavery settlers from Missouri.<ref>Thomas Goodrich, ''War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854\u20131861'' (2004)</ref> Violence on both sides was the result; in all 56 men were killed by the time the violence abated in 1859.<ref>Dale Watts, \"How Bloody Was Bleeding Kansas?

Throughout the 19th century, Army officers typically served built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement. Actual combat experience was uncommon for any one soldier.<ref>Samuel J. Watson, ''Peacekeepers and Conquerors: The Army Officer Corps on the American Frontier, 1821\u20131846'' (2013)</ref>\n\nThe most dramatic conflict was the [[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux war in Minnesota]] in 1862, when Dakota tribes systematically attacked German farms in an effort to drive out the settlers. Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], slaughtered 300 to 400 white settlers. The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops. The ensuing battles at [[Battle of Fort Ridgely|Fort Ridgely]], [[Battle of Birch Coulee|Birch Coulee]], [[Fort Abercrombie]], and [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]] punctuated a six-week war, which ended in American victory. The federal government tried 425 Indians for murder, and 303 were convicted and sentenced to death. Lincoln pardoned the majority, but 38 leaders were hanged.<ref>Kenneth Carley, ''The Dakota War of 1862'' (Minnesota Historical Society, 2nd ed. 2001)</ref>\n\nThe decreased presence of Union troops in the West left behind untrained militias; hostile tribes used the opportunity to attack settlers. The militia struck back hard, most notably by attacking the winter quarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians, filled with women and children, at the [[Sand Creek massacre]] in eastern Colorado in late 1864.<ref>Stan Hoig, ''The Sand Creek Massacre'' (1974)</ref>\n\n[[Kit Carson]] and the U.S. Army in 1864 trapped the entire [[Navajo]] tribe in New Mexico, where they had been raiding settlers, and put them on a reservation.<ref>Richard C.

The result by 1890 was millions of new farms in the Plains states, many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia.\n\n== The Postbellum West ==\n\n=== Territorial governance after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Fsstockade.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] Stockade, February 1869]]\n\nWith the war over and slavery abolished, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much \"red tape\", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.<ref>Jack Ericson Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires: Governors and Territorial Government, 1784\u20131912'' (U. of Pittsburgh Press 1968)</ref>\n\nFederal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.<ref>Richard White (1991), p.&nbsp;177</ref>\n\nTerritorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.<ref>Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires'' p.&nbsp;190</ref>\n\nThese improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering. As [[Mark Twain]] wrote while working for his brother, the secretary of Nevada, \"The government of my country snubs honest simplicity, but fondles artistic villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Twain|title=Roughing it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAZEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA181|year=1913|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=181}}</ref> \"Territorial rings\", corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage, embezzled from Indian tribes and local citizens, especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Phillips|author2=Alan Axelrod|title=Encyclopedia of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MNXAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Simon & Schuster|volume=2|isbn=9780028974958}}</ref>\n\n=== Federal land system ===\n\n[[File:Homesteader NE 1866.png|thumb|[[Homestead Act of 1862|Homesteaders]] [[circa|c.]] 1866]]\n\nIn acquiring, preparing, and distributing public land to private ownership, the federal government generally followed the system set forth by the [[Land Ordinance of 1785|Land Ordinance]] of 1785. Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaty, land title would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10&nbsp;km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at [[public auction]]. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.<ref>Richard White (1991), ch 6</ref>\n\nAs part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of \"land script\". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vernon Webster Johnson|author2=Raleigh Barlowe|title=Land Problems and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoHUQQFXzKAC&pg=PA40|year=1979|publisher=Ayer Publishing|page=40|isbn=9780405113789}}</ref> Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious. As a counter to land speculators, farmers formed \"claims clubs\" to enable them to buy larger tracts than the {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1902928|title = The Iowa Claim Clubs: Symbol and Substance|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 45|issue = 2|pages = 231\u2013253|last1 = Bogue|first1 = Allan G.|year = 1958|doi = 10.2307/1902928}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, Congress passed three important bills that transformed the land system. The [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]] granted {{convert|160|acre|km2}} free to each settler who improved the land for five years; citizens and non-citizens including squatters and women, were all eligible. The only cost was a modest filing fee. The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states. Many took free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates.<ref>Harold M. Hyman, ''American Singularity: The 1787 Northwest Ordinance, the 1862 Homestead and Morrill Acts, and the 1944 GI Bill'' (U of Georgia Press, 2008)</ref><ref>Sarah T.

The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In an effort to be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.<ref>Kurt E. Kinbacher, and William G. Thoms III, \"Shaping Nebraska\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'' (2008) 28#3 pp.&nbsp;191\u2013207.</ref>\n\nThe [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 provided land grants to states to begin colleges of agriculture and mechanical arts (engineering). Black colleges became eligible for these land grants in 1890. The Act succeeded in its goals to open new universities and make farming more scientific and profitable.<ref>{{cite book|author=David J.

Much of this work was undertaken by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]], and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys, and became known as \"The Great Reconnaissance\". Regionalism animated debates in Congress regarding the choice of a northern, central or southern route. Engineering requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood, and as nearly-level route as possible, given the weak locomotives of the era.<ref>Frank N.

With the secession of the Confederate states in 1861, the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California. Private companies were to build and operate the line. Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work. [[Theodore Judah]], the chief engineer of the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah's tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 [[Pacific Railroad Act]], which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the [[History of the Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] (which built west from Omaha).<ref>David Haward Bain, ''[[Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad]]'' New York: Penguin Books (1999) p.&nbsp;155</ref> In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants ([[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]]) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.\n\nThe road was built with mortgages from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money\u2014later repaid\u2014at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.\n\nMost of the manual laborers on the Central Pacific were new arrivals from China.<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Alexander Saxton|last1=Saxton|first1=Alexander|title=The Army of Canton in the High Sierra|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=35|issue=2|pages=141\u2013152|jstor=3636678|year=1966|doi=10.2307/3636678}}</ref> Kraus shows how these men lived and worked, and how they managed their money.

Ong explores whether or not the [[Chinese Railroad Workers]] were exploited by the railroad, with whites in the better positions.

The work was highly physical, using horse-drawn plows and scrapers, and manual picks, axes, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were used. The rails were iron (steel came a few years later) and weighed {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}. and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used black powder. The Union Pacific construction crews, mostly Irish Americans, averaged about two miles (3&nbsp;km) of new track per day.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edwin Legrand Sabin|title=Building the Pacific railway: the construction-story of America's first iron thoroughfare between the Missouri river and California, from the inception of the great idea to the day, May 10, 1869, when the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific joined tracks at Promotory point, Utah, to form the nation's transcontinental|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXO6x1nSldYC&pg=PA13|year=1919|author-link=Edwin Legrand Sabin}}</ref>\n\nSix transcontinental railroads were built in the [[Gilded Age]] (plus two in Canada); they opened up the West to farmers and ranchers. From north to south they were the Northern Pacific, [[Milwaukee Road]], and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] along the Canada\u2013US border; the Union Pacific/Central Pacific in the middle, and to the south the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], and the Southern Pacific. All but the Great Northern of [[James J. Hill]] relied on land grants. The financial stories were often complex. For example, the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in 1864. Financier [[Jay Cooke]] (1821\u20131905) was in charge until 1873, when he went bankrupt. Federal courts, however, kept bankrupt railroads in operation. In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] (1835\u20131900) took over and finally completed the line to Seattle. But the line went bankrupt in the [[Panic of 1893]] and Hill took it over. He then merged several lines with financing from [[J.P. Morgan]], but President Theodore Roosevelt [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|broke them up in 1904]].<ref>Ross R. Cotroneo, \"The Northern Pacific: Years of Difficulty\", ''Kansas Quarterly'' (1970) 2#3 pp.&nbsp;69\u201377</ref>\n\nIn the first year of operation, 1869\u201370, 150,000 passengers made the long trip. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years. The railroads had \"Immigration Bureaus\" which advertised package low-cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia. The prairies, they were promised, did not mean backbreaking toil because \"settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber\".<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' pp.&nbsp;646\u20137</ref> The settlers were customers of the railroads, shipping their crops and cattle out, and bringing in manufactured products. All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business.<ref>Sarah Gordon, ''Passage to Union: How the Railroads Transformed American Life, 1829\u20131929'' (1998)</ref>\n\nWhite concludes with a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many thousands of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east\u2013west axis, and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.<ref>Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011)</ref>\n\n=== Migration after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Picturesque America58.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'', 1872, shows settlers crossing the [[Great Plains]]. By [[F.O.C. Darley]] and engraved by [[Henry Bryan Hall|H.B.

The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable.<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' ch 32</ref>\n\nThe fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to faced challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and fearsome tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/ourstory/activities/sodhouse/more.html|title=Life on the Prairie |publisher=American History |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}</ref> In the treeless prairies homesteaders built sod houses.

U.S. Secretary of State [[William Seward]] negotiated with the Russians to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska, an area roughly one-fifth the size of the rest of the United States. On March 30, 1867, the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russians for $7.2&nbsp;million ($118&nbsp;million in today's dollars). The transfer ceremony was completed in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] on October 18, 1867, as Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army.\n\nCritics at the time decried the purchase as \"Seward's Folly\", reasoning that there was no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold, icy climate. Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slowly, the discovery of gold fields during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1896, [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1898, and [[Fairbanks Gold Rush]] in 1902 brought thousands of miners into the territory, thus propelling Alaska's prosperity for decades to come.

Within 48 hours after the overthrow, the new Hawaiian government was recognized by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the U.S., United Kingdom, and Japan.\n\nU.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] insisted that Lili\u02bbuokalani be restored back to her throne, but Dole refused and instead proclaimed the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] on July 4, 1894. Cleveland was unwilling to overthrow the government by force, and his successor, [[William McKinley]], negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Hawaii in 1897. In April 1898, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] broke out, and the strategic use of a [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in the Pacific during the war convinced the U.S. government the necessity for the Hawaiian annexation. On July 4, 1898, Congress passed the [[Newlands Resolution]], which annexed Hawaii. It was signed into law by President McKinley three days later and came into effect on August 12, 1898, officially creating the [[Territory of Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hyslop|first=Stephen G.|title=National Geographic: The Old West|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-1555-1|pages=230\u201345}}</ref>\n\n== Indian Wars ==\n\n[[File:Sitting Bull.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief [[Sitting Bull]]]]\n{{Main|American Indian Wars}}\n\nIndian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories; the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi.

The Indians were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of President [[Andrew Jackson]] demanded removal of the Indians out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The [[Jacksonian Democracy]] proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832 and 1836. By 1837 the \"Indian Removal policy\" began, to implement the act of Congress signed by [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson.<ref>However Jackson's policy is defended as benign by Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2001) pp.&nbsp;226\u201353, and by Francis Paul Prucha, \"Andrew Jackson's Indian Policy: A Reassessment\", ''Journal of American History'' (1969) 56:527\u201339 {{JSTOR|1904204}}.</ref> The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Indians, but in reality the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards.<ref>Alfred A.

To motivate Natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. By 1835 the Cherokee, the last Indian nation in the South, had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma. All the tribes were given new land in the \"[[Indian Territory]]\" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Indians removed, about 18,000 died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route.<ref>Osborn, William M., ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', Random House (2001) Chapter 7: Atrocities from the Trail of Tears to the Civil War. {{ISBN|978-0375758560}}</ref> This exodus has become known as [[The Trail of Tears]] (in Cherokee \"''Nunna dual Tsuny''\", \"The Trail Where they Cried\"). The impact of the removals was severe. The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area.<ref>Theda Perdue, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2008) ch.&nbsp;6, 7</ref>\n\nThe only way for an Indian to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many Natives who took the offer were defrauded by \"ravenous speculators\" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached {{convert|3800000|acre|km2}}. Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20&nbsp;million.<ref>John K.

The Indians emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts, developing a logistics system, and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces. Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the \"modern\" warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines, using its vast advantages in population and resources. Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U.S. Army. The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and, therefore, were unable to have any permanent success against the Army.<ref>Anthony R. McGinnis, \"When Courage Was Not Enough: Plains Indians at War with the United States Army\", ''Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#2 pp.&nbsp;455\u2013473.</ref>\n\nIndian wars were fought throughout the western regions, with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and the Natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Michno, ''Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850\u20131890'' p.&nbsp;367</ref>\n\nOne of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the [[Snake War]] in 1864\u20131868, which was conducted by a confederacy of [[Northern Paiute]], [[Bannock people|Bannock]] and [[Shoshone]] Native Americans, called the \"Snake Indians\" against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Oregon, Volume II, 1848\u20131888'', The History Company, San Francisco, 1888, p.&nbsp;462, note&nbsp;4.</ref> The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the [[Snake River]] Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.<ref>Michno, Gregory, ''The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864\u20131868''. Caldwell: Caxton Press, 2007. pp.&nbsp;345\u2013346</ref>\n\nThe [[Colorado War]] fought by [[Cheyenne]], Arapaho and Sioux, was fought in the territories of Colorado to Nebraska. The conflict was fought in 1863\u20131865 while the American Civil War was still ongoing. Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region, the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties. White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Indian women and children such as the bloody [[Sand Creek massacre]], and the Indians also raided ranches, farms and killed white families such as the [[American Ranch massacre]] and [[Raid on Godfrey Ranch]].<ref>Hyde, George E.

They served as bases for troops at or near strategic areas, particularly for counteracting the Indian presence. For example, [[Fort Bowie]] protected [[Apache Pass]] in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against [[Cochise]] and [[Geronimo]]. [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Fort Kearny]] helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners. Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux. As Indian reservations sprang up, the military set up forts to protect them. Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines. Other important forts were [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]], Arkansas, [[Fort Snelling]], Minnesota, [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], New Mexico, [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and [[Fort Walla Walla]] in Washington. [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska, was home to the [[Department of the Platte]], and was responsible for outfitting most Western posts for more than 20 years after its founding in the late 1870s.

Robert L. Munkres read 66 diaries of parties traveling the Oregon Trail between 1834 and 1860 to estimate the actual dangers they faced from Indian attacks in Nebraska and Wyoming. The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all. However many did report harassment by Indians who begged or demanded tolls, and stole horses and cattle.<ref>Robert L.

A second treaty secured safe passage along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] for wagon trains. In return, the tribes would receive, for ten years, annual compensation for damages caused by migrants.<ref>Burton S. Hill, \"The Great Indian Treaty Council of 1851\", ''Nebraska History'', (1966) 47#1 pp.&nbsp;85\u2013110</ref> The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas as the federal government sought those lands for the future [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]]. In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes, causing considerable friction. In Utah, the [[Mormons]] also moved in before federal ownership was obtained.\n\nA new policy of establishing reservations came gradually into shape after the boundaries of the \"Indian Territory\" began to be ignored. In providing for Indian reservations, Congress and the [[Office of Indian Affairs]] hoped to de-tribalize Native Americans and prepare them for integration with the rest of American society, the \"ultimate incorporation into the great body of our citizen population\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Francis Paul|last=Prucha|title=The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&pg=PA324|year=1995|publisher=U. of Nebraska Press|page=324|isbn=0-8032-8734-8}}</ref> This allowed for the development of dozens of riverfront towns along the [[Missouri River]] in the new [[Nebraska Territory]], which was carved from the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase after the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].

On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten<ref>Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Settlers' Children: Growing Up on the Great Plains'' (1991)</ref> and Lillian Schlissel<ref>Lillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens and Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Far from Home: Families of the Westward Journey'' (2002)</ref> offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (1300+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The [[Chisholm Trail]], laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5&nbsp;million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the {{convert|800|mi|km}} from south Texas to [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3&nbsp;km) of cattle six abreast. Despite the risks, a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved, as the price of one steer was $4 in Texas and $40 back East.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ted|last=Morgan|title=Shovel of Stars: The Making of the American West 1800 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aveRrVPqc0UC&pg=PA257|year=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=257|isbn=978-0-684-81492-6}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1870s and 1880s, cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakota territory, using the rails to ship to both coasts.

The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying.

Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Dodge City]], and [[Ellsworth, Kansas|Ellsworth]] experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became [[ghost town]]s and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued on after the grazing lands were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert R.|last=Dykstra|title=The Cattle Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t15L9AfXlPcC&pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6561-5}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation and environmentalism ==\n {{See also|Sagebrush Rebellion}}\n[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|1908 editorial cartoon of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] features his cowboy persona and his crusading for conservation.]]\n\nConcern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late 19th century, pitting different interests. On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum [[exploitation of natural resources]] to maximize jobs, economic growth, and their own profit.<ref>Char Miller, ''Gifford Pinchot and the making of modern environmentalism'' (2001) p.&nbsp;4</ref>\n\nIn the center were the [[conservation movement|conservationists]], led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his coalition of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with [[Gifford Pinchot]] and used the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230&nbsp;million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi{{sup|2}} or 930,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, [[national park]]s, and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.<ref>Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt explained his position in 1910:\n\n{{quote|Conservation means development as much as it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.<ref>W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003) p.&nbsp;25</ref>}}\n\nThe third element, smallest at first but growing rapidly after 1870, were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake, and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits. Their leader was [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914), a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake, and founder of the [[Sierra Club]]. Muir, based in California, in 1889 started organizing support to preserve the [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoias]] in the [[Yosemite Valley]]; Congress did pass the [[Yosemite National Park]] bill (1890). In 1897 President [[Grover Cleveland]] created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move. Muir, taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet,<ref>Dennis C. Williams, ''God's wilds: John Muir's vision of nature'' (2002) p.&nbsp;134</ref> crusaded against the lumberman, portraying it as a contest \"between landscape righteousness and the devil\".<ref>Robert L. Dorman, ''A word for nature: four pioneering environmental advocates, 1845\u20131913'' (1998) p.&nbsp;159</ref> A master publicist, Muir's magazine articles, in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (June 5, 1897) and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' turned the tide of public sentiment.<ref>John Muir, [http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=atla;idno=atla0080-2 \"The American Forests\"]</ref> He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt's program of setting aside national monuments, national forest reserves, and national parks. However Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President [[William Howard Taft]] on the [[Hetch Hetchy]] dam, which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco. Biographer [[Donald Worster]] says, \"Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Worster|title=A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuAsAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.

Once numbering over 25&nbsp;million on the [[Great Plains]], the grass-eating herds were a vital resource animal for the [[Plains Indians]], providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction.

During the same period, [[P. T. Barnum]] presented Indian chiefs, dances, and other Wild West exhibits in his museums. However, large scale awareness really took off when the [[dime novel]] appeared in 1859, the first being ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter''.<ref>Robert M. Utley (2003), p.&nbsp;253</ref> By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public's attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism, and fixed in the public's mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains\u2014courageous cowboys and savage Indians, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days. The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S. Ellis' ''Seth Jones'' (1860). [[Ned Buntline]]'s stories glamorized [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Edward Lytton Wheeler|Edward L.

Lamar (1977), pp.&nbsp;303\u2013304</ref>\n\nBuffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U.S. and Europe. He presented the first \"Wild West\" show in 1883, featuring a recreation of famous battles (especially Custer's Last Stand), expert marksmanship, and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and Indians, as well as sure-shooting [[Annie Oakley]].<ref>Joy S.

This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]], giving rise to the [[expansionism|expansionist]] philosophy known as \"[[Manifest Destiny]]\".\n\nA \"[[frontier]]\" is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement. Leading theorist [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] went deeper, arguing that the frontier was the defining process of American civilization: \"The frontier,\" he asserted, \"promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people.\" He theorized it was a process of development: \"This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward...furnish[es] the forces dominating American character.\"<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History, in Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) pp. 1\u201338. [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/afp/turner.htm online]</ref> Turner's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians (and critics) to explore multiple individual American frontiers, but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Texas]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and [[Hawaii]].\n\nIn 19th- and early 20th-century media, enormous popular attention was focused on the [[Western United States]] in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, from the 1850s to the 1910s, a period sometimes called the '''Old West''' or the '''Wild West'''. Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect. This eventually inspired the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre of film, which spilled over into [[television show]]s, [[Western fiction|novels]], [[comic books]], and [[video game]]s, as well as children's toys and costumes.\n\nAs defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states.\" They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Robert V. | last=Hine | author2=John Mack Faragher | title=The American West: A New Interpretive History | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | year=2000 | page=[https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 10] | isbn=978-0300078350 | url=https://archive.org/details/americanwestinte00hine/page/10 }}</ref>  Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans: \"The existence of an area of\nfree land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.\"<ref>Quoted in William Cronon,  \"Revisiting the vanishing frontier: The legacy of Frederick Jackson Turner.\" ''Western Historical Quarterly'' 18.2 (1987): 157\u2013176, at p. 157.</ref> Through treaties with foreign nations and [[Native Americans in the United States|native tribes]], political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, the building of farms, ranches, and towns, the marking of trails and digging of mines, and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Turner, in his \"[[Frontier Thesis]]\" (1893), theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as [[individualism]], self-reliance, and even violence.\n\nAs the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took a firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike. In David Murdoch's view, [[American exceptionalism|America is exceptional]] in choosing its iconic self-image: \"No other nation has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America's creation of the West.\"<ref name=\"Murdoch\">{{cite book | first=David | last=Murdoch | title=The American West: The Invention of a Myth | publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] | isbn= 978-0874173697 | year = 2001| page= vii | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3dFIhTAVvNQC&pg=PR7}}</ref>\n\n== Terms ''West'' and ''frontier'' ==\n[[File:Distribution of US Rural Population during 1900.pdf|thumb|Map from [[1900 United States Census|1900 U.S. census]] showing the westward moving frontier line.]]\nThe [[frontier]] is the margin of undeveloped territory that would comprise the [[United States]] beyond the established frontier line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frontier|title=Definition of FRONTIER|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/margin|title=Definition of MARGIN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref> The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] designated frontier territory as generally unoccupied land with a population density of less than 2 people per square mile.

The American frontier began when [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia, was settled by the English in 1607. In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic coast, until about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier'' (5th ed. 2001) ch.&nbsp;1\u20137</ref> English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these [[habitants]] settled in villages along the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and midwest region they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]]<ref>Clarence Walworth Alvord, ''The Illinois Country 1673\u20131818'' (1918)</ref> as well as a larger settlement around [[New Orleans]]. Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning [[patroon]]s who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.<ref>Sung Bok Kim, ''Landlord and Tenant in Colonial New York: Manorial Society, 1664\u20131775'' (1987)</ref>\n\nAreas in the north that were in the frontier stage by 1700 generally had poor transportation facilities, so the opportunity for commercial agriculture was low. These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture, and as a result, by the 1760s these societies were highly egalitarian, as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main:\n{{quote|The typical frontier society, therefore, was one in which class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and there were a number of landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.<ref>Jackson Turner Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;11.</ref>}}\n\nIn the South, frontier areas that lacked transportation, such as the Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However, frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought up the good land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer \"frontier\". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.<ref>Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p.&nbsp;44\u201346.</ref>\n{{anchor|The Near West|Near West|near west}}<!-- redirect target - -->\n\n=== From British peasants to American farmers ===\n\nThe seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers, and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farmland.<ref>Allan Kulikoff, ''From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers'' (2000)</ref> Unlike Britain, where a small number of landlords owned most of the good land, ownership in America was cheap, easy and widespread.

He identified these layers as multiple \"frontiers\" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.<ref>Mark Wyman, '' The Wisconsin Frontier'' (2009) pp.&nbsp;182, 293\u201394</ref>\n\nFrederick Jackson Turner grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant.\"<ref>Merle Curti, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959) p.&nbsp;1</ref> Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.<ref>Wyman, ''The Wisconsin Frontier'', p.&nbsp;293</ref>\n\n=== Southwest ===\n{{See also|Old Southwest}}\n[[File:Map of Santa Fe Trail-NPS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the [[Santa Fe Trail]]]]\nFrom the 1770s to the 1830s, pioneers moved into the new lands that stretched from Kentucky to Alabama to Texas. Most were farmers who moved in family groups.<ref>Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' (5th ed. 1982) pp.&nbsp;203\u2013328, 747\u201366</ref>\n\nHistorian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was; they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up, they sold out and moved west to try again. Hacker describes that in Kentucky about 1812:\n\n{{quote|Farms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, possessing log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, enclosed in fences, and having plenty of standing timber for fuel. The land was sown in wheat and corn, which were the staples, while hemp [for making rope] was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms....\n\nYet, on the whole, it was an agricultural society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1892931|title = Western Land Hunger and the War of 1812: A Conjecture|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 365\u2013395|last1 = Hacker|first1 = Louis Morton|year = 1924|doi = 10.2307/1892931}}</ref>}}\nHacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land, repaired the damage, and practiced a more sustainable agriculture. Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] explored the individualistic worldview and values of the first generation:\n\n{{quote|What they objected to was arbitrary obstacles, artificial limitations upon the freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his own career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve pre\u00ebminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.<ref>Frederick Jackson Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) p.&nbsp;342.</ref>}}\n\n=== Manifest Destiny ===\n{{Main|Manifest Destiny}}\n[[File:United States 1834-1836-03.png|thumb|upright=1.6|United States territories in 1834\u201336]]\nManifest Destiny was the belief that the United States was preordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. The concept was expressed during Colonial times, but the term was coined in the 1840s by a popular magazine which editorialized, \"the fulfillment of our manifest destiny...to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" As the nation grew, \"Manifest Destiny\" became a rallying cry for expansionists in the Democratic Party. In the 1840s the Tyler and Polk administrations (1841\u201349) successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine. However the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which represented business and financial interests, stood opposed to Manifest Destiny.

Tensions rose, however, after an abortive attempt to establish the independent nation of [[Fredonian Rebellion|Fredonia]] in 1826. [[William Travis]], leading the \"war party\", advocated for independence from Mexico, while the \"peace party\" led by Austin attempted to get more autonomy within the current relationship. When Mexican president [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] shifted alliances and joined the conservative Centralist party, he declared himself dictator and ordered soldiers into Texas to curtail new immigration and unrest.

The U.S. Congress declined to annex Texas, stalemated by contentious arguments over slavery and regional power. Thus, the [[Republic of Texas]] remained an independent power for nearly a decade before it was annexed as the 28th state in 1845.

In a few years, nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, at the end of the '49 gold rush, through 1883, [[hydraulic mining]] was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. Hydraulic mining ended when public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.<ref>Walter Nugent, ''American West Chronicle'' (2007) p 119.</ref>\n\nThe mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to [[Dakota Territory|South Dakota]] contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites, where prospectors discovered gold, silver, copper and other minerals (as well as some soft-rock coal). Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight; most became [[ghost towns]] when the ores were depleted. Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest. Soon gold was discovered in [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush|Colorado]], Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and South Dakota (by 1864).\n<ref>Rodman W.

They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the [[Oregon Trail]]. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1979).</ref>\n\nIn the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", some 700 to 1,000 emigrants headed for Oregon; missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] led the wagons on the last leg. In 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about 2,000 miles (3,200&nbsp;km).<ref>John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840\u20131860'' (1993)</ref> Though the main direction of travel on the early wagon trails was westward, people also used the Oregon Trail to travel eastward. Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated. Some returned with bags of gold and silver. Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west.

California unanimously rejected slavery in 1850 and became a free state. New Mexico allowed slavery, but it was rarely seen there. Kansas was off limits to slavery by the Compromise of 1820. Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms. Few Southern planters were actually interested in Kansas, but the idea that slavery was illegal there implied they had a second-class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor, and seemed to violate the principle of [[state's rights]]. With the passage of the extremely controversial [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery: [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called \"Jayhawkers\" or \"Free-soilers\") financed the migration of politically determined settlers.

Throughout the 19th century, Army officers typically served built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement. Actual combat experience was uncommon for any one soldier.<ref>Samuel J.

Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], slaughtered 300 to 400 white settlers. The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops. The ensuing battles at [[Battle of Fort Ridgely|Fort Ridgely]], [[Battle of Birch Coulee|Birch Coulee]], [[Fort Abercrombie]], and [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]] punctuated a six-week war, which ended in American victory.

The result by 1890 was millions of new farms in the Plains states, many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia.\n\n== The Postbellum West ==\n\n=== Territorial governance after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Fsstockade.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] Stockade, February 1869]]\n\nWith the war over and slavery abolished, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much \"red tape\", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.<ref>Jack Ericson Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires: Governors and Territorial Government, 1784\u20131912'' (U. of Pittsburgh Press 1968)</ref>\n\nFederal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.<ref>Richard White (1991), p.&nbsp;177</ref>\n\nTerritorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.<ref>Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires'' p.&nbsp;190</ref>\n\nThese improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering.

Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaty, land title would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10&nbsp;km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at [[public auction]]. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.<ref>Richard White (1991), ch 6</ref>\n\nAs part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of \"land script\". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vernon Webster Johnson|author2=Raleigh Barlowe|title=Land Problems and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoHUQQFXzKAC&pg=PA40|year=1979|publisher=Ayer Publishing|page=40|isbn=9780405113789}}</ref> Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious. As a counter to land speculators, farmers formed \"claims clubs\" to enable them to buy larger tracts than the {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1902928|title = The Iowa Claim Clubs: Symbol and Substance|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 45|issue = 2|pages = 231\u2013253|last1 = Bogue|first1 = Allan G.|year = 1958|doi = 10.2307/1902928}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, Congress passed three important bills that transformed the land system. The [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]] granted {{convert|160|acre|km2}} free to each settler who improved the land for five years; citizens and non-citizens including squatters and women, were all eligible. The only cost was a modest filing fee. The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states. Many took free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates.<ref>Harold M.

The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In an effort to be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.<ref>Kurt E. Kinbacher, and William G.

Much of this work was undertaken by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]], and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys, and became known as \"The Great Reconnaissance\". Regionalism animated debates in Congress regarding the choice of a northern, central or southern route. Engineering requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood, and as nearly-level route as possible, given the weak locomotives of the era.<ref>Frank N.

With the secession of the Confederate states in 1861, the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California. Private companies were to build and operate the line. Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work. [[Theodore Judah]], the chief engineer of the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah's tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 [[Pacific Railroad Act]], which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the [[History of the Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] (which built west from Omaha).<ref>David Haward Bain, ''[[Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad]]'' New York: Penguin Books (1999) p.&nbsp;155</ref> In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants ([[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]]) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.\n\nThe road was built with mortgages from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money\u2014later repaid\u2014at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.\n\nMost of the manual laborers on the Central Pacific were new arrivals from China.<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Alexander Saxton|last1=Saxton|first1=Alexander|title=The Army of Canton in the High Sierra|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=35|issue=2|pages=141\u2013152|jstor=3636678|year=1966|doi=10.2307/3636678}}</ref> Kraus shows how these men lived and worked, and how they managed their money.

The work was highly physical, using horse-drawn plows and scrapers, and manual picks, axes, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were used. The rails were iron (steel came a few years later) and weighed {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}. and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used black powder.

From north to south they were the Northern Pacific, [[Milwaukee Road]], and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] along the Canada\u2013US border; the Union Pacific/Central Pacific in the middle, and to the south the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], and the Southern Pacific. All but the Great Northern of [[James J. Hill]] relied on land grants. The financial stories were often complex. For example, the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in 1864. Financier [[Jay Cooke]] (1821\u20131905) was in charge until 1873, when he went bankrupt. Federal courts, however, kept bankrupt railroads in operation. In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] (1835\u20131900) took over and finally completed the line to Seattle. But the line went bankrupt in the [[Panic of 1893]] and Hill took it over. He then merged several lines with financing from [[J.P. Morgan]], but President Theodore Roosevelt [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|broke them up in 1904]].<ref>Ross R. Cotroneo, \"The Northern Pacific: Years of Difficulty\", ''Kansas Quarterly'' (1970) 2#3 pp.&nbsp;69\u201377</ref>\n\nIn the first year of operation, 1869\u201370, 150,000 passengers made the long trip. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years. The railroads had \"Immigration Bureaus\" which advertised package low-cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia. The prairies, they were promised, did not mean backbreaking toil because \"settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber\".<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' pp.&nbsp;646\u20137</ref> The settlers were customers of the railroads, shipping their crops and cattle out, and bringing in manufactured products. All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business.<ref>Sarah Gordon, ''Passage to Union: How the Railroads Transformed American Life, 1829\u20131929'' (1998)</ref>\n\nWhite concludes with a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many thousands of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east\u2013west axis, and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.<ref>Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011)</ref>\n\n=== Migration after the Civil War ===\n\n[[File:Picturesque America58.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'', 1872, shows settlers crossing the [[Great Plains]]. By [[F.O.C. Darley]] and engraved by [[Henry Bryan Hall|H.B. Hall]].]]\nAfter the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising \"the Best Prairie Lands\", \"Low Prices\", \"Large Discounts For Cash\", and \"Better Terms Than Ever!\". The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable.<ref>Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' ch 32</ref>\n\nThe fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to faced challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and fearsome tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/ourstory/activities/sodhouse/more.html|title=Life on the Prairie |publisher=American History |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}</ref> In the treeless prairies homesteaders built sod houses.

U.S. Secretary of State [[William Seward]] negotiated with the Russians to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska, an area roughly one-fifth the size of the rest of the United States. On March 30, 1867, the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russians for $7.2&nbsp;million ($118&nbsp;million in today's dollars). The transfer ceremony was completed in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] on October 18, 1867, as Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army.\n\nCritics at the time decried the purchase as \"Seward's Folly\", reasoning that there was no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold, icy climate. Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slowly, the discovery of gold fields during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1896, [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1898, and [[Fairbanks Gold Rush]] in 1902 brought thousands of miners into the territory, thus propelling Alaska's prosperity for decades to come. Major oil discoveries in the late 20th century made the state rich.<ref>Howard Kushner, \"The significance of the Alaska purchase to American expansion.\" in S. Frederick Starr, ed., ''Russia's American Colony''. (1987): 295\u2013315.</ref>\n\n=== Annexation of Hawaii ===\n{{Main|Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}\nOn January 17, 1893, the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was overthrown when a group of American and European businessmen and sugar planters forced Queen [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] to abdicate her throne. That same day, the coup organizers created the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] and appointed Hawaiian jurist [[Sanford Ballard Dole]] as the islands' first President, hoping that Hawaii would be annexed by the United States. Within 48 hours after the overthrow, the new Hawaiian government was recognized by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the U.S., United Kingdom, and Japan.\n\nU.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] insisted that Lili\u02bbuokalani be restored back to her throne, but Dole refused and instead proclaimed the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] on July 4, 1894. Cleveland was unwilling to overthrow the government by force, and his successor, [[William McKinley]], negotiated a treaty with the Republic of Hawaii in 1897. In April 1898, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] broke out, and the strategic use of a [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in the Pacific during the war convinced the U.S. government the necessity for the Hawaiian annexation. On July 4, 1898, Congress passed the [[Newlands Resolution]], which annexed Hawaii. It was signed into law by President McKinley three days later and came into effect on August 12, 1898, officially creating the [[Territory of Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hyslop|first=Stephen G.|title=National Geographic: The Old West|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-1555-1|pages=230\u201345}}</ref>\n\n== Indian Wars ==\n\n[[File:Sitting Bull.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief [[Sitting Bull]]]]\n{{Main|American Indian Wars}}\n\nIndian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories; the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi.

The Indians were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of President [[Andrew Jackson]] demanded removal of the Indians out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The [[Jacksonian Democracy]] proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832 and 1836. By 1837 the \"Indian Removal policy\" began, to implement the act of Congress signed by [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson.<ref>However Jackson's policy is defended as benign by Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2001) pp.&nbsp;226\u201353, and by Francis Paul Prucha, \"Andrew Jackson's Indian Policy: A Reassessment\", ''Journal of American History'' (1969) 56:527\u201339 {{JSTOR|1904204}}.</ref> The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Indians, but in reality the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards.<ref>Alfred A.

To motivate Natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. By 1835 the Cherokee, the last Indian nation in the South, had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma. All the tribes were given new land in the \"[[Indian Territory]]\" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Indians removed, about 18,000 died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route.<ref>Osborn, William M., ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', Random House (2001) Chapter 7: Atrocities from the Trail of Tears to the Civil War. {{ISBN|978-0375758560}}</ref> This exodus has become known as [[The Trail of Tears]] (in Cherokee \"''Nunna dual Tsuny''\", \"The Trail Where they Cried\"). The impact of the removals was severe. The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area.<ref>Theda Perdue, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2008) ch.&nbsp;6, 7</ref>\n\nThe only way for an Indian to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many Natives who took the offer were defrauded by \"ravenous speculators\" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached {{convert|3800000|acre|km2}}. Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20&nbsp;million.<ref>John K.

The Indians emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts, developing a logistics system, and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces. Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the \"modern\" warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines, using its vast advantages in population and resources. Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U.S. Army. The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and, therefore, were unable to have any permanent success against the Army.<ref>Anthony R. McGinnis, \"When Courage Was Not Enough: Plains Indians at War with the United States Army\", ''Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#2 pp.&nbsp;455\u2013473.</ref>\n\nIndian wars were fought throughout the western regions, with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and the Natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Michno, ''Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850\u20131890'' p.&nbsp;367</ref>\n\nOne of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the [[Snake War]] in 1864\u20131868, which was conducted by a confederacy of [[Northern Paiute]], [[Bannock people|Bannock]] and [[Shoshone]] Native Americans, called the \"Snake Indians\" against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Oregon, Volume II, 1848\u20131888'', The History Company, San Francisco, 1888, p.&nbsp;462, note&nbsp;4.</ref> The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the [[Snake River]] Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.<ref>Michno, Gregory, ''The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864\u20131868''.

The conflict was fought in 1863\u20131865 while the American Civil War was still ongoing. Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region, the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties. White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Indian women and children such as the bloody [[Sand Creek massacre]], and the Indians also raided ranches, farms and killed white families such as the [[American Ranch massacre]] and [[Raid on Godfrey Ranch]].<ref>Hyde, George E.

For example, [[Fort Bowie]] protected [[Apache Pass]] in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against [[Cochise]] and [[Geronimo]]. [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Fort Kearny]] helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners. Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux. As Indian reservations sprang up, the military set up forts to protect them. Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines. Other important forts were [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]], Arkansas, [[Fort Snelling]], Minnesota, [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], New Mexico, [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and [[Fort Walla Walla]] in Washington.

The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all. However many did report harassment by Indians who begged or demanded tolls, and stole horses and cattle.<ref>Robert L.

A second treaty secured safe passage along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] for wagon trains. In return, the tribes would receive, for ten years, annual compensation for damages caused by migrants.<ref>Burton S. Hill, \"The Great Indian Treaty Council of 1851\", ''Nebraska History'', (1966) 47#1 pp.&nbsp;85\u2013110</ref> The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas as the federal government sought those lands for the future [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]]. In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes, causing considerable friction. In Utah, the [[Mormons]] also moved in before federal ownership was obtained.\n\nA new policy of establishing reservations came gradually into shape after the boundaries of the \"Indian Territory\" began to be ignored. In providing for Indian reservations, Congress and the [[Office of Indian Affairs]] hoped to de-tribalize Native Americans and prepare them for integration with the rest of American society, the \"ultimate incorporation into the great body of our citizen population\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Francis Paul|last=Prucha|title=The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&pg=PA324|year=1995|publisher=U. of Nebraska Press|page=324|isbn=0-8032-8734-8}}</ref> This allowed for the development of dozens of riverfront towns along the [[Missouri River]] in the new [[Nebraska Territory]], which was carved from the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase after the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].

The American frontiersmen relied on individual effort, in the context of very large quantities of unsettled land with weak external enemies. Israel by contrast, operated in a very small geographical zone, surrounded by more powerful neighbors. The Jewish pioneer was not building an individual or family enterprise, but was a conscious participant in nation building, with a high priority on collective and cooperative planned settlements. The Israeli pioneers brought in American experts on irrigation and agriculture to provide technical advice.

Most refugees went to Texas or California, and soon poor [[barrio]]s appeared in many border towns. Early on there was a criminal element as well. The California \"Robin Hood\", [[Joaquin Murieta]], led a gang in the 1850s which burned houses, killed miners, and robbed stagecoaches. In Texas, [[Juan Cortina]] led a 20-year campaign against Anglos and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], starting around 1859.<ref>Arnoldo De Leon and Richard Griswold Del Castillo, ''North to Aztlan: A History of Mexican Americans in the United States'' (2006)</ref>\n\n=== Family life ===\n\nOn the [[Great Plains]] very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands.<ref>Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880\u20131940'' (1992)</ref> During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools all contributed to this trend.<ref>Chad Montrie, \"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp.&nbsp;245\u2013258</ref>\n\nAlthough the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as [[barn raising]]s, corn huskings, quilting bees,<ref>Karl Ronning, \"Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880\u20131920\", ''Uncoverings'', (1992) Vol. 13, pp.&nbsp;169\u2013191</ref> [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange meetings]],<ref>Donald B.

One group of scholars, following the lead of novelists [[Willa Cather]] and [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris<ref>Katherine Harris, ''Long Vistas: Women and Families on Colorado Homesteads'' (1993)</ref> and Elliott West<ref>Elliott West, ''Growing Up with the Country: Childhood on the Far Western Frontier'' (1989)</ref> write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten<ref>Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Settlers' Children: Growing Up on the Great Plains'' (1991)</ref> and Lillian Schlissel<ref>Lillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens and Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Far from Home: Families of the Westward Journey'' (2002)</ref> offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (1300+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The [[Chisholm Trail]], laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5&nbsp;million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the {{convert|800|mi|km}} from south Texas to [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3&nbsp;km) of cattle six abreast. Despite the risks, a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved, as the price of one steer was $4 in Texas and $40 back East.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ted|last=Morgan|title=Shovel of Stars: The Making of the American West 1800 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aveRrVPqc0UC&pg=PA257|year=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=257|isbn=978-0-684-81492-6}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1870s and 1880s, cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakota territory, using the rails to ship to both coasts.

A severe winter engulfed the plains toward the end of 1886 and well into 1887, locking the prairie grass under ice and crusted snow which starving herds could not penetrate. The British lost most of their money\u2014as did eastern investors like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], but their investments did create a large industry that continues to cycle through boom and bust periods.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3111428|title = The Investment Boom in British-Texan Cattle Companies 1880\u20131885|journal = The Business History Review|volume = 34|issue = 4|pages = 421\u2013445|last1 = Graham|first1 = Richard|year = 1960|doi = 10.2307/3111428}}</ref>\n\nOn a much smaller scale sheep grazing was locally popular; sheep were easier to feed and needed less water. However, Americans did not eat mutton.

His real-life was a hard one and revolved around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard-earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. Working the cattle was not just a routine job but also a lifestyle that exulted in the freedom of the wide unsettled outdoors on horseback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ii.015|title=Cowboy Culture|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|last=Wishart|first=David J.}}</ref> Long drives hired one cowboy for about 250 head of cattle.<ref name=\"Howard R.

All the distinct clothing of the cowboy\u2014boots, saddles, hats, pants, [[chaps]], slickers, [[bandanna]]s, gloves, and collar-less shirts\u2014were practical and adaptable, designed for protection and comfort.

The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying. While camping every night, cowboys would often sing to their herd to keep them calm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingstories.com/Stories/Why%20Cowboys%20Sing.pdf|title=Why Cowboys Sing?|publisher=Wyoming Stories|first=Wylie Grant|last=Sherwin}}</ref> The workdays often lasted fourteen hours, with just six hours of sleep. It was grueling, dusty work, with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day. On the trail, drinking, gambling, and brawling were often prohibited and fined, and sometimes cursing as well. It was monotonous and boring work, with food to match: bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried fruit, and potatoes.

Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Dodge City]], and [[Ellsworth, Kansas|Ellsworth]] experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became [[ghost town]]s and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued on after the grazing lands were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert R.|last=Dykstra|title=The Cattle Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t15L9AfXlPcC&pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6561-5}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation and environmentalism ==\n {{See also|Sagebrush Rebellion}}\n[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|1908 editorial cartoon of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] features his cowboy persona and his crusading for conservation.]]\n\nConcern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late 19th century, pitting different interests. On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum [[exploitation of natural resources]] to maximize jobs, economic growth, and their own profit.<ref>Char Miller, ''Gifford Pinchot and the making of modern environmentalism'' (2001) p.&nbsp;4</ref>\n\nIn the center were the [[conservation movement|conservationists]], led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his coalition of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with [[Gifford Pinchot]] and used the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230&nbsp;million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi{{sup|2}} or 930,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, [[national park]]s, and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.<ref>Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt explained his position in 1910:\n\n{{quote|Conservation means development as much as it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.<ref>W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003) p.&nbsp;25</ref>}}\n\nThe third element, smallest at first but growing rapidly after 1870, were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake, and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits. Their leader was [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914), a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake, and founder of the [[Sierra Club]]. Muir, based in California, in 1889 started organizing support to preserve the [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoias]] in the [[Yosemite Valley]]; Congress did pass the [[Yosemite National Park]] bill (1890). In 1897 President [[Grover Cleveland]] created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move. Muir, taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet,<ref>Dennis C. Williams, ''God's wilds: John Muir's vision of nature'' (2002) p.&nbsp;134</ref> crusaded against the lumberman, portraying it as a contest \"between landscape righteousness and the devil\".<ref>Robert L. Dorman, ''A word for nature: four pioneering environmental advocates, 1845\u20131913'' (1998) p.&nbsp;159</ref> A master publicist, Muir's magazine articles, in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (June 5, 1897) and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' turned the tide of public sentiment.<ref>John Muir, [http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=atla;idno=atla0080-2 \"The American Forests\"]</ref> He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt's program of setting aside national monuments, national forest reserves, and national parks. However Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President [[William Howard Taft]] on the [[Hetch Hetchy]] dam, which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco. Biographer [[Donald Worster]] says, \"Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Worster|title=A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuAsAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.

Once numbering over 25&nbsp;million on the [[Great Plains]], the grass-eating herds were a vital resource animal for the [[Plains Indians]], providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction.

[[Conservation in the United States|Conservationists]] founded the [[American Bison Society]] in 1905; it lobbied Congress to establish public bison herds.

During the same period, [[P. T. Barnum]] presented Indian chiefs, dances, and other Wild West exhibits in his museums. However, large scale awareness really took off when the [[dime novel]] appeared in 1859, the first being ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter''.<ref>Robert M. Utley (2003), p.&nbsp;253</ref> By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public's attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism, and fixed in the public's mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains\u2014courageous cowboys and savage Indians, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days. The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S. Ellis' ''Seth Jones'' (1860). [[Ned Buntline]]'s stories glamorized [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Edward Lytton Wheeler|Edward L. Wheeler]] created \"[[Deadwood Dick]]\", \"Hurricane Nell\", and \"Calamity Jane\".<ref>Howard R. Lamar (1977), pp.&nbsp;303\u2013304</ref>\n\nBuffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U.S. and Europe. He presented the first \"Wild West\" show in 1883, featuring a recreation of famous battles (especially Custer's Last Stand), expert marksmanship, and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and Indians, as well as sure-shooting [[Annie Oakley]].<ref>Joy S.

Cowboy, Pinkerton detective, and western author, Siringo was the first authentic cowboy autobiographer. Adams spent the 1880s in the cattle industry in Texas and 1890s mining in the Rockies. When an 1898 play's portrayal of Texans outraged Adams, he started writing plays, short stories, and novels drawn from his own experiences. His ''The Log of a Cowboy'' (1903) became a classic novel about the cattle business, especially the cattle drive.<ref>{{cite book|first=Andy|last=Adams|title=The log of a cowboy: a narrative of the old trail days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ho4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PP1|year=1903|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company}}, full text</ref> It described a fictional drive of the Circle Dot herd from Texas to Montana in 1882, and became a leading source on cowboy life; historians retraced its path in the 1960s, confirming its basic accuracy.

It began in organized fashion in the West in the 1880s, when several Western cities followed up on touring Wild West shows and organized celebrations that included rodeo activities. The establishment of major cowboy competitions in the East in the 1920s led to the growth of rodeo sports. Trail cowboys who were also known as gunfighters like [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Luke Short]] and others, were known for their prowess, [[Fast draw|speed]] and skill with their pistols and other firearms. Their violent escapades and reputations morphed over time into the stereotypical image of violence endured by the \"cowboy hero\".<ref name=\"Watts\" /><ref>Jeremy Agnew, ''The Creation of the Cowboy Hero: Fiction, Film and Fact''(McFarland, 2014) pp.&nbsp;38\u201340, 88. {{ISBN|978-0786478392}}</ref><ref>Robert K.

The Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] seized upon the statistic to announce the end of the era in which the frontier process shaped the American character. When examining the later [[1900 United States Census|1900 U.S. Census]] [[c:File:Distribution_of_US_Rural_Population_during_1900.pdf|population distribution]] results though, a frontier line does still remain. But by the [[1910 United States Census|1910 U.S. Census]], only pockets of the frontier remain without a clear westward line, allowing travel across the continental United States without ever entering it possible for the first time.\n\nFresh farmland was increasingly hard to find after 1890\u2014although the railroads advertised some in eastern Montana. Bicha shows that nearly 600,000 American farmers sought cheap land by moving to the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie frontier of the Canadian West]] from 1897 to 1914.

These contained plenty of unoccupied land, as did the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Typical frontier crimes such as the [[Jarbidge Stage Robbery|last stagecoach robbery]] occurred in Nevada's remaining frontier in December 1916. [[American Indian Wars|Conflict]] between the U.S. Government, American Indians, and settlers also continued into the early 1920s, shown in events such as the [[Bluff War]] (1914\u20131915) and [[Posey War]] (1923).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSoon, the ethos and storyline of the \"American frontier\" had passed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Cloud|title=The Coming of the Frontier Press: How the West Was Really Won|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LVzRxYMIOMC&pg=PA17|year=2008|publisher=Northwestern University Press|pages=17\u201318|isbn=978-0-8101-2508-7}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\n\nScores of Turner students became professors in history departments in the western states, and taught courses on the frontier.<ref>Richard Etulain, ed.

It avoids the word \"frontier\" and stresses cultural interaction between white culture and groups such as Indians and Hispanics. History professor William Weeks of the University of San Diego argues that in this \"New Western History\" approach:\n\n{{quote|It is easy to tell who the bad guys are \u2013 they are almost invariably white, male, and middle-class or better, while the good guys are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class....

The first group emphasizes human agency on the environment; the second looks at the influence of the environment. [[William Cronon]] has argued that Turner's famous 1893 essay was environmental history in an embryonic form. It emphasized the vast power of free land to attract and reshape settlers, making a transition from wilderness to civilization.<ref>Andrew C.

He compared the effects of the railroad opening up Western lands to urban transportation systems and the automobile, and Western settlers' \"land hunger\" to poor city residents seeking social status. Just as the Republican party benefited from support from \"old\" immigrant groups that settled on frontier farms, \"new\" urban immigrants formed an important part of the Democratic [[New Deal coalition]] that began with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s victory in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]].<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | last=Lubell|first=Samuel | year=1956 | pages=65\u201368, 82\u201383 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s an active center is the history department at the [[University of New Mexico]], along with the University of New Mexico Press.

The helmet slowly began to take more of the appearance we recognize today when around 1915 more padding and flaps were added with ear holes for better on-field communication. Painted helmets have been around almost as long as helmets themselves: used to show team spirit and to help the quarterback distinguish a down field receiver from the defenders. The helmets of the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan Wolverines]] bear logos that follow the original seams of the leather helmets. Professional team logos started in 1948 when [[Fred Gehrke]], a [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] for [[1948 Los Angeles Rams season|the Los Angeles Rams]], began painting a horn design on all of the Rams' helmets. Gehrke studied art at the [[University of Utah]].\n\nThe next innovation came probably in 1917 in the form of suspension: to \"cradle\" the skull away from the foam shell. Straps of fabric formed a pattern inside the helmet. They absorbed and distributed the impact better, and they allowed for ventilation. It was a breakthrough. They were first known as \"ZH\" or Zuppke helmets named after the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] [[Robert Zuppke|coach who came up with the design]]. [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] were some of the first manufacturers.\n\nThe first person to design a bar face mask on a football helmet was Vern McMillan, the owner of a sporting goods store in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. It was a rubber-covered wire mask on a leather helmet. This kind was used in the mid-1930s.\n\n==Plastic helmets==\nThe first plastic football helmet came in 1940. It was invented and patented by John T. Riddell and his son John T. Riddell Jr., of the John T. [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Company in Chicago, a sporting goods provider. The single molded shell was stronger, lighter, longer-lasting, and did not rot the way leather does when damp. Colors could also be baked into the plastic so the paint jobs would be longer-lasting. In 1940 Riddell also developed the first chin strap to rest on the chin instead of the neck <!-- the chin strap had been resting on the Adam's apple, many thought this caused kneck injuries --> and the first plastic face mask.\n\nThere were problems however. The plastic helmets were brittle when hit head on, and the bar hole that was drilled for the face mask tended to pop loose. Because of this Riddell was in trouble and so was the plastic helmet. Riddell's plastic helmet was a little flat on top at first but it changed to its tear-drop shape, which allowed a blow to slide to one side or the other rather than be met head-on. Its web suspension could be raised or lowered to fit the head of a player.\n\nIn 1955, G.E. Morgan, a consultant to Riddell, and [[Paul Brown]], the coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]], invented the BT-5 face mask which is the single bar design. The year after the release of the BT-5, a single wave radio was invented by John Campbell and George Sarles, who approached then-Cleveland Browns owner Paul Brown to install a radio inside quarterback George Ratterman's helmet. It only resulted in game time interference, and was outlawed by then-NFL commissioner Bert Bell after only three preseason games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.profootballhof.com/news/ratterman-s-radio-helmet/ |title=Ratterman's Radio Helmet |date=2005 |website=Pro Football Hall of Fame |access-date=29 September 2019}}</ref> It wasn't until 38 years later in 1994, that the radio transmitter inside the quarterback's helmet was revisited.\n\nIn 1971, Morgan, now chairman of the board of Riddell received a patent for \"Energy Absorbing and Sizing Means for Helmets.\" The result were the new HA-91 and HA-92 energy-absorbing, \"microfit\" helmets. They had valves on their crown to allow air to be pumped into vinyl cushions that were crammed into every space inside the helmet. The player put it on and then had it pumped up to fit firmly around the player's head. Sometimes fluid was also used. An anti-freeze solvent was used by some of the [[Green Bay Packers]] players to beat the cold weather of [[Lambeau Field]] in late-season games.  \n\nSources are unsure as to who first designed air bladders for football helmets but Dr. Richard Schneider of the [[University of Michigan]] Hospital is reported to have believed that air was the most effective way to protect against blunt force. With this theory in mind, he invented an inflatable bladder for use inside a football helmet. The Michigan Wolverines Football team used a prototype and [[Schutt Sports]] hired Schnieder and started mass-producing the AirTm Helmet in the early 1970s.\n\nMany veteran players still preferred the old web suspended Riddell TK-2 because it was generally lighter and more breathable. Interior helmet pads were then developed that were lighter and did not need to be filled with air or fluid by both the Schutt and Riddell sports companies. And because of safety they were soon preferred by all positions {{source needed|date=June 2018}}.  \n\nIn late 1976, because of concern for safety, four point chin straps were required in college ball. These kept the helmet firmly in place. \n\nSpace age rigid [[polycarbonate]] alloy plastic helmets and vinyl-coated steel alloy face masks became standards in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 2002, Riddell released a new more spherical design for the helmet called the Revolution (or Revo) and it is currently the most widely used helmet in the [[National Football League]] The Schutt counterpart is called the DNA Pro Adult Helmet.

Huizenga stated his intention to aggressively pursue an expansion franchise. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]]. Orlando fielded a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park\u2014the [[Florida Suncoast Dome]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], completed in 1990.

The Marlins later retired the number 5 in honor of Barger's favorite player, [[Joe DiMaggio]], but would put the number back into circulation when they moved to the city of Miami in 2012, honoring Barger instead with a plaque at the new [[Marlins Park]].\n\nThe Marlins' first [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] was [[Rene Lachemann]], a former [[catcher]] who had previously managed the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and who at the time of his hiring was a third base coach for the [[Oakland Athletics]].

[[Jeff Conine]] went 4-4 as well, making him an immediate crowd favorite.  By the end of his tenure with Florida, he would earn the nickname \"Mr. Marlin.\" [[Gary Sheffield]] and [[Bryan Harvey]] represented the Marlins as the club's first All-Star Game selections, and Sheffield homered in the Marlins first All-Star Game at-bat. The team finished the year five games ahead of the last-place [[1993 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] and with an attendance of 3,064,847.

The team's 3.95 [[earned run average|ERA]] ranked third in the NL, thanks in large part to newcomer [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], who finished the season with a 17\u201311 win-loss record and an impressive 1.89 ERA. On May 11, [[Al Leiter]] pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in Marlins history.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/12/sports/baseball-leiter-buries-rockies-for-florida-s-first-no-hitter.html</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kenXi2pytqI</ref> Catcher Charles Johnson led the league with a .995 [[fielding percentage]], threw out a league-high 48 percent of base runners, and collected his second straight [[Gold Glove Award]] for fielding excellence. After a slow start, the Marlins finished the year with an 80\u201382 win-loss record to place third in their division. Boles returned to his previous position as director of player development, and former [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] manager [[Jim Leyland]] was hired to lead the club in {{mlby|1997}}.\n\n=== 1997: First World Series title ===\n{{Main|1997 Florida Marlins season}}\nIn addition to hiring Leyland as manager, the Marlins signed third baseman [[Bobby Bonilla]], outfielder [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], and pitcher [[Alex Fernandez (baseball)|Alex Fernandez]] to lucrative free-agent contracts, raising expectations to levels far beyond anything in franchise history.\n\nThe Marlins franchise got its second no-hitter from ace [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]] on June 10, 1997. Brown nearly had the perfect game, but he hit the Giants' [[Marvin Benard]] with a pitch in the 8th inning when Benard attempted to bunt. With Brown, Leiter, and Fernandez heading the rotation, and [[Robb Nen]] closing out games, the Marlins' staff was almost systematic during their regular season run. In 1997, the Marlins finished nine games back of the Division Champion [[Atlanta Braves]], but earned the wild card berth. Veteran additions such as LF Mois\u00e9s Alou, 3B Bobby Bonilla, and trade-deadline additions [[Darren Daulton]] and [[Jim Eisenreich]] added experience and clutch hits. Talented young stars [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]] (2B) and [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] (SS) comprised one of the best double play combos in the League. Castillo did not perform to expectations offensively, and was replaced by [[Craig Counsell]] before the playoffs began. The Marlins swept the [[1997 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] 3\u20130 in the [[1997 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]], and then went on to beat the [[1997 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] 4\u20132 in the [[1997 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], overcoming the loss of Alex Fernandez to a torn rotator cuff, and Kevin Brown to a virus. Brown's place was taken in Game 5 by rookie pitcher [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]], who had earned a spot in the rotation in the second half of the season, but was not in the rotation during the postseason. Hernandez struck out 15 Braves and outdueled multiple Cy Young Award winner [[Greg Maddux]] to a 2\u20131 victory and a 3\u20132 series lead. Brown returned to the mound for Game 6, pitching a complete game victory to secure the Marlins their first-ever National League pennant. The underdog Marlins went on to face the [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[1997 World Series]], and won in seven games. In Game 7, Craig Counsell's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth tied the game at 2, then, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 11th, \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda's soft liner glanced off the glove of Cleveland pitcher [[Charles Nagy]] and into center field to score Counsell and give the Marlins the win.\n\n==== The \"Fire Sale\" offseason====\nFollowing the World Series victory, Huizenga dismantled the team, claiming financial losses despite winning the World Series. He traded most of the club's best players in one of the biggest [[fire sale (sports)|fire sales]] in sports history. The first deal came days after the World Series, when outfielder Mois\u00e9s Alou was traded to the [[Houston Astros]] for pitchers Oscar Hernandez and [[Manuel Barrios]]. The Marlins then traded Kevin Brown to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Derrek Lee]] and 2 minor leaguers. Finally, in May 1998, they dealt Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich, and [[Manuel Barrios]] to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for [[Mike Piazza]] and [[Todd Zeile]], both of whom would be gone via trades by midseason. On the flip side, these trades brought promising youngsters [[Derrek Lee]] and [[A. J. Burnett]].\n\nThe Marlins did manage to win a second World Series just six years later in 2003.  Only one player played on both championship teams: i.e., [[Jeff Conine]], who ironically was one of the players included in the \"fire sale.\"  Conine was traded after the 1997 season to the [[Kansas City Royals]] who in turn traded him to the [[Baltimore Orioles]].  The Marlins picked up Conine in a late season trade during the 2003 pennant race.\n\n=== 1998\u20132002: Last place finishes, new ownership and front office ===\nThe Marlins slumped to 54\u2013108 in {{mlby|1998}}, the worst record in the major leagues that year, and the most losses in franchise history. They are the only team to lose 100 games a year after winning the World Series. Leyland resigned as manager in October 1998, and was replaced by John Boles. Huizenga soon sold the club to [[John W. Henry|John Henry]], a commodities trader from [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], during the off-season. The Marlins had the second overall pick in the [[1999 Major League Baseball draft|1999 draft]] and drafted [[Josh Beckett]], a high school pitcher from [[Greater Houston|the Houston area]].\n\nIn [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]], the Marlins were the first MLB team to host a game in which [[Instant replay in baseball|instant replay]] was used.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1999/05/31/cardinals_marlins/ | work=CNN | title=Marlins object to umps watching TV | date=June 1, 1999 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> While playing the [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]], [[Cliff Floyd]] hit a ball to the top of the left field scoreboard.

The Marlins also drafted P [[Johan Santana]] from Houston in the [[Rule 5 draft]] but traded him to Minnesota in a prearranged deal for P Jared Camp.\n\nA month prior to the regular season, the Marlins hired [[David Dombrowski]] as the third President in club history, making him both President and [[General manager (baseball)|General Manager]]. After posting the worst record in baseball for the 1999 season, the Marlins had the first overall pick in the [[2000 Major League Baseball draft|2000 first-year player draft]] and selected first baseman [[Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], an 18-year-old native of [[Bonita, California]]. The [[Eastlake High School (Chula Vista, California)|Eastlake High School]] product agreed to terms with the Marlins that same day. The Marlins went on that season to finish 79\u201382 and third in the NL East. This was thanks to the emergence of OF [[Preston Wilson]] who had 31 home runs and 121 RBIs. Derrek Lee and Luis Castillo broke out this year as well, as Castillo posted a .334 batting average and Lee had 28 homers in his first full season. [[Antonio Alfonseca]] posted a then-club record 45 saves.\n\nThe club slowly worked its way back to respectability with a third-place finish in 2000, driven by young stars such as [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Brad Penny]], [[Preston Wilson]], Luis Castillo, and [[Mike Lowell]]. Burnett pitched the Marlins' third no-hitter on May 12, {{mlby|2001}}, against the Padres, despite walking nine batters and throwing only half of his pitches for strikes. Three weeks after the no-no, Manager John Boles was fired and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] was named interim manager for the rest of the season. The club finished 76\u201386 and in fourth place, thanks to Brad Penny's and A. J. Burnett's emergence.\n\nThe offseason following the 2001 regular season included an overhaul of the ownership and front office. Tony P\u00e9rez resigned and returned to his previous role as the front-office Baseball Operations assistant. About a month later, David Dombrowski resigned as President and General Manager of the Florida Marlins and accepted the position as President of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Entering the new year, Henry sold the Marlins to [[Montreal Expos]] owner [[Jeffrey Loria]], clearing the way for Henry to buy the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Loria brought the entire Expos management and coaching staff to the Marlins. David Samson became team president, [[Larry Beinfest]] became General Manager and [[Jeff Torborg]] became manager.\n\nPrior to the 2002 season, the Marlins traded RHP [[Matt Clement]] and RHP [[Antonio Alfonseca]] to the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] for RHP [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]], LHP [[Dontrelle Willis]], RHP Jose Cueto and C Ryan Jorgensen. The Marlins had their ups as Luis Castillo had a team record 35-game hitting streak and [[Kevin Millar]] had a 25-game hit streak. Around the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break they made their second big trade, sending OF Cliff Floyd to the Expos for RHP [[Carl Pavano]], RHP Justin Wayne, INF [[Mike Mordecai]], LHP Graeme Lloyd, RHP Don Levinski and INF Wilton Guerrero. The same day, the Fish dealt RHP [[Ryan Dempster]] to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for OF [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and LHP Ryan Snare. The Marlins finished 79\u201383, the second-best season in team history up to that time, but their fifth straight losing season since winning the World Series.\n\nThe Marlins also turned their first ever [[triple play]] in franchise history on July 28, 2002.\n\n=== 2003\u20132005: The 1st Jack McKeon era and Second World Championship===\n[[File:Jack_McKeon_and_George_W._Bush.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Members of the 2003 Florida Marlins championship team with [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] after their win.]]\n\n==== 2003: Second World Series victory ====\n{{Main|2003 Florida Marlins season}}\nDuring the offseason, the Marlins signed free agent catcher [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]] \u2013 a 10-time [[Gold Glove Award]] winner \u2013 and acquired speedy outfielder [[Juan Pierre]] from the [[Colorado Rockies]] hoping to offset the loss of sluggers [[Cliff Floyd]] and [[Preston Wilson]]. The Marlins did acquire P [[Mike Hampton]] but dealt him and his hefty contract to the Braves for P [[Tim Spooneybarger]].\n\nThe Marlins struggled in the opening stages of the season, going 16\u201322. During that span, Florida lost its top three pitchers: [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Josh Beckett]], and [[Mark Redman]]. On May 11, Florida replaced manager Jeff Torborg with 72-year-old [[Jack McKeon]]. On May 22, the Marlins hit bottom with a major league worst record of 19\u201329, having lost 6 straight games. However, help was on the way.\n\nOn May 9, the Marlins called up high-kicking southpaw [[Dontrelle Willis]] from the Double-A [[Carolina Mudcats (1991\u20132011)|Carolina Mudcats]] and helped carry the injury-plagued Marlins with an 11\u20132 record in his first 17 starts. [[Miguel Cabrera]] (also from the Mudcats) filled in well, hitting a walk off home run in his first major league game, against the [[2003 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] at [[Pro Player Stadium]]. Both Willis and Cabrera would later prove to be essential parts of the Marlin's playoff success. [[Jeff Conine]] \u2013 an original Marlin and member of the 1997 World Series team \u2013 returned from [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]], and closer [[Ugueth Urbina]] arrived from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. These acquisitions helped to keep the team in contention, and although they finished ten games behind the Braves, the Marlins captured the NL wild card.\n\nThe Marlins won the [[2003 National League Division Series|Division Series]] against the favored [[2003 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] three games to one. The series ended with a dramatic collision between Marlins catcher Rodr\u00edguez and Giants first baseman [[J. T. Snow]], making it the first postseason series ever to end with the potential tying run being thrown out at the plate. It was the second time that the Marlins defeated the Giants in the Division Series, having done so in 1997.\n\nOn October 15, the Marlins defeated the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] four games to three in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|Championship Series]], coming back from a three games to one deficit. A Beckett complete-game [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] in Game 5 kept the Marlins alive. Game 6 saw the Marlins play a role in one of baseball's most infamous moments: \"[[2003 National League Championship Series|The Inning]]\" . With 1 one out in the 8th inning and the Cubs 3 runs ahead, Marlins 2nd baseman Luis Castillo hit a pop foul a row into the stands along the third base line. Cubs fan [[Steve Bartman]] reached for the ball, preventing Cubs LF Mois\u00e9s Alou from making the out and setting off an 8-run Marlins rally. The incident with [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]] and a come-from-behind win in [[Wrigley Field]] in Game 7 helped the Marlins capture their second NL pennant, keeping the \"[[Curse of the Billy Goat]]\" alive and well.\n\nIn the [[2003 World Series]], the Marlins defeated the heavily favored [[2003 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in six games, winning the sixth game in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Shortstop [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (shortstop, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] helped the Marlins in Game 4 of the series with a walk off home run in extra innings. Josh Beckett was named the Most Valuable Player for the series after twirling a five-hit complete-game shutout in Game 6. Skipper Jack McKeon became the oldest manager ever to win a World Series title. The Marlins became the first opposing team to win a Series championship on the field at Yankee Stadium since [[1981 World Series|1981]], when the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] did it. The Marlins are also the last team to win a World Series at the original Yankee Stadium; the Yankees themselves would not participate in another World Series until [[2009 World Series|2009]], when they defeated the then-defending champion [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] at [[Yankee Stadium|the new Yankee Stadium]]. The Marlins won the series despite scoring fewer runs (17) than the Yankees (21).\n\n==== 2004: Winning season, but no repeat ====\n{{Main|2004 Florida Marlins season}}\nThe offseason after their second World Series title, the Marlins made a questionable cost-cutting move as [[Derrek Lee]] was traded to [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Hee-seop Choi]] and pitcher Mike Nannini. The Marlins also lost key parts of their second championship team, [[Ugueth Urbina]] and [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]] left via free agency (signed by the [[Detroit Tigers]]). Marlins third base coach [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] also departed to be manager of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. The Marlins did get good news though as [[Dontrelle Willis]] was named [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|NL Rookie of the Year]] and Jack McKeon named [[Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]].  They also signed Mike Lowell to a new four-year contract.\n\nAfter winning the 2003 World Series, the Marlins entered 2004 with high hopes and a retooled roster. Retaining a core of stars from their title team and hoping that newly acquired 1B [[Hee-seop Choi]] would emerge, the Marlins fell short of reaching the postseason, but they posted the third winning season in franchise history, boasting an 83\u201379 record. During the season, the Marlins were to make one of the biggest trades in club history as Los Angeles got P [[Brad Penny]], 1B Choi and Double-A left-hander [[Bill Murphy (baseball)|Bill Murphy]] in exchange for P [[Guillermo Mota]], C [[Paul Lo Duca]] and OF [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]]. Pitchers [[Carl Pavano]] and [[Armando Ben\u00edtez]] turned in record-setting performances. Pavano went 18\u20138 with a 3.30 ERA, and his 18 wins established a season high by a Marlin. Benitez became the club's season saves leader with 47 (in 51 saves attempts). Pavano, Benitez, Mike Lowell and [[Miguel Cabrera]] each enjoyed All-Star seasons, with Cabrera belting 33 homers (second-most ever in a season by a Marlin) while driving in 112 runs.\n\n==== 2005 ====\n{{Main|2005 Florida Marlins season}}\n\n=====September collapse =====\nWhile losing All-Stars [[Carl Pavano]] and [[Armando Ben\u00edtez]] in the off-season, the Marlins signed [[pitcher|P]] Al Leiter and [[first baseman|1B]] [[Carlos Delgado]]. Delgado's contract was the biggest in franchise history at $52 million over 4 years, with an option for a fifth year. Meanwhile, play-by-play TV broadcaster [[Len Kasper]] was also lost to the Chicago Cubs and replaced by [[Rich Waltz]] (who had previously been with the [[Seattle Mariners]]), and radio announcer [[Jon Sciambi|John \"Boog\" Sciambi]] was replaced by [[Roxy Bernstein]].\n\nWith the addition of Delgado, many sportswriters expected the Marlins to finish the {{Baseball Year|2005}} [[2005 Major League Baseball season|season]] in either first or second place in the NL East. However, at the All-Star break they were 44\u201342, and the NL East was unusually competitive, as all five of its teams had a winning record at the break. While Cabrera, Willis, and several others posted very good first-half numbers, Lowell was one of the least productive regular major-league starters, and Leiter went 3\u20137 with an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 6.64 before being traded to the New York Yankees on July 15 for a player to be named later. Additionally, [[Guillermo Mota]], who was acquired by Florida in 2004 along with [[Paul Lo Duca]] and [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and was expected to be their closer, was inconsistent, and the Marlins gave the closer job to veteran [[Todd Jones]], whom they signed in the offseason. However, the Marlins did send four players to the All-Star Game (Willis, Lo Duca, Castillo, and Cabrera), tying a team record.\n\nThe club was expected to be quite active at the trading deadline (July 31), as Burnett was slated to be a free agent after the season and had already declared his desire to test the market like Pavano did. Burnett was mentioned in possible trades with the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, [[New York Yankees]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and Texas Rangers, with many rumors also including Lowell or Encarnacion. The Marlins did not make a huge move at the deadline, instead trading minor-leaguer [[Yorman Bazardo]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for left-handed pitcher [[Ron Villone]].\n\nThe Marlins did have some pleasant surprises during the season. [[Dontrelle Willis]] became the 13th member of the [[Black Aces]] when he defeated the [[2005 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]] to earn his 20th win. He finished the season 22\u201310 with a 2.63 ERA, and he was considered a favorite to win the [[Cy Young Award]] for much of the season. Also, Jones, a journeyman who had been signed as a setup man, had one of the best years of his career as a closer; he earned 40 [[save (baseball)|saves]] and had a 2.13 ERA. In addition, late-season call up [[Jeremy Hermida]], a highly regarded prospect who has been compared to the Atlanta Braves' [[Jeff Francoeur]], hit a pinch-hit grand slam in his first major-league at-bat and a game-tying two-run homer in the last game of the season.\n\nThe Marlins led the NL wild-card race as late as September 13, then lost 12 of their next 14 games. The Marlins closed the season by sweeping the Braves, and their final record for the season stood at 83\u201379. After the season, lingering stadium issues forced the Marlins to ponder big moves with their roster and also ponder possible relocation to another city.\n\n===== The \"Market Correction\" offseason =====\nThe 2005 offseason would prove to be one of busiest for the Marlins in years. It began with Jack McKeon announcing his retirement on October 2 after the Marlins' last game of the season. Former [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] manager [[Lou Piniella]], Braves third base coach [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] (who previously managed in the Marlins' farm system), [[New York Yankees]] bench coach [[Joe Girardi]], and even Yankees manager [[Joe Torre]] who most thought could have been let go after a short stint postseason, were named as possible replacements for McKeon.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051002&content_id=1235159&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> On October 19, Girardi was hired as the new manager.

Pitching coach [[Mark Wiley (baseball)|Mark Wiley]] and bullpen coach [[Luis Dorante]] came under fire during the season due to the late-season struggles of Burnett and the season-long struggles of the Marlins' bullpen. Similarly, hitting coach [[Bill Robinson (outfielder)|Bill Robinson]] was often blamed for the Marlins' offensive woes throughout the season, and in particular for his failure to get Pierre and Lowell out of season-long slumps. Girardi hired [[Jim Presley]] as a replacement for Robinson, and also hired [[Rick Kranitz]] as the new pitching coach and [[Bobby Meacham]] as the new third-base coach.\n\nOn October 3, the first day after the end of the regular season, the Marlins made their first offseason moves, releasing relief pitchers [[John Riedling]] and [[Tim Spooneybarger]]. Riedling had a 4\u20131 record and a 7.14 ERA during the season; Spooneybarger, who had not played since 2003 due to rehabilitation from [[Tommy John surgery]], had to have the surgery a second time during the season and missed the {{mlby|2006|disp=seas}} as well. [[Screwball]] specialist [[Jim Mecir]] retired following the Marlins' last game of the season.\n\nCloser [[Todd Jones]], pitchers [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Brian Moehler]], [[Ismael Vald\u00e9z]], [[Paul Quantrill]], first baseman [[Jeff Conine]], infielder [[Lenny Harris]], outfielder [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]], and shortstop [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (shortstop, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] were among the Marlins' players whose contracts expired following the 2005 season. Burnett signed a five-year deal with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] worth $55 million and Jones signed for two years with the [[Detroit Tigers]], while Moehler elected to remain with the Marlins. The team declined to offer arbitration to Conine, Vald\u00e9z, Quantrill, Encarnaci\u00f3n, [[Damion Easley]], and [[Mike Mordecai]], effectively ending their tenures with the club.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051207&content_id=1278816&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Soon after announcing a plan to relocate (see below), the Marlins started to shed payroll by dealing their highest-paid players for minor league prospects, in a series of moves reminiscent of the \"fire sale\" in the 1997 offseason.

The trade left Dontrelle Willis as the only remaining member of the team's 2005 Opening Day rotation. The Marlins filled most of the remaining rotation spots with young pitchers such as [[Jason Vargas]], [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], and [[Scott Olsen]], all of whom they had recalled from their [[Carolina Mudcats (1991\u20132011)|Class AA affiliate]] during the 2005 season.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051125&content_id=1272277&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn November 23, the Mets and the Marlins agreed on a deal to move Carlos Delgado to the Mets for first baseman [[Mike Jacobs (first baseman)|Mike Jacobs]] and pitching prospect [[Yusmeiro Petit]]. Also, the Marlins would have to pay $7 million of Delgado's remaining contract. When the deal was made official the next day, the Marlins also received minor-league infielder Grant Psomas. According to the ''[[Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]'', the Marlins passed up the Mets' offer to give them center fielder [[Lastings Milledge]], who was at the time ranked the Mets' top prospect according to ''[[Baseball America]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/931114551.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+24%2C+2005&author=Juan+C.+Rodriguez+Staff+Writer&pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&edition=&startpage=1.C&desc=DELGADO+JOINS+EXODUS+METS+GET+SLUGGER+FOR+TWO+PROSPECTS |title=Delgado Joins Exodus Mets Get Slugger For Two Prospects |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2005-11-24 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref> Combined, the two trades allowed the Marlins to reduce their 2006 payroll by $27 million.\n\nHowever, the Marlins were not yet done reducing payroll. [[Paul Lo Duca]] was traded to the Mets for two players to be named later, with the Marlins sending pitcher [[Gabriel Hernandez (baseball)|Gabriel Hernandez]] and outfielder [[Dante Brinkley]] to New York to complete the deal. Longtime second baseman Luis Castillo was traded to the Twins for pitchers [[Travis Bowyer]] and [[Scott Tyler (baseball)|Scott Tyler]], and [[Juan Pierre]] to the Cubs for pitchers [[Sergio Mitre]], [[Ricky Nolasco]], and [[Renyel Pinto]]. Of the seven players that the Marlins acquired in these three deals, only Mitre and Bowyer had any major-league experience when they came to the Marlins. To replace Castillo, the Marlins signed veteran [[Pokey Reese]], but Reese was released during spring training after going [[AWOL]], and was replaced by [[Dan Uggla]], who had been selected from the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the [[Rule 5 draft]]. Uggla played in the Arizona organization at the Class AA level in 2005.\n\n=== 2006\u20132011: Smaller payrolls, managerial changes, and new stars emerge ===\n\n==== 2006: Rebuilding ====\n{{Main|2006 Florida Marlins season}}\n[[File:IMG 1220 2006FloridaMarlins.jpg|right|thumb|300px|2006 Rebuilt Marlins taking the field in front of a sparse crowd.

Not only was it the lowest team salary in all of MLB, but New York Yankees third baseman [[Alex Rodriguez]] alone made more money than the entire Marlins team. The Marlins made MLB history when they started six rookies in their Opening Day lineup.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060403&content_id=1382105&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Sporting the league's youngest team, the Marlins were predicted before the season to lose more than 100 games. Instead, the youthful squad greatly exceeded expectations, often in historical fashion. After getting off to an 11\u201331 start, the Marlins found themselves at 73\u201372 on September 12, making them the first team in the modern baseball era to improve to better than .500 after being as much as 20 games under .500. Also, for the first time in MLB history, four rookies topped double digits in wins: Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen, Ricky Nolasco and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez.\n\nOn September 6, 2006, Sanchez threw the fourth no-hitter in franchise history, beating Arizona, 2\u20130, at Dolphin Stadium. Miguel Cabrera finished second in the N.L. in batting average, and set a franchise season mark with his .339 average. [[Dan Uggla]] became the first Rule 5 pick to be selected to the All-Star Game in the season in which he was drafted and won Sporting News Rookie of the Year for the National League and won the Players' Choice award as the league's most outstanding rookie. [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] won the N.L. Rookie of the Year Award, and [[Joe Girardi]] was voted N.L. Manager of the Year. Dan Uggla finished third in the voting and starting pitcher [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], fourth; starting pitchers [[Scott Olsen]] and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and left fielder [[Josh Willingham]] received one third-place vote each.\n\nAdditionally, the Marlins had four of their rookie starting pitchers (An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], [[Scott Olsen]], and [[Ricky Nolasco]]) win at least ten games, becoming the first team in major-league history to do so. The 2006 Marlins also had five ten-game winners for the first time in franchise history (including Dontrelle Willis).\n\nShortly after the 2006 season ended and following months of speculation, Marlins manager [[Joe Girardi]] was fired on October 3, 2006 not long after winning the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] award. This was due to a game against the [[2006 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] earlier in the year in which Girardi did not challenge a call that pitcher [[Taylor Tankersley]] thought was a strike and this prompted owner Jeffrey Loria, who was in the stands and a few feet away from the dugout, to call out Girardi who refused to listen to him. This wasn't the only thing that triggered the feud; earlier in the year Girardi reportedly wanted 1B Mike Jacobs to start off the year in triple A, Willingham to start at catcher, Miguel Cabrera to start at first base.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061115&content_id=1740979&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Within hours, Atlanta Braves third base coach [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named his replacement and was signed to a three-year contract.\n\n==== 2007: Injuries deplete the Fish ====\n{{Main|2007 Florida Marlins season}}\nAfter a 2006 season which saw them defy expectations time and again, the Marlins entered 2007 hanging on to the belief that they could compete with anyone. It didn't turn out that way. Injuries ravaged the starting rotation and the Marlins struggled all season, ultimately finishing in last place in the National League East for the first time since 1999. Josh Johnson underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez had right shoulder surgery. [[Ricky Nolasco]] dealt with a sore elbow all season. Suddenly, the strength of the team\u2014the starting rotation\u2014was minus three key players. Despite a disappointing finish, there certainly were a number of highs\u2014Kevin Gregg emerged as a dominant closer, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] developed into a legitimate superstar and [[Miguel Cabrera]] proved why he already was one\u2014but none of them could ultimately overcome the odds heavily stacked against the Marlins. On the downside, southpaws [[Dontrelle Willis]] and [[Scott Olsen]] had disappointing campaigns. What was encouraging was an otherwise disappointing season ended on a high note. The team won five of six to end the season (sweeping the Cubs and taking two of three with the Mets at Shea Stadium). Still, after the season, the franchise went in a different direction. The year was capped by the trading of their two biggest stars, slugger [[Miguel Cabrera]] and pitcher [[Dontrelle Willis]]. Talks with both the [[Los Angeles Angels]] and [[San Francisco Giants]] fell apart. On December 5, 2007, the Marlins agreed to the terms of a trade with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The trade would surprisingly send not only Cabrera, but also Willis, to the Tigers. In return, the Marlins did not receive four players, but six. The Marlins received center fielder [[Cameron Maybin]], catcher [[Mike Rabelo]], and pitchers [[Andrew Miller (baseball)|Andrew Miller]], [[Eulogio De La Cruz]], [[Burke Badenhop]], and [[Dallas Trahern]].\n\nThe Marlins did have some bright spots on offense as they set club records for runs scored (790), hits (1,504), doubles (340), home runs (201), RBIs (749) and slugging percentage (.448). As the Marlins wrapped up the season they announced that pitching coach Rick Kranitz would not be back with the club and extended Larry Beinfest and [[Michael Hill (baseball)|Michael Hill]] to long-term deals that run through 2015 along with promotions to President of Baseball Operations and Vice President/General Manager, respectively.,<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/591/story/249352.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3041984 |title=Marlins give extensions to Beinfest, other front office executives \u2013 MLB \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==== 2008: Back to .500 baseball ====\n{{Main|2008 Florida Marlins season}}\nThe Marlins began 2008 on a positive note. Analysts expected a lackluster performance on the field, citing the low payroll and loss of [[Dontrelle Willis]] and [[Miguel Cabrera]] during the offseason. However, the Marlins got off to one of the best starts in team history. At one point the Marlins were 30\u201320, the first time since September 14, 2005 the team had been 10 games over .500. They jumped atop of the [[National League East]] in April and May, the first time since 2002 that they held the lead that late in the season. The good start was attributed to powerful offensive production from their core of Mike Jacobs, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]], [[Dan Uggla]], [[Josh Willingham]], and [[Jorge Cant\u00fa]] and quality pitching by [[southpaw]] [[Scott Olsen]] and right-hander [[Ricky Nolasco]]. The Marlins' hot start made them a rare buyer at the July trade deadline, where they were involved in talks on a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and Boston Red Sox which could have brought [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] to South Florida. The Marlins backed out at the last second when trade talks turned to their coveted power-hitting prospect, [[Giancarlo Stanton]]. Instead, Manny Ram\u00edrez ended up with the Dodgers and the Marlins wound up trading for [[Arthur Rhodes]].\n\n[[File:Hanley Ramirez.jpg|thumb|left|Ram\u00edrez (left) leading off first against the [[2008 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in 2008.]]The team also received encouraging news when injured pitcher [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]] made a fast recovery from Tommy John surgery and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez came back from a torn labrum in the shoulder, both leaping into the rotation right away along with newly called up prized prospect [[Chris Volstad]]. In addition, the Marlins sent two players, Hanley Ram\u00edrez, who started the game at shortstop, and reserve [[Dan Uggla]] to the last [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Marlins signed [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] to a 6-year, $70 million deal, making him the richest Marlin in history.\n\nThe team struggled in the month of August, when they went 11\u201316 due to lack of the offense they had in the early part of the season. In September, the Marlins rallied with a nine-game winning streak, tying the franchise record, thanks in part to prized prospect, Cameron Maybin. However they lost four straight afterwards and were eliminated from playoff contention, although but they did manage to eliminate the [[2008 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] for the second consecutive season on the final day, winning the final game at [[Shea Stadium]], 4\u20132.\n\nThe team finished with a franchise record for most home runs in a season at 208. Mike Jacobs, Dan Uggla, Hanley Ram\u00edrez and Jorge Cant\u00fa made MLB history by becoming the first foursome of infielders to hit at least 25 homers in a season. Just a day after the [[2008 World Series|World Series]] concluded, the Marlins began wheeling and dealing. They traded first baseman Mike Jacobs to the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]] for reliever [[Leo N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], who the Marlins hoped could become a setup-man in late innings. A few weeks later, the Marlins traded power hitting outfielder [[Josh Willingham]] and southpaw [[Scott Olsen]] to the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]] for utility player [[Emilio Bonifacio]] and two minor leaguers. Soon after the Marlins traded closer Kevin Gregg to the Cubs for relief prospect Jos\u00e9 Ceda.\n\n==== 2009: Falling short ====\n{{Main|2009 Florida Marlins season}}\nA few weeks before the regular season, the Florida Marlins' 15-year quest for a permanent home became a reality by agreeing to bankroll a big share of a $634 million stadium complex to rise on the grounds of the old [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] site. The Marlins hoped to open at the new stadium on Opening Day 2012 with a new name of '''Miami Marlins'''.\n\nThe Marlins kicked off the new season with the youngest team in baseball and with the lowest payroll for the fourth consecutive season. New leadoff man [[Emilio Bonifacio]] stole the show on Opening Day. He hit the first [[Opening Day]] [[inside-the-park home run]] since [[Carl Yastrzemski]] did it for the Boston Red Sox in [[1968 Major League Baseball season|1968]] and had three stolen bases to go along with four hits. Hanley Ram\u00edrez hit his first career [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] as the Marlins went on to score 12 runs, the most ever in franchise history on Opening Day.\n\nThe Marlins started the 2009 season hot by sweeping the [[2009 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]], only the second time they started the season with sweep since the 1997 Marlins team. The Marlins won their first four games for the first time in franchise history and started 11\u20131, which included 2 out of 3 wins from the [[2009 New York Mets season|Mets]], the first Marlins franchise sweep at [[Turner Field]], and three comeback late-inning wins against the Nationals in Washington, sweeping the teams' second series matchup. The 11\u20131 start was the best start in Marlins history. They then lost their next seven games starting with the 62-99 [[2009 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] making them the first team in NL history to win seven straight games then lose the next seven. But even though they were below .500 by as many as five games, they rebounded to 2 games above .500 as of July 1, 2009. Cody Ross, the leader of the rebound, hit 2 grand slams in 2 weeks. The Marlins also amazed many in the final series before the All-Star break against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Originally trailing by seven runs after five innings, the Marlins entered the eighth inning down 7\u20134, they sent 14 batters to the plate. In the benchmark frame, they collected eight hits, and had eight different players score for a total of ten runs in the inning. In all the Marlins collected 14 unanswered runs as they came back for their 21st come from behind victory of the season. After the first 100 games of the season they stood second in the NL East with a record of 52\u201348.\n\nComing out of the All-Star break, the Marlins were swept in three games by the Phillies, but they responded by sweeping the Padres in San Diego before taking two of three against the Dodgers. That 5-1 West Coast road trip\u2014from July 20\u201326\u2014reinforced to management that the team was in contention. Instead of being sellers at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline, first baseman Nick Johnson was acquired from the Nationals for pitching prospect Aaron Thompson, in the hopes that Johnson would bring his renowned plate discipline to the forefront of the Marlins' lineup. However other rumors began to surface that the team was exploring options in deals that would bring major players to Florida, including superstars [[Roy Halladay]] and [[Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], as well as closer [[Heath Bell]].\n\nIn August, the Marlins offense would take off. Rookie [[Chris Coghlan]] set a club record with ten consecutive multihit games. In addition, the Marlins would set a team record with 14 consecutive games with 10 or more hits, becoming the first team since the 1937 [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] to reach that milestone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090815&content_id=6438608&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Marlins reach 12 straight with 10-plus hits &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref><ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090809&content_id=6329896&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> August would also see the Marlins sweeping the division leading [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after getting swept by the division cellar [[Washington Nationals]].

However, the status of [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] for the 2010 season was put in question when a report by [[ESPN]]'s [[Buster Olney]] said the Marlins had made contact with [[Bobby Valentine]]. The Marlins put those rumors to rest days later confirming that the all-time winningest manager in franchise history would remain at the helm. On the other hand, pitching coach [[Mark Wiley (baseball)|Mark Wiley]] and infield/first-base coach [[Andy Fox]] were not retained.\n\nSoon after the World Series, the Marlins began their off-season.  On November 5, Jeremy Hermida was dealt to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for 2 prospects, pitchers [[Hunter Jones]] and [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez (baseball, born 1989)|Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez]].  The team also saw a higher number of awards handed out to the team, as Ramirez notched his second straight Silver Slugger award, and [[Chris Coghlan]] was named the [[National League Rookie of the Year]].

Marlins owner [[Jeffrey Loria]] expressed high hopes saying, \"I expect us to make the playoffs, we've got all the ammunition we need.\"\n\nHowever, those aspirations proved to be misplaced, as little went right in Miami. In mid-May, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] was suspended for a game by manager Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez for not hustling towards a fly ball which cost the team runs and a loss. Nearly two weeks later, Roy Halladay threw a perfect game against Florida, which was the first one thrown against the Marlins in franchise history.\n\nOn June 23, with the team sitting at 34-36 along with having a shaky bullpen and inconsistent situational hitting and bench, Loria decided to fire [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] along with bench coach [[Carlos Tosca]] and hitting coach [[Jim Presley]] on June 23. At the time of his dismissal, Gonz\u00e1lez's record for the season was 32\u201334. Edwin Rodriguez was promoted from Triple-A [[New Orleans Zephyrs|New Orleans]] as Florida's new manager. Sandwiched between those two announcements were talks with former Rangers and Mets manager [[Bobby Valentine]] but those talks broke down. Edwin Rodriguez's first game was a June 23 win against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\nOther disappointments came in the way of injuries to core players, Chris Coghlan, the 2009 NL Rookie of the Year, tore the meniscus in his left knee while jamming a shaving-cream pie in Wes Helms' face. Ricky Nolasco tore the meniscus in his right knee when he took off a shoe. When all was said and done, a club-record 57 players rotated through the clubhouse.\n\nAt the All-Star Break, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] participated in the [[State Farm]] [[Home Run Derby]] and became the first Marlin to reach the finals. Ramirez lost to [[David Ortiz]] but set a Marlins record for most home runs hit in the Derby with 26.\n\nAfter the All-Star Break, the Marlins went on a surge, getting off to an 11\u20135 start thanks in large part to [[Dan Uggla]], who also set a Marlins franchise record for total home runs at 144, passing Mike Lowell. In that same week (July 19-July 25), the Marlins had four walk-off base hits, two by Donnie Murphy and one each from [[Ronny Paulino]] and [[Wes Helms]]. It was that week which brought up the need to be buyers at the trade deadline. Considered in contention for the playoffs, the Marlins traded [[Rick VandenHurk]] to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for lefty [[Will Ohman]] to shore up a shaky bullpen.\n\nThe second half also saw the emergence of rookie outfielders [[Giancarlo Stanton|Michael Stanton]] and [[Logan Morrison]], who replaced the injured Chris Coghlan. Rookie first baseman Gaby S\u00e1nchez also put up good numbers, at the top of most lists in home runs, RBIs, and batting average, to contend for the NL Rookie of the Year award.\n\nThe Marlins 2010 season was considered a disappointment, as they finished under .500 for the first time since 2007.\n\n===== Off-season changes =====\nSoon after the World Series, the team began its offseason on trying to improve its defense and bullpen while filling a dire need at catcher. Out of the gate, the Florida Marlins became one of the most active teams on the market. After retaining [[Edwin Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)|Edwin Rodr\u00edguez]] and bringing back defensive guru Perry Hill, the team traded the disappointing results of the notorious [[Miguel Cabrera]]\u2013[[Dontrelle Willis]] trade.  Andrew Miller was the first to go when he was traded to the Boston Red Sox on November 12 in exchange for another lefty, [[Dustin Richardson]], a relief pitcher.  The next day, the team shipped out young center fielder Cameron Maybin to the [[San Diego Padres]] for relief pitchers [[Ryan Webb]] and [[Edward Mujica]] to help in the expected overhaul of the team's disappointing bullpen.\n\nAs soon as the season ended, the team began negotiations for a long-term deal that would keep All-Star second baseman [[Dan Uggla]] with the team.  After rejecting the team's offer of $48 million over four years because of his desire for a fifth year totaling $71 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/marlins/commentary-cut-rate-marlins-cut-loose-another-producer-1052871.html |title=Commentary: Cut-rate Florida Marlins cut loose Dan Uggla in favor |work=Palm Beach Post |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref> the team reached a stalemate with Uggla, meaning his days with the team were numbered.  Days later on November 16, in order to get some kind of return for Uggla, the team dealt him to their divisional rivals, the Atlanta Braves, for fellow All-Star and utility man [[Omar Infante]] and relief pitcher [[Michael Dunn (baseball)|Mike Dunn]].\n\nEarlier in that same day, the team came to terms on a three-year deal with All-Star catcher [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]], formerly of the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. With even more money left to spend, the team later signed free agent pitcher [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]] to a one-year, $7 million contract which had a no-trade clause. It signaled a change in the philosophy of the franchise who hadn't made such a free agent signing since 2005 when they had signed Carlos Delgado to a multi-year contract.\n\nThe team wasn't done yet, as they signed yet another of their current players to an extension.  [[Ricky Nolasco]] agreed to a three-year deal that would pay him $26.5 million through 2013, making him one of five players on the roster with a multi-year contract (the others being [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]], [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]], and [[Randy Choate]]).\n\n===2011: Short-lived resurgence ===\n{{Main|2011 Florida Marlins season}}\nAfter the Marlins began the season with the best start in franchise history through 50 games (30\u201320), they had one of the worst runs in MLB history. Starting the month of June with a .053 winning percentage (1\u201318), manager [[Edwin Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)|Edwin Rodr\u00edguez]] resigned, and the Marlins hired former manager and special assistant to the GM [[Jack McKeon]]. The Marlins finished the month at a franchise worst 5\u201323, but began July at 10\u20134. The Marlins dropped from the second-best record in the [[National League]] to last place in the National League East.

Huizenga stated his intention to aggressively pursue an expansion franchise. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]]. Orlando fielded a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park\u2014the [[Florida Suncoast Dome]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], completed in 1990.

Later that year Marlins President [[Carl Barger]] collapsed and died at the baseball [[winter meetings]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The Marlins later retired the number 5 in honor of Barger's favorite player, [[Joe DiMaggio]], but would put the number back into circulation when they moved to the city of Miami in 2012, honoring Barger instead with a plaque at the new [[Marlins Park]].\n\nThe Marlins' first [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] was [[Rene Lachemann]], a former [[catcher]] who had previously managed the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and who at the time of his hiring was a third base coach for the [[Oakland Athletics]]. The team drafted its initial lineup of players in the [[1992 MLB Expansion Draft]]. The [[1993 Florida Marlins season|Marlins]] defeated the [[1993 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] 12\u20138 in their inaugural Spring training game. Jeff Conine hit Florida's first homer before a crowd of 6,696 at the Cocoa Expo Sports Complex. The Marlins won their first game on April 5, {{Baseball Year|1993}}, against the [[1993 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]. [[Charlie Hough]] was the starting pitcher for that game. [[Jeff Conine]] went 4-4 as well, making him an immediate crowd favorite.  By the end of his tenure with Florida, he would earn the nickname \"Mr. Marlin.\" [[Gary Sheffield]] and [[Bryan Harvey]] represented the Marlins as the club's first All-Star Game selections, and Sheffield homered in the Marlins first All-Star Game at-bat. The team finished the year five games ahead of the last-place [[1993 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] and with an attendance of 3,064,847. In that season, the Marlins traded their young set-up reliever [[Trevor Hoffman]] and two minor-league prospects to the [[San Diego Padres]] for third baseman [[Gary Sheffield]]. While Sheffield helped Florida immediately and became an all-star, Hoffman eventually emerged as the best closer in the [[National League]]. After the [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993 season]], Donald A. Smiley was named the second President in club history. The [[1994 Florida Marlins season|Marlins]] finished last (51\u201364) in their division in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]-shortened season of {{mlby|1994}} and fourth (67-76) in {{mlby|1995}}. Lachemann was replaced as manager midway through the {{mlby|1996|disp=seas}} by director of player development [[John Boles, Jr.|John Boles]].\n\nThe Marlins had some bright spots on the mound and behind the plate in 1996. The team's 3.95 [[earned run average|ERA]] ranked third in the NL, thanks in large part to newcomer [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], who finished the season with a 17\u201311 win-loss record and an impressive 1.89 ERA. On May 11, [[Al Leiter]] pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in Marlins history.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/12/sports/baseball-leiter-buries-rockies-for-florida-s-first-no-hitter.html</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kenXi2pytqI</ref> Catcher Charles Johnson led the league with a .995 [[fielding percentage]], threw out a league-high 48 percent of base runners, and collected his second straight [[Gold Glove Award]] for fielding excellence. After a slow start, the Marlins finished the year with an 80\u201382 win-loss record to place third in their division. Boles returned to his previous position as director of player development, and former [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] manager [[Jim Leyland]] was hired to lead the club in {{mlby|1997}}.\n\n=== 1997: First World Series title ===\n{{Main|1997 Florida Marlins season}}\nIn addition to hiring Leyland as manager, the Marlins signed third baseman [[Bobby Bonilla]], outfielder [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], and pitcher [[Alex Fernandez (baseball)|Alex Fernandez]] to lucrative free-agent contracts, raising expectations to levels far beyond anything in franchise history.\n\nThe Marlins franchise got its second no-hitter from ace [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]] on June 10, 1997. Brown nearly had the perfect game, but he hit the Giants' [[Marvin Benard]] with a pitch in the 8th inning when Benard attempted to bunt. With Brown, Leiter, and Fernandez heading the rotation, and [[Robb Nen]] closing out games, the Marlins' staff was almost systematic during their regular season run. In 1997, the Marlins finished nine games back of the Division Champion [[Atlanta Braves]], but earned the wild card berth. Veteran additions such as LF Mois\u00e9s Alou, 3B Bobby Bonilla, and trade-deadline additions [[Darren Daulton]] and [[Jim Eisenreich]] added experience and clutch hits. Talented young stars [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]] (2B) and [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]] (SS) comprised one of the best double play combos in the League. Castillo did not perform to expectations offensively, and was replaced by [[Craig Counsell]] before the playoffs began. The Marlins swept the [[1997 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] 3\u20130 in the [[1997 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]], and then went on to beat the [[1997 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] 4\u20132 in the [[1997 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], overcoming the loss of Alex Fernandez to a torn rotator cuff, and Kevin Brown to a virus. Brown's place was taken in Game 5 by rookie pitcher [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]], who had earned a spot in the rotation in the second half of the season, but was not in the rotation during the postseason. Hernandez struck out 15 Braves and outdueled multiple Cy Young Award winner [[Greg Maddux]] to a 2\u20131 victory and a 3\u20132 series lead. Brown returned to the mound for Game 6, pitching a complete game victory to secure the Marlins their first-ever National League pennant. The underdog Marlins went on to face the [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[1997 World Series]], and won in seven games. In Game 7, Craig Counsell's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth tied the game at 2, then, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 11th, \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda's soft liner glanced off the glove of Cleveland pitcher [[Charles Nagy]] and into center field to score Counsell and give the Marlins the win.\n\n==== The \"Fire Sale\" offseason====\nFollowing the World Series victory, Huizenga dismantled the team, claiming financial losses despite winning the World Series. He traded most of the club's best players in one of the biggest [[fire sale (sports)|fire sales]] in sports history. The first deal came days after the World Series, when outfielder Mois\u00e9s Alou was traded to the [[Houston Astros]] for pitchers Oscar Hernandez and [[Manuel Barrios]]. The Marlins then traded Kevin Brown to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Derrek Lee]] and 2 minor leaguers. Finally, in May 1998, they dealt Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich, and [[Manuel Barrios]] to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for [[Mike Piazza]] and [[Todd Zeile]], both of whom would be gone via trades by midseason. On the flip side, these trades brought promising youngsters [[Derrek Lee]] and [[A. J. Burnett]].\n\nThe Marlins did manage to win a second World Series just six years later in 2003.  Only one player played on both championship teams: i.e., [[Jeff Conine]], who ironically was one of the players included in the \"fire sale.\"  Conine was traded after the 1997 season to the [[Kansas City Royals]] who in turn traded him to the [[Baltimore Orioles]].  The Marlins picked up Conine in a late season trade during the 2003 pennant race.\n\n=== 1998\u20132002: Last place finishes, new ownership and front office ===\nThe Marlins slumped to 54\u2013108 in {{mlby|1998}}, the worst record in the major leagues that year, and the most losses in franchise history. They are the only team to lose 100 games a year after winning the World Series. Leyland resigned as manager in October 1998, and was replaced by John Boles. Huizenga soon sold the club to [[John W. Henry|John Henry]], a commodities trader from [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], during the off-season. The Marlins had the second overall pick in the [[1999 Major League Baseball draft|1999 draft]] and drafted [[Josh Beckett]], a high school pitcher from [[Greater Houston|the Houston area]].\n\nIn [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]], the Marlins were the first MLB team to host a game in which [[Instant replay in baseball|instant replay]] was used.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1999/05/31/cardinals_marlins/ | work=CNN | title=Marlins object to umps watching TV | date=June 1, 1999 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> While playing the [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]], [[Cliff Floyd]] hit a ball to the top of the left field scoreboard.

The Marlins also drafted P [[Johan Santana]] from Houston in the [[Rule 5 draft]] but traded him to Minnesota in a prearranged deal for P Jared Camp.\n\nA month prior to the regular season, the Marlins hired [[David Dombrowski]] as the third President in club history, making him both President and [[General manager (baseball)|General Manager]]. After posting the worst record in baseball for the 1999 season, the Marlins had the first overall pick in the [[2000 Major League Baseball draft|2000 first-year player draft]] and selected first baseman [[Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], an 18-year-old native of [[Bonita, California]]. The [[Eastlake High School (Chula Vista, California)|Eastlake High School]] product agreed to terms with the Marlins that same day. The Marlins went on that season to finish 79\u201382 and third in the NL East. This was thanks to the emergence of OF [[Preston Wilson]] who had 31 home runs and 121 RBIs. Derrek Lee and Luis Castillo broke out this year as well, as Castillo posted a .334 batting average and Lee had 28 homers in his first full season. [[Antonio Alfonseca]] posted a then-club record 45 saves.\n\nThe club slowly worked its way back to respectability with a third-place finish in 2000, driven by young stars such as [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Brad Penny]], [[Preston Wilson]], Luis Castillo, and [[Mike Lowell]]. Burnett pitched the Marlins' third no-hitter on May 12, {{mlby|2001}}, against the Padres, despite walking nine batters and throwing only half of his pitches for strikes. Three weeks after the no-no, Manager John Boles was fired and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] was named interim manager for the rest of the season. The club finished 76\u201386 and in fourth place, thanks to Brad Penny's and A. J. Burnett's emergence.\n\nThe offseason following the 2001 regular season included an overhaul of the ownership and front office. Tony P\u00e9rez resigned and returned to his previous role as the front-office Baseball Operations assistant. About a month later, David Dombrowski resigned as President and General Manager of the Florida Marlins and accepted the position as President of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Entering the new year, Henry sold the Marlins to [[Montreal Expos]] owner [[Jeffrey Loria]], clearing the way for Henry to buy the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Loria brought the entire Expos management and coaching staff to the Marlins. David Samson became team president, [[Larry Beinfest]] became General Manager and [[Jeff Torborg]] became manager.\n\nPrior to the 2002 season, the Marlins traded RHP [[Matt Clement]] and RHP [[Antonio Alfonseca]] to the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] for RHP [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]], LHP [[Dontrelle Willis]], RHP Jose Cueto and C Ryan Jorgensen. The Marlins had their ups as Luis Castillo had a team record 35-game hitting streak and [[Kevin Millar]] had a 25-game hit streak. Around the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break they made their second big trade, sending OF Cliff Floyd to the Expos for RHP [[Carl Pavano]], RHP Justin Wayne, INF [[Mike Mordecai]], LHP Graeme Lloyd, RHP Don Levinski and INF Wilton Guerrero. The same day, the Fish dealt RHP [[Ryan Dempster]] to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for OF [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and LHP Ryan Snare. The Marlins finished 79\u201383, the second-best season in team history up to that time, but their fifth straight losing season since winning the World Series.\n\nThe Marlins also turned their first ever [[triple play]] in franchise history on July 28, 2002.\n\n=== 2003\u20132005: The 1st Jack McKeon era and Second World Championship===\n[[File:Jack_McKeon_and_George_W._Bush.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Members of the 2003 Florida Marlins championship team with [[George W.

The Marlins did acquire P [[Mike Hampton]] but dealt him and his hefty contract to the Braves for P [[Tim Spooneybarger]].\n\nThe Marlins struggled in the opening stages of the season, going 16\u201322. During that span, Florida lost its top three pitchers: [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Josh Beckett]], and [[Mark Redman]]. On May 11, Florida replaced manager Jeff Torborg with 72-year-old [[Jack McKeon]]. On May 22, the Marlins hit bottom with a major league worst record of 19\u201329, having lost 6 straight games. However, help was on the way.\n\nOn May 9, the Marlins called up high-kicking southpaw [[Dontrelle Willis]] from the Double-A [[Carolina Mudcats (1991\u20132011)|Carolina Mudcats]] and helped carry the injury-plagued Marlins with an 11\u20132 record in his first 17 starts. [[Miguel Cabrera]] (also from the Mudcats) filled in well, hitting a walk off home run in his first major league game, against the [[2003 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] at [[Pro Player Stadium]]. Both Willis and Cabrera would later prove to be essential parts of the Marlin's playoff success. [[Jeff Conine]] \u2013 an original Marlin and member of the 1997 World Series team \u2013 returned from [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]], and closer [[Ugueth Urbina]] arrived from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. These acquisitions helped to keep the team in contention, and although they finished ten games behind the Braves, the Marlins captured the NL wild card.\n\nThe Marlins won the [[2003 National League Division Series|Division Series]] against the favored [[2003 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] three games to one. The series ended with a dramatic collision between Marlins catcher Rodr\u00edguez and Giants first baseman [[J. T. Snow]], making it the first postseason series ever to end with the potential tying run being thrown out at the plate. It was the second time that the Marlins defeated the Giants in the Division Series, having done so in 1997.\n\nOn October 15, the Marlins defeated the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] four games to three in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|Championship Series]], coming back from a three games to one deficit. A Beckett complete-game [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] in Game 5 kept the Marlins alive. Game 6 saw the Marlins play a role in one of baseball's most infamous moments: \"[[2003 National League Championship Series|The Inning]]\" . With 1 one out in the 8th inning and the Cubs 3 runs ahead, Marlins 2nd baseman Luis Castillo hit a pop foul a row into the stands along the third base line. Cubs fan [[Steve Bartman]] reached for the ball, preventing Cubs LF Mois\u00e9s Alou from making the out and setting off an 8-run Marlins rally. The incident with [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]] and a come-from-behind win in [[Wrigley Field]] in Game 7 helped the Marlins capture their second NL pennant, keeping the \"[[Curse of the Billy Goat]]\" alive and well.\n\nIn the [[2003 World Series]], the Marlins defeated the heavily favored [[2003 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in six games, winning the sixth game in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Shortstop [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (shortstop, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] helped the Marlins in Game 4 of the series with a walk off home run in extra innings. Josh Beckett was named the Most Valuable Player for the series after twirling a five-hit complete-game shutout in Game 6. Skipper Jack McKeon became the oldest manager ever to win a World Series title. The Marlins became the first opposing team to win a Series championship on the field at Yankee Stadium since [[1981 World Series|1981]], when the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] did it. The Marlins are also the last team to win a World Series at the original Yankee Stadium; the Yankees themselves would not participate in another World Series until [[2009 World Series|2009]], when they defeated the then-defending champion [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] at [[Yankee Stadium|the new Yankee Stadium]]. The Marlins won the series despite scoring fewer runs (17) than the Yankees (21).\n\n==== 2004: Winning season, but no repeat ====\n{{Main|2004 Florida Marlins season}}\nThe offseason after their second World Series title, the Marlins made a questionable cost-cutting move as [[Derrek Lee]] was traded to [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[Hee-seop Choi]] and pitcher Mike Nannini. The Marlins also lost key parts of their second championship team, [[Ugueth Urbina]] and [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]] left via free agency (signed by the [[Detroit Tigers]]). Marlins third base coach [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] also departed to be manager of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. The Marlins did get good news though as [[Dontrelle Willis]] was named [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|NL Rookie of the Year]] and Jack McKeon named [[Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]].  They also signed Mike Lowell to a new four-year contract.\n\nAfter winning the 2003 World Series, the Marlins entered 2004 with high hopes and a retooled roster. Retaining a core of stars from their title team and hoping that newly acquired 1B [[Hee-seop Choi]] would emerge, the Marlins fell short of reaching the postseason, but they posted the third winning season in franchise history, boasting an 83-79 record. During the season, the Marlins were to make one of the biggest trades in club history as Los Angeles got P [[Brad Penny]], 1B Choi and Double-A left-hander [[Bill Murphy (baseball)|Bill Murphy]] in exchange for P [[Guillermo Mota]], C [[Paul Lo Duca]] and OF [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]]. Pitchers [[Carl Pavano]] and [[Armando Ben\u00edtez]] turned in record-setting performances. Pavano went 18-8 with a 3.30 ERA, and his 18 wins established a season high by a Marlin. Benitez became the club's season saves leader with 47 (in 51 saves attempts). Pavano, Benitez, Mike Lowell and [[Miguel Cabrera]] each enjoyed All-Star seasons, with Cabrera belting 33 homers (second-most ever in a season by a Marlin) while driving in 112 runs.\n\n==== 2005 ====\n{{Main|2005 Florida Marlins season}}\n\n=====September collapse =====\nWhile losing All-Stars [[Carl Pavano]] and [[Armando Ben\u00edtez]] in the off-season, the Marlins signed [[pitcher|P]] Al Leiter and [[first baseman|1B]] [[Carlos Delgado]]. Delgado's contract was the biggest in franchise history at $52 million over 4 years, with an option for a fifth year. Meanwhile, play-by-play TV broadcaster [[Len Kasper]] was also lost to the Chicago Cubs and replaced by [[Rich Waltz]] (who had previously been with the [[Seattle Mariners]]), and radio announcer [[Jon Sciambi|John \"Boog\" Sciambi]] was replaced by [[Roxy Bernstein]].\n\nWith the addition of Delgado, many sportswriters expected the Marlins to finish the {{Baseball Year|2005}} [[2005 Major League Baseball season|season]] in either first or second place in the NL East. However, at the All-Star break they were 44\u201342, and the NL East was unusually competitive, as all five of its teams had a winning record at the break. While Cabrera, Willis, and several others posted very good first-half numbers, Lowell was one of the least productive regular major-league starters, and Leiter went 3\u20137 with an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 6.64 before being traded to the New York Yankees on July 15 for a player to be named later. Additionally, [[Guillermo Mota]], who was acquired by Florida in 2004 along with [[Paul Lo Duca]] and [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and was expected to be their closer, was inconsistent, and the Marlins gave the closer job to veteran [[Todd Jones]], whom they signed in the offseason. However, the Marlins did send four players to the All-Star Game (Willis, Lo Duca, Castillo, and Cabrera), tying a team record.\n\nThe club was expected to be quite active at the trading deadline (July 31), as Burnett was slated to be a free agent after the season and had already declared his desire to test the market like Pavano did. Burnett was mentioned in possible trades with the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, [[New York Yankees]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and Texas Rangers, with many rumors also including Lowell or Encarnacion. The Marlins did not make a huge move at the deadline, instead trading minor-leaguer [[Yorman Bazardo]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for left-handed pitcher [[Ron Villone]].\n\nThe Marlins did have some pleasant surprises during the season. [[Dontrelle Willis]] became the 13th member of the [[Black Aces]] when he defeated the [[2005 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]] to earn his 20th win. He finished the season 22-10 with a 2.63 ERA, and he was considered a favorite to win the [[Cy Young Award]] for much of the season. Also, Jones, a journeyman who had been signed as a setup man, had one of the best years of his career as a closer; he earned 40 [[save (baseball)|saves]] and had a 2.13 ERA. In addition, late-season call up [[Jeremy Hermida]], a highly regarded prospect who has been compared to the Atlanta Braves' [[Jeff Francoeur]], hit a pinch-hit grand slam in his first major-league at-bat and a game-tying two-run homer in the last game of the season.\n\nThe Marlins led the NL wild-card race as late as September 13, then lost 12 of their next 14 games. The Marlins closed the season by sweeping the Braves, and their final record for the season stood at 83\u201379. After the season, lingering stadium issues forced the Marlins to ponder big moves with their roster and also ponder possible relocation to another city.\n\n===== The \"Market Correction\" offseason =====\nThe 2005 offseason would prove to be one of busiest for the Marlins in years. It began with Jack McKeon announcing his retirement on October 2 after the Marlins' last game of the season. Former [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] manager [[Lou Piniella]], Braves third base coach [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] (who previously managed in the Marlins' farm system), [[New York Yankees]] bench coach [[Joe Girardi]], and even Yankees manager [[Joe Torre]] who most thought could have been let go after a short stint postseason, were named as possible replacements for McKeon.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051002&content_id=1235159&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> On October 19, Girardi was hired as the new manager.

Pitching coach [[Mark Wiley (baseball)|Mark Wiley]] and bullpen coach [[Luis Dorante]] came under fire during the season due to the late-season struggles of Burnett and the season-long struggles of the Marlins' bullpen. Similarly, hitting coach [[Bill Robinson (outfielder)|Bill Robinson]] was often blamed for the Marlins' offensive woes throughout the season, and in particular for his failure to get Pierre and Lowell out of season-long slumps. Girardi hired [[Jim Presley]] as a replacement for Robinson, and also hired [[Rick Kranitz]] as the new pitching coach and [[Bobby Meacham]] as the new third-base coach.\n\nOn October 3, the first day after the end of the regular season, the Marlins made their first offseason moves, releasing relief pitchers [[John Riedling]] and [[Tim Spooneybarger]]. Riedling had a 4\u20131 record and a 7.14 ERA during the season; Spooneybarger, who had not played since 2003 due to rehabilitation from [[Tommy John surgery]], had to have the surgery a second time during the season and missed the {{mlby|2006|disp=seas}} as well. [[Screwball]] specialist [[Jim Mecir]] retired following the Marlins' last game of the season.\n\nCloser [[Todd Jones]], pitchers [[A. J. Burnett]], [[Brian Moehler]], [[Ismael Vald\u00e9z]], [[Paul Quantrill]], first baseman [[Jeff Conine]], infielder [[Lenny Harris]], outfielder [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]], and shortstop [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (shortstop, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] were among the Marlins' players whose contracts expired following the 2005 season. Burnett signed a five-year deal with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] worth $55 million and Jones signed for two years with the [[Detroit Tigers]], while Moehler elected to remain with the Marlins. The team declined to offer arbitration to Conine, Vald\u00e9z, Quantrill, Encarnaci\u00f3n, [[Damion Easley]], and [[Mike Mordecai]], effectively ending their tenures with the club.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051207&content_id=1278816&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Soon after announcing a plan to relocate (see below), the Marlins started to shed payroll by dealing their highest-paid players for minor league prospects, in a series of moves reminiscent of the \"fire sale\" in the 1997 offseason.

The trade left Dontrelle Willis as the only remaining member of the team's 2005 Opening Day rotation. The Marlins filled most of the remaining rotation spots with young pitchers such as [[Jason Vargas]], [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], and [[Scott Olsen]], all of whom they had recalled from their [[Carolina Mudcats (1991\u20132011)|Class AA affiliate]] during the 2005 season.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051125&content_id=1272277&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn November 23, the Mets and the Marlins agreed on a deal to move Carlos Delgado to the Mets for first baseman [[Mike Jacobs (first baseman)|Mike Jacobs]] and pitching prospect [[Yusmeiro Petit]]. Also, the Marlins would have to pay $7 million of Delgado's remaining contract. When the deal was made official the next day, the Marlins also received minor-league infielder Grant Psomas. According to the ''[[Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]'', the Marlins passed up the Mets' offer to give them center fielder [[Lastings Milledge]], who was at the time ranked the Mets' top prospect according to ''[[Baseball America]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/931114551.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+24%2C+2005&author=Juan+C.+Rodriguez+Staff+Writer&pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&edition=&startpage=1.C&desc=DELGADO+JOINS+EXODUS+METS+GET+SLUGGER+FOR+TWO+PROSPECTS |title=Delgado Joins Exodus Mets Get Slugger For Two Prospects |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2005-11-24 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref> Combined, the two trades allowed the Marlins to reduce their 2006 payroll by $27 million.\n\nHowever, the Marlins were not yet done reducing payroll. [[Paul Lo Duca]] was traded to the Mets for two players to be named later, with the Marlins sending pitcher [[Gabriel Hernandez (baseball)|Gabriel Hernandez]] and outfielder [[Dante Brinkley]] to New York to complete the deal. Longtime second baseman Luis Castillo was traded to the Twins for pitchers [[Travis Bowyer]] and [[Scott Tyler (baseball)|Scott Tyler]], and [[Juan Pierre]] to the Cubs for pitchers [[Sergio Mitre]], [[Ricky Nolasco]], and [[Renyel Pinto]]. Of the seven players that the Marlins acquired in these three deals, only Mitre and Bowyer had any major-league experience when they came to the Marlins. To replace Castillo, the Marlins signed veteran [[Pokey Reese]], but Reese was released during spring training after going [[AWOL]], and was replaced by [[Dan Uggla]], who had been selected from the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the [[Rule 5 draft]]. Uggla played in the Arizona organization at the Class AA level in 2005.\n\n=== 2006\u20132011: Smaller payrolls, managerial changes, and new stars emerge ===\n\n==== 2006: Rebuilding ====\n{{Main|2006 Florida Marlins season}}\n[[File:IMG 1220 2006FloridaMarlins.jpg|right|thumb|300px|2006 Rebuilt Marlins taking the field in front of a sparse crowd.

Instead, the youthful squad greatly exceeded expectations, often in historical fashion. After getting off to an 11-31 start, the Marlins found themselves at 73-72 on September 12, making them the first team in the modern baseball era to improve to better than .500 after being as much as 20 games under .500. Also, for the first time in MLB history, four rookies topped double digits in wins: Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen, Ricky Nolasco and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez.\n\nOn September 6, 2006, Sanchez threw the fourth no-hitter in franchise history, beating Arizona, 2-0, at Dolphin Stadium. Miguel Cabrera finished second in the N.L. in batting average, and set a franchise season mark with his .339 average. [[Dan Uggla]] became the first Rule 5 pick to be selected to the All-Star Game in the season in which he was drafted and won Sporting News Rookie of the Year for the National League and won the Players' Choice award as the league's most outstanding rookie. [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] won the N.L. Rookie of the Year Award, and [[Joe Girardi]] was voted N.L. Manager of the Year. Dan Uggla finished third in the voting and starting pitcher [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], fourth; starting pitchers [[Scott Olsen]] and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and left fielder [[Josh Willingham]] received one third-place vote each.\n\nAdditionally, the Marlins had four of their rookie starting pitchers (An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], [[Scott Olsen]], and [[Ricky Nolasco]]) win at least ten games, becoming the first team in major-league history to do so. The 2006 Marlins also had five ten-game winners for the first time in franchise history (including Dontrelle Willis).\n\nShortly after the 2006 season ended and following months of speculation, Marlins manager [[Joe Girardi]] was fired on October 3, 2006 not long after winning the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] award. This was due to a game against the [[2006 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] earlier in the year in which Girardi did not challenge a call that pitcher [[Taylor Tankersley]] thought was a strike and this prompted owner Jeffrey Loria, who was in the stands and a few feet away from the dugout, to call out Girardi who refused to listen to him. This wasn't the only thing that triggered the feud; earlier in the year Girardi reportedly wanted 1B Mike Jacobs to start off the year in triple A, Willingham to start at catcher, Miguel Cabrera to start at first base.<ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061115&content_id=1740979&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Within hours, Atlanta Braves third base coach [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named his replacement and was signed to a three-year contract.\n\n==== 2007: Injuries deplete the Fish ====\n{{Main|2007 Florida Marlins season}}\nAfter a 2006 season which saw them defy expectations time and again, the Marlins entered 2007 hanging on to the belief that they could compete with anyone. It didn't turn out that way. Injuries ravaged the starting rotation and the Marlins struggled all season, ultimately finishing in last place in the National League East for the first time since 1999. Josh Johnson underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez had right shoulder surgery. [[Ricky Nolasco]] dealt with a sore elbow all season. Suddenly, the strength of the team\u2014the starting rotation\u2014was minus three key players. Despite a disappointing finish, there certainly were a number of highs\u2014Kevin Gregg emerged as a dominant closer, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] developed into a legitimate superstar and [[Miguel Cabrera]] proved why he already was one\u2014but none of them could ultimately overcome the odds heavily stacked against the Marlins. On the downside, southpaws [[Dontrelle Willis]] and [[Scott Olsen]] had disappointing campaigns. What was encouraging was an otherwise disappointing season ended on a high note. The team won five of six to end the season (sweeping the Cubs and taking two of three with the Mets at Shea Stadium). Still, after the season, the franchise went in a different direction. The year was capped by the trading of their two biggest stars, slugger [[Miguel Cabrera]] and pitcher [[Dontrelle Willis]]. Talks with both the [[Los Angeles Angels]] and [[San Francisco Giants]] fell apart. On December 5, 2007, the Marlins agreed to the terms of a trade with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The trade would surprisingly send not only Cabrera, but also Willis, to the Tigers. In return, the Marlins did not receive four players, but six. The Marlins received center fielder [[Cameron Maybin]], catcher [[Mike Rabelo]], and pitchers [[Andrew Miller (baseball)|Andrew Miller]], [[Eulogio De La Cruz]], [[Burke Badenhop]], and [[Dallas Trahern]].\n\nThe Marlins did have some bright spots on offense as they set club records for runs scored (790), hits (1,504), doubles (340), home runs (201), RBIs (749) and slugging percentage (.448). As the Marlins wrapped up the season they announced that pitching coach Rick Kranitz would not be back with the club and extended Larry Beinfest and [[Michael Hill (baseball)|Michael Hill]] to long term deals that run through 2015 along with promotions to President of Baseball Operations and Vice President/General Manager, respectively.,<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/591/story/249352.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3041984 |title=Marlins give extensions to Beinfest, other front office executives \u2013 MLB \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==== 2008: Back to .500 baseball ====\n{{Main|2008 Florida Marlins season}}\nThe Marlins began 2008 on a positive note. Analysts expected a lackluster performance on the field, citing the low payroll and loss of [[Dontrelle Willis]] and [[Miguel Cabrera]] during the offseason. However, the Marlins got off to one of the best starts in team history. At one point the Marlins were 30\u201320, the first time since September 14, 2005 the team had been 10 games over .500. They jumped atop of the [[National League East]] in April and May, the first time since 2002 that they held the lead that late in the season. The good start was attributed to powerful offensive production from their core of Mike Jacobs, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]], [[Dan Uggla]], [[Josh Willingham]], and [[Jorge Cant\u00fa]] and quality pitching by [[southpaw]] [[Scott Olsen]] and right-hander [[Ricky Nolasco]]. The Marlins' hot start made them a rare buyer at the July trade deadline, where they were involved in talks on a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and Boston Red Sox which could have brought [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] to South Florida. The Marlins backed out at the last second when trade talks turned to their coveted power-hitting prospect, [[Giancarlo Stanton]]. Instead, Manny Ram\u00edrez ended up with the Dodgers and the Marlins wound up trading for [[Arthur Rhodes]].\n\n[[File:Hanley Ramirez.jpg|thumb|left|Ram\u00edrez (left) leading off first against the [[2008 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in 2008.]]The team also received encouraging news when injured pitcher [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]] made a fast recovery from Tommy John surgery and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez came back from a torn labrum in the shoulder, both leaping into the rotation right away along with newly called up prized prospect [[Chris Volstad]]. In addition, the Marlins sent two players, Hanley Ram\u00edrez, who started the game at shortstop, and reserve [[Dan Uggla]] to the last [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Marlins signed [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] to a 6-year, $70 million deal, making him the richest Marlin in history.\n\nThe team struggled in the month of August, when they went 11\u201316 due to lack of the offense they had in the early part of the season. In September, the Marlins rallied with a nine-game winning streak, tying the franchise record, thanks in part to prized prospect, Cameron Maybin. However they lost four straight afterwards and were eliminated from playoff contention, although but they did manage to eliminate the [[2008 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] for the second consecutive season on the final day, winning the final game at [[Shea Stadium]], 4-2.\n\nThe team finished with a franchise record for most home runs in a season at 208. Mike Jacobs, Dan Uggla, Hanley Ram\u00edrez and Jorge Cant\u00fa made MLB history by becoming the first foursome of infielders to hit at least 25 homers in a season. Just a day after the [[2008 World Series|World Series]] concluded, the Marlins began wheeling and dealing. They traded first baseman Mike Jacobs to the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]] for reliever [[Leo N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], who the Marlins hoped could become a setup-man in late innings. A few weeks later, the Marlins traded power hitting outfielder [[Josh Willingham]] and southpaw [[Scott Olsen]] to the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]] for utility player [[Emilio Bonifacio]] and two minor leaguers. Soon after the Marlins traded closer Kevin Gregg to the Cubs for relief prospect Jos\u00e9 Ceda.\n\n==== 2009: Falling short ====\n{{Main|2009 Florida Marlins season}}\nA few weeks before the regular season, the Florida Marlins' 15-year quest for a permanent home became a reality by agreeing to bankroll a big share of a $634 million stadium complex to rise on the grounds of the old [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] site. The Marlins hoped to open at the new stadium on Opening Day 2012 with a new name of '''Miami Marlins'''.\n\nThe Marlins kicked off the new season with the youngest team in baseball and with the lowest payroll for the fourth consecutive season. New leadoff man [[Emilio Bonifacio]] stole the show on Opening Day. He hit the first [[Opening Day]] [[inside-the-park home run]] since [[Carl Yastrzemski]] did it for the Boston Red Sox in [[1968 Major League Baseball season|1968]] and had three stolen bases to go along with four hits. Hanley Ram\u00edrez hit his first career [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] as the Marlins went on to score 12 runs, the most ever in franchise history on Opening Day.\n\nThe Marlins started the 2009 season hot by sweeping the [[2009 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]], only the second time they started the season with sweep since the 1997 Marlins team. The Marlins won their first four games for the first time in franchise history and started 11\u20131, which included 2 out of 3 wins from the [[2009 New York Mets season|Mets]], the first Marlins franchise sweep at [[Turner Field]], and three comeback late-inning wins against the Nationals in Washington, sweeping the teams' second series matchup. The 11\u20131 start was the best start in Marlins history. They then lost their next seven games starting with the 62-99 [[2009 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] making them the first team in NL history to win seven straight games then lose the next seven. But even though they were below .500 by as many as five games, they rebounded to 2 games above .500 as of July 1, 2009. Cody Ross, the leader of the rebound, hit 2 grand slams in 2 weeks. The Marlins also amazed many in the final series before the All-Star break against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Originally trailing by seven runs after five innings, the Marlins entered the eighth inning down 7-4, they sent 14 batters to the plate. In the benchmark frame, they collected eight hits, and had eight different players score for a total of ten runs in the inning. In all the Marlins collected 14 unanswered runs as they came back for their 21st come from behind victory of the season. After the first 100 games of the season they stood second in the NL East with a record of 52-48.\n\nComing out of the All-Star break, the Marlins were swept in three games by the Phillies, but they responded by sweeping the Padres in San Diego before taking two of three against the Dodgers. That 5-1 West Coast road trip\u2014from July 20\u201326\u2014reinforced to management that the team was in contention. Instead of being sellers at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline, first baseman Nick Johnson was acquired from the Nationals for pitching prospect Aaron Thompson, in the hopes that Johnson would bring his renowned plate discipline to the forefront of the Marlins' lineup. However other rumors began to surface that the team was exploring options in deals that would bring major players to Florida, including superstars [[Roy Halladay]] and [[Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], as well as closer [[Heath Bell]].\n\nIn August, the Marlins offense would take off. Rookie [[Chris Coghlan]] set a club record with ten consecutive multihit games. In addition, the Marlins would set a team record with 14 consecutive games with 10 or more hits, becoming the first team since the 1937 [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] to reach that milestone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090815&content_id=6438608&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Marlins reach 12 straight with 10-plus hits &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref><ref>[http://florida.marlins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090809&content_id=6329896&vkey=news_fla&fext=.jsp&c_id=fla] {{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> August would also see the Marlins sweeping the division leading [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after getting swept by the division cellar [[Washington Nationals]].

However, the status of [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] for the 2010 season was put in question when a report by [[ESPN]]'s [[Buster Olney]] said the Marlins had made contact with [[Bobby Valentine]]. The Marlins put those rumors to rest days later confirming that the all-time winningest manager in franchise history would remain at the helm. On the other hand, pitching coach [[Mark Wiley (baseball)|Mark Wiley]] and infield/first-base coach [[Andy Fox]] were not retained.\n\nSoon after the World Series, the Marlins began their off-season.

Marlins owner [[Jeffrey Loria]] expressed high hopes saying, \"I expect us to make the playoffs, we've got all the ammunition we need.\"\n\nHowever, those aspirations proved to be misplaced, as little went right in Miami. In mid-May, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] was suspended for a game by manager Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez for not hustling towards a fly ball which cost the team runs and a loss. Nearly two weeks later, Roy Halladay threw a perfect game against Florida, which was the first one thrown against the Marlins in franchise history.\n\nOn June 23, with the team sitting at 34-36 along with having a shaky bullpen and inconsistent situational hitting and bench, Loria decided to fire [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] along with bench coach [[Carlos Tosca]] and hitting coach [[Jim Presley]] on June 23. At the time of his dismissal, Gonz\u00e1lez's record for the season was 32-34. Edwin Rodriguez was promoted from Triple-A [[New Orleans Zephyrs|New Orleans]] as Florida's new manager. Sandwiched between those two announcements were talks with former Rangers and Mets manager [[Bobby Valentine]] but those talks broke down. Edwin Rodriguez's first game was a June 23 win against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\nOther disappointments came in the way of injuries to core players, Chris Coghlan, the 2009 NL Rookie of the Year, tore the meniscus in his left knee while jamming a shaving-cream pie in Wes Helms' face. Ricky Nolasco tore the meniscus in his right knee when he took off a shoe. When all was said and done, a club-record 57 players rotated through the clubhouse.\n\nAt the All-Star Break, [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]] participated in the [[State Farm]] [[Home Run Derby]] and became the first Marlin to reach the finals. Ramirez lost to [[David Ortiz]] but set a Marlins record for most home runs hit in the Derby with 26.\n\nAfter the All-Star Break, the Marlins went on a surge, getting off to an 11-5 start thanks in large part to [[Dan Uggla]], who also set a Marlins franchise record for total home runs at 144, passing Mike Lowell. In that same week (July 19-July 25), the Marlins had four walk-off base hits, two by Donnie Murphy and one each from [[Ronny Paulino]] and [[Wes Helms]]. It was that week which brought up the need to be buyers at the trade deadline. Considered in contention for the playoffs, the Marlins traded [[Rick VandenHurk]] to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for lefty [[Will Ohman]] to shore up a shaky bullpen.\n\nThe second half also saw the emergence of rookie outfielders [[Giancarlo Stanton|Michael Stanton]] and [[Logan Morrison]], who replaced the injured Chris Coghlan. Rookie first baseman Gaby S\u00e1nchez also put up good numbers, at the top of most lists in home runs, RBIs, and batting average, to contend for the NL Rookie of the Year award.\n\nThe Marlins 2010 season was considered a disappointment, as they finished under .500 for the first time since 2007.\n\n===== Off-season changes =====\nSoon after the World Series, the team began its offseason on trying to improve its defense and bullpen while filling a dire need at catcher. Out of the gate, the Florida Marlins became one of the most active teams on the market. After retaining [[Edwin Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)|Edwin Rodr\u00edguez]] and bringing back defensive guru Perry Hill, the team traded the disappointing results of the notorious [[Miguel Cabrera]]\u2013[[Dontrelle Willis]] trade.  Andrew Miller was the first to go when he was traded to the Boston Red Sox on November 12 in exchange for another lefty, [[Dustin Richardson]], a relief pitcher.  The next day, the team shipped out young center fielder Cameron Maybin to the [[San Diego Padres]] for relief pitchers [[Ryan Webb]] and [[Edward Mujica]] to help in the expected overhaul of the team's disappointing bullpen.\n\nAs soon as the season ended, the team began negotiations for a long-term deal that would keep All-Star second baseman [[Dan Uggla]] with the team.  After rejecting the team's offer of $48 million over four years because of his desire for a fifth year totaling $71 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/marlins/commentary-cut-rate-marlins-cut-loose-another-producer-1052871.html |title=Commentary: Cut-rate Florida Marlins cut loose Dan Uggla in favor |work=Palm Beach Post |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref> the team reached a stalemate with Uggla, meaning his days with the team were numbered.  Days later on November 16, in order to get some kind of return for Uggla, the team dealt him to their divisional rivals, the Atlanta Braves, for fellow All-Star and utility man [[Omar Infante]] and relief pitcher [[Michael Dunn (baseball)|Mike Dunn]].\n\nEarlier in that same day, the team came to terms on a three-year deal with All-Star catcher [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]], formerly of the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. With even more money left to spend, the team later signed free agent pitcher [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]] to a one-year, $7 million contract which had a no-trade clause. It signaled a change in the philosophy of the franchise who hadn't made such a free agent signing since 2005 when they had signed Carlos Delgado to a multi-year contract.\n\nThe team wasn't done yet, as they signed yet another of their current players to an extension.  [[Ricky Nolasco]] agreed to a three-year deal that would pay him $26.5 million through 2013, making him one of five players on the roster with a multi-year contract (the others being [[Hanley Ram\u00edrez]], [[Josh Johnson (baseball)|Josh Johnson]], [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]], and [[Randy Choate]]).\n\n===2011: Short-lived resurgence ===\n{{Main|2011 Florida Marlins season}}\nAfter the Marlins began the season with the best start in franchise history through 50 games (30\u201320), they had one of the worst runs in MLB history. Starting the month of June with a .053 winning percentage (1\u201318), manager [[Edwin Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)|Edwin Rodr\u00edguez]] resigned, and the Marlins hired former manager and special assistant to the GM [[Jack McKeon]]. The Marlins finished the month at a franchise worst 5\u201323, but began July at 10\u20134. The Marlins dropped from the second-best record in the [[National League]] to last place in the National League East. In the final 112 games of the season, the Marlins played 40\u201372, finishing with 72 wins and 90 losses, last in the National League East.\n\n=== 2012\u20132017: Move to Miami, continued struggles, tragedy ===\n[[File:Marlins First Pitch at Marlins Park, April 4, 2012.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The Miami Marlins in front of a sellout crowd at the inaugural Opening Night game at [[Marlins Park]] against the reigning World champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]]]]\n\nIn September 2011, the Marlins acquired manager [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]] in a trade with the Chicago White Sox.

The team finished 69\u201393, its worst record since 1999. This resulted in Guill\u00e9n being fired after one season. [[Mike Redmond]] succeeded him as the Marlins' manager.

The Marlins finished 62\u2013100, the second 100-loss season for the team, and the first since 1998. However, the season ended on a good note, as the Marlins, already out of contention, beat the Detroit Tigers as Henderson \u00c1lvarez threw the franchise's fifth no-hitter in a 1-0 season-ending victory at Marlins Park and [[Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez (pitcher)|Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez]] won the NL Rookie of the Year.\n\nPrior to the 2014 season, the Marlins acquired several hitters in an attempt to supplement their strong pitching and defense, including [[Garrett Jones]], [[Casey McGehee]], [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]] and [[Rafael Furcal]].

After the season's conclusion, Stanton was signed to the largest contract in MLB history: 13&nbsp;years and $325&nbsp;million. The Marlins then acquired [[Aaron Crow]] from the [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Dee Gordon]] and [[Dan Haren]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and [[Mat Latos]] from the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and then signed [[free agent]]s [[Michael Morse]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]], who became the first-ever Japanese-born Marlin in franchise history.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wine|first1=Steven|title=Stanton Signs Record $325M Deal at News Conference|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/stanton-signs-record-325m-deal-news-conference-27024292|website=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nWith the Marlins' talented roster, they entered the 2015 season with high expectations.
