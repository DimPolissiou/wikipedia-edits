Consequently, the national team did not play its first match as a new country until 23 December 1994, a 2\u20130 friendly defeat to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Porto Alegre]]. This was the first ever team composed of [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] players exclusively, while [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]], a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team's first ever manager. The next match was played only three days later, a 1\u20130 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nDue to the United Nations international sanctions, the team could not take part in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification]], nor the [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying]] process.\n\nOn 31 March 1995, the team recorded its first official win in history, a 1\u20130 friendly against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], simultaneously marking the team's first ever home match, played at [[Stadion Crvena Zvezda]] in [[Belgrade]], and the first ever goal scored, courtesy of [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Slightly more than one year later, the team recorded its first ever win in a [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifying tournament in its first match in such a tournament, a 3\u20131 win over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Shortly after, the team also recorded its biggest win in history, once again against the Faroe Islands, 8\u20131. Yugoslavia finished second in Group 6, just behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], meaning it had to go through the play-off system in order to qualify. Yugoslavia was paired up with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], and what was believed would be a tough matchup turned out to be an easy win for Yugoslavia, 7\u20131 in [[Budapest]] and 5\u20130 in Belgrade, for an aggregate score of 12\u20131. This was enough to secure Yugoslavia its first ever World Cup appearance as a new country.\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n| GK      = [[Ivica Kralj|'''Kralj''']]\n| RB      = [[Zoran Mirkovi\u0107|'''Mirkovi\u0107''']]| \n| RCB     = [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107|'''Komljenovi\u0107''']]\n| LCB     = [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107|'''Mihajlovi\u0107''']]\n| LB      = [[Goran \u0110orovi\u0107|'''\u0110orovi\u0107''']]\n| RWB      = [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107|'''Jokanovi\u0107''']]\n| DM      = [[Branko Brnovi\u0107|'''Brnovi\u0107''']]\n| LWB      = [[\u017deljko Petrovi\u0107|'''Petrovi\u0107''']]\n| RM     = [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107|'''Jugovi\u0107''']]\n| LM     = [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107|'''Stojkovi\u0107''']]\n| SS      = [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107|'''Mijatovi\u0107''']]\n| caption = Yugoslavia's starting XI under coach [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]] in [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Netherlands vs FR Yugoslavia|their 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in the final 16 of the 1998 World Cup]].</small><ref>[https://www.football-lineups.com/match/40245/] Football-Lineups: Netherlands vs Yugoslavia World Cup 1998</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup seeding|1998 World Cup seeding]] had Yugoslavia ranked in the 21st position, but the Yugoslav national team went to France as one of the shadow favourites for the World Cup. ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated Yugoslavia could easily be a semi-finalist in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|that year's World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F16FF3D5B0C758EDDAF0894D0494D81 | work=The New York Times | first=George | last=Vecsey | title=Sports of The Times; Scrapbooks Of History For the U.S | date=26 June 1998}}</ref> The justification for such an estimation was partially found in the names of the Yugoslav players, members of great European teams and proven footballers. The draw put the team in Group F alongside [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. Yugoslavia won its first match 1\u20130 against Iran thanks to a goal from defender [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]]. The next match was a draw for Yugoslavia; after leading Germany 2\u20130, last game's hero, Mihajlovi\u0107, scored an unlucky own goal following a German free-kick, and [[Oliver Bierhoff]] equalised at 2\u20132 with only about ten minutes to the match. Nonetheless, Yugoslavia responded in the next match against the United States and won 1\u20130 due to an early goal in [[Nantes]]. Yugoslavia finished second in Group F, for despite finishing level on points with Germany, Germany finished first via a superior goal difference.\n\nFinishing second, Yugoslavia was drawn with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#round of 16|round of 16]]. Yugoslavia entered in the match with a sole attacker, but its defensive tactics proved unsuccessful as [[Dennis Bergkamp]] put the Netherlands in front in the 38th minute. Immediately following the start of the second half, Yugoslavia pressured the Dutch, who inevitably conceded a header from [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107]]. However, the turning point of this match was a penalty awarded to Yugoslavia after [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] was fouled in the penalty area. [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]]'s shot dazzled [[Edwin van der Sar]], but not the crossbar, and the scoreline remained level at 1\u20131. In the late seconds of the match, [[Edgar Davids]] took a shot from 20 metres out which beat goalkeeper [[Ivica Kralj]], to the disbelief of the Yugoslav players and fans. This marked the end of Yugoslavia's run in the World Cup.\n\n====Euro 2000====\n{{see also|UEFA Euro 2000 Group C|UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage}}\nThe draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifiers]] saw many eyebrows raised as first-seeded Yugoslavia was drawn in a group alongside [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], marking the first matches between the two teams after the [[Yugoslav Wars|breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The other teams in the group were the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. When the qualifiers began, the coach was [[Milan \u017divadinovi\u0107]], but in July 1999 he resigned and was replaced by [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]].\n\nThe team started with a 1\u20130 win over Ireland in Belgrade, before beating Malta 3\u20130 in [[Ta' Qali]]. The home fixture against the Maltese followed, but was moved to [[Thessaloniki]], Greece, due to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. The team nonetheless won 4\u20131. The first, highly anticipated match against Croatia took place in Belgrade shortly after the bombing ended, and was interrupted due to a power outage at the beginning of the second half, resuming after 43 minutes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs/news/1999-08/19/13984.html|title=Serbian Government >> News >> Sports >> FOOTBALL: YUGOSLAVIA - Croatia 0-0|website=www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs}}</ref> and eventually finishing 0\u20130. A 2\u20131 defeat against Ireland in [[Dublin]] was followed by victories home and away against Macedonia (3\u20131 and 4\u20132 respectively), meaning Yugoslavia needed to win its final qualifier against Croatia in [[Zagreb]], or to draw with Ireland failing to beat Macedonia in [[Skopje]], in order to automatically qualify for Euro 2000. As it happened, Ireland conceded an injury-time equalizer, meaning Yugoslavia's 2\u20132 draw with the Croatians was sufficient for automatic qualification.\n\nThe draw for the Euro 2000 final stages placed Yugoslavia in Group C alongside [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and another former Yugoslav republic, [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. The Slovenians took a surprise 3\u20130 lead in the first match at the [[Stade du Pays de Charleroi]], but three goals in six second-half minutes enabled Yugoslavia to secure a 3\u20133 draw. The team then beat Norway 1\u20130 in [[Li\u00e8ge]] thanks to an early Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 backheel strike. The final group match, against Spain in [[Bruges]], saw the Yugoslavs take the lead three times, before a [[Gaizka Mendieta]] penalty and an [[Alfonso P\u00e9rez|Alfonso]] strike in injury-time secured a dramatic 4\u20133 win for the Spaniards and top spot in the group. Yugoslavia nonetheless finished second, level on points with Norway but ranked ahead due to their head-to-head victory in Li\u00e8ge. In each of the three matches, Yugoslavia had one player sent off: [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]] and [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] respectively.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]], Yugoslavia was once again paired with the Netherlands. However, unlike the last encounter, the co-hosts made easy work of Yugoslavia, winning 6\u20131 in [[Rotterdam]], with [[Patrick Kluivert]] scoring a [[hat-trick]].\n\nOne of the few bright spots of Yugoslav team in the whole tournament was Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who finished as the joint top scorer of the tournament, alongside Patrick Kluivert. Both players scored five goals, although Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played one less match.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | title=Leading goalscorers | work=UEFA.com | publisher=Union of European Football Associations | date=2 July 2000 | accessdate=12 July 2012 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20000711003231/www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | archivedate=11 July 2000 }}</ref>\n\n====Failure to qualify for 2002 World Cup====\nThe [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification|2002 World Cup qualifiers]] marked the first time Yugoslavia failed to qualify for a major tournament ever since its return to \"big stage\" football after the UN sanctions. The problems began with the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|major political turmoil in the country]] as well in the Yugoslav FA, which prompted new head coach [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] to resign after only one match, a 2\u20130 away victory against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].\n\n[[Milovan \u0110ori\u0107]] took over the team, but under his leadership, the team managed only two draws, 1\u20131 at home against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and 1\u20131 away against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. In both matches, the opponents equalized in late stages of the match). Yugoslavia then lost 0\u20131 at home to [[Russia national football team|Russia]], marking the nation's first home defeat in official matches. After \u0110ori\u0107's resignation, a three-man commission consisting of [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]] and [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]] took over the coaching duties, until Savi\u0107evi\u0107 ultimately took over on his own. The team managed to bounce back with a draw in Russia and a win in Switzerland, but failed to defeat Slovenia in the penultimate game, thus finishing their qualifying group in third position.\n\n===Ilija Petkovi\u0107 era (2003\u20132006)===\n{{see also|2006 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n[[File:Elfenbeink\u00fcste - Serbien und Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Serbia and Montenegro playing against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] at the [[Allianz Arena]] during the 2006 FIFA World Cup]]\nAfter Savi\u0107evi\u0107's disastrous spell as head coach, the country went under a [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro|political transformation]], and [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] became the newly named Serbia and Montenegro's new coach. Initially, the team under his lead experienced dragging failure in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifiers]] while competing for the first time as Serbia and Montenegro. Despite drawing both matches against group favourites and eventual group winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and winning both matches against group runners-up [[Wales national football team|Wales]], Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to an embarrassing 2\u20132 home draw and 2\u20131 away loss to [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]].\n\nHowever, Serbia and Montenegro qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. Serbia and Montenegro began their 2006 World Cup campaign by finishing first with an undefeated record in their [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] group ahead of favourites Spain. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in its ten matches, the best defensive record out all 51 teams participating in qualification. For the 2006 qualifiers, Serbia and Montenegro was drawn in a group with Spain, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. Led once again by Ilija Petkovi\u0107, Serbia and Montenegro played some impressive defensive football: the \"Famous Four\" defence consisting of [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]], [[Mladen Krstaji\u0107]], [[Goran Gavran\u010di\u0107]] and [[Ivica Dragutinovi\u0107]], with [[Dragoslav Jevri\u0107]] as goalkeeper allowed only one goal in ten matches, finishing first in their group with a 6\u20134\u20130 record.\n\nOn 3 June 2006, following a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]], Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia. As the World Cup was about to start, it was decided that the Serbia and Montenegro team that had qualified for the tournament would compete, with the split into separate teams representing the new countries of Montenegro and Serbia to take place once the team was eliminated from the tournament. Thus, the team played in the tournament representing a state that no longer existed.<ref name=withoutcountry/> Only one Montenegrin-born player, goalkeeper [[Dragoslav Jevri\u0107]], was in the squad.<ref name=withoutcountry>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/wire/_/section/soccer/id/2485949|title=Serbia-Montenegro a World Cup team without a country|publisher=ESPN|date=2006|access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage of the World Cup]], Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening match to joint group favourites the Netherlands 1\u20130, with [[Arjen Robben]] scoring the only goal of the match. They then lost their second match to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 6\u20130, the side's worst ever international result. With the team's two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches, and was playing for pride alone in their final group match against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], who had also been mathematically eliminated. Despite having a 2\u20130 lead for much of the first half, ''the Elephants'' managed to come back and win 3\u20132, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with a disappointing 0\u20130\u20133 World Cup run to conclude its existence.\n\n===After dissolution===\n{{main|Serbia national football team|Montenegro national football team}}\nA week after Serbia and Montenegro's final match against the Ivory Coast, the [[Football Association of Montenegro]] applied for separate membership to [[UEFA]]. The [[Football Association of Serbia]] was granted Serbia and Montenegro's place in UEFA and [[FIFA]], with the new [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]] playing its first match in August 2006 against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]].

Consequently, the national team did not play its first match as a new country until 23 December 1994, a 2\u20130 friendly defeat to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Porto Alegre]]. This was the first ever team composed of [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] players exclusively, while [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]], a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team's first ever manager. The next match was played only three days later, a 1\u20130 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nDue to the United Nations international sanctions, the team could not take part in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification]], nor the [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying]] process.\n\nOn 31 March 1995, the team recorded its first official win in history, a 1\u20130 friendly against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], simultaneously marking the team's first ever home match, played at [[Stadion Crvena Zvezda]] in [[Belgrade]], and the first ever goal scored, courtesy of [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Slightly more than one year later, the team recorded its first ever win in a [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifying tournament in its first match in such a tournament, a 3\u20131 win over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Shortly after, the team also recorded its biggest win in history, once again against the Faroe Islands, 8\u20131. Yugoslavia finished second in Group 6, just behind [[Spain national football team|Spain]], meaning it had to go through the play-off system in order to qualify. Yugoslavia was paired up with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], and what was believed would be a tough matchup turned out to be an easy win for Yugoslavia, 7\u20131 in [[Budapest]] and 5\u20130 in Belgrade, for an aggregate score of 12\u20131. This was enough to secure Yugoslavia its first ever World Cup appearance as a new country.\n\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n| GK      = [[Ivica Kralj|'''Kralj''']]\n| RB      = [[Zoran Mirkovi\u0107|'''Mirkovi\u0107''']]| \n| RCB     = [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107|'''Komljenovi\u0107''']]\n| LCB     = [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107|'''Mihajlovi\u0107''']]\n| LB      = [[Goran \u0110orovi\u0107|'''\u0110orovi\u0107''']]\n| RWB      = [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107|'''Jokanovi\u0107''']]\n| DM      = [[Branko Brnovi\u0107|'''Brnovi\u0107''']]\n| LWB      = [[\u017deljko Petrovi\u0107|'''Petrovi\u0107''']]\n| RM     = [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107|'''Jugovi\u0107''']]\n| LM     = [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107|'''Stojkovi\u0107''']]\n| SS      = [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107|'''Mijatovi\u0107''']]\n| caption = Yugoslavia's starting XI under coach [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]] in [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Netherlands vs FR Yugoslavia|their 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in the final 16 of the 1998 World Cup]].</small><ref>[https://www.football-lineups.com/match/40245/] Football-Lineups: Netherlands vs Yugoslavia World Cup 1998</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[1998 FIFA World Cup seeding|1998 World Cup seeding]] had Yugoslavia ranked in the 21st position, but the Yugoslav national team went to France as one of the shadow favourites for the World Cup. ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated Yugoslavia could easily be a semi-finalist in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|that year's World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F16FF3D5B0C758EDDAF0894D0494D81 | work=The New York Times | first=George | last=Vecsey | title=Sports of The Times; Scrapbooks Of History For the U.S | date=26 June 1998}}</ref> The justification for such an estimation was partially found in the names of the Yugoslav players, members of great European teams and proven footballers. The draw put the team in Group F alongside [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. Yugoslavia won its first match 1\u20130 against Iran thanks to a goal from defender [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]]. The next match was a draw for Yugoslavia; after leading Germany 2\u20130, last game's hero, Mihajlovi\u0107, scored an unlucky own goal following a German free-kick, and [[Oliver Bierhoff]] equalised at 2\u20132 with only about ten minutes to the match. Nonetheless, Yugoslavia responded in the next match against the United States and won 1\u20130 due to an early goal in [[Nantes]]. Yugoslavia finished second in Group F, for despite finishing level on points with Germany, Germany finished first via a superior goal difference.\n\nFinishing second, Yugoslavia was drawn with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#round of 16|round of 16]]. Yugoslavia entered in the match with a sole attacker, but its defensive tactics proved unsuccessful as [[Dennis Bergkamp]] put the Netherlands in front in the 38th minute. Immediately following the start of the second half, Yugoslavia pressured the Dutch, who inevitably conceded a header from [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107]]. However, the turning point of this match was a penalty awarded to Yugoslavia after [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] was fouled in the penalty area. [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]]'s shot dazzled [[Edwin van der Sar]], but not the crossbar, and the scoreline remained level at 1\u20131. In the late seconds of the match, [[Edgar Davids]] took a shot from 20 metres out which beat goalkeeper [[Ivica Kralj]], to the disbelief of the Yugoslav players and fans. This marked the end of Yugoslavia's run in the World Cup.\n\n====Euro 2000====\n{{see also|UEFA Euro 2000 Group C|UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage}}\nThe draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifiers]] saw many eyebrows raised as first-seeded Yugoslavia was drawn in a group alongside [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], marking the first matches between the two teams after the [[Yugoslav Wars|breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The other teams in the group were the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. When the qualifiers began, the coach was [[Milan \u017divadinovi\u0107]], but in July 1999 he resigned and was replaced by [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]].\n\nThe team started with a 1\u20130 win over Ireland in Belgrade, before beating Malta 3\u20130 in [[Ta' Qali]]. The home fixture against the Maltese followed, but was moved to [[Thessaloniki]], Greece, due to the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. The team nonetheless won 4\u20131. The first, highly anticipated match against Croatia took place in Belgrade shortly after the bombing ended, and was interrupted due to a power outage at the beginning of the second half, resuming after 43 minutes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs/news/1999-08/19/13984.html|title=Serbian Government >> News >> Sports >> FOOTBALL: YUGOSLAVIA - Croatia 0-0|website=www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs}}</ref> and eventually finishing 0\u20130. A 2\u20131 defeat against Ireland in [[Dublin]] was followed by victories home and away against Macedonia (3\u20131 and 4\u20132 respectively), meaning Yugoslavia needed to win its final qualifier against Croatia in [[Zagreb]], or to draw with Ireland failing to beat Macedonia in [[Skopje]], in order to automatically qualify for Euro 2000. As it happened, Ireland conceded an injury-time equaliser, meaning Yugoslavia's 2\u20132 draw with the Croatians was sufficient for automatic qualification.\n\nThe draw for the Euro 2000 final stages placed Yugoslavia in Group C alongside [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and another former Yugoslav republic, [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. The Slovenians took a surprise 3\u20130 lead in the first match at the [[Stade du Pays de Charleroi]], but three goals in six second-half minutes enabled Yugoslavia to secure a 3\u20133 draw. The team then beat Norway 1\u20130 in [[Li\u00e8ge]] thanks to an early Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 backheel strike. The final group match, against Spain in [[Bruges]], saw the Yugoslavs take the lead three times, before a [[Gaizka Mendieta]] penalty and an [[Alfonso P\u00e9rez|Alfonso]] strike in injury-time secured a dramatic 4\u20133 win for the Spaniards and top spot in the group. Yugoslavia nonetheless finished second, level on points with Norway but ranked ahead due to their head-to-head victory in Li\u00e8ge. In each of the three matches, Yugoslavia had one player sent off: [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]] and [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] respectively.\n\nIn the [[UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]], Yugoslavia was once again paired with the Netherlands. However, unlike the last encounter, the co-hosts made easy work of Yugoslavia, winning 6\u20131 in [[Rotterdam]], with [[Patrick Kluivert]] scoring a [[hat-trick]].\n\nOne of the few bright spots of Yugoslav team in the whole tournament was Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who finished as the joint top scorer of the tournament, alongside Patrick Kluivert. Both players scored five goals, although Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played one less match.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | title=Leading goalscorers | work=UEFA.com | publisher=Union of European Football Associations | date=2 July 2000 | accessdate=12 July 2012 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20000711003231/www.euro2000.org/en/tournament/page4/0,1074,,00.html | archivedate=11 July 2000 }}</ref>\n\n====Failure to qualify for 2002 World Cup====\nThe [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification|2002 World Cup qualifiers]] marked the first time Yugoslavia failed to qualify for a major tournament ever since its return to \"big stage\" football after the UN sanctions. The problems began with the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|major political turmoil in the country]] as well in the Yugoslav FA, which prompted new head coach [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] to resign after only one match, a 2\u20130 away victory against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].\n\n[[Milovan \u0110ori\u0107]] took over the team, but under his leadership, the team managed only two draws, 1\u20131 at home against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and 1\u20131 away against Slovenia. In both matches, the opponents equalized in late stages of the match). Yugoslavia then lost 0\u20131 at home to [[Russia national football team|Russia]], marking the nation's first home defeat in official matches. After \u0110ori\u0107's resignation, a three-man commission consisting of [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]] and [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]] took over the coaching duties, until Savi\u0107evi\u0107 ultimately took over on his own. The team managed to bounce back with a draw in Russia and a win in Switzerland, but failed to defeat Slovenia in the penultimate game, thus finishing their qualifying group in third position.\n\n===Ilija Petkovi\u0107 era (2003\u20132006)===\n{{see also|2006 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n[[File:Elfenbeink\u00fcste - Serbien und Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Serbia and Montenegro playing against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] at the [[Allianz Arena]] during the 2006 FIFA World Cup]]\nAfter Savi\u0107evi\u0107's disastrous spell as head coach, the country went under a [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro|political transformation]], and [[Ilija Petkovi\u0107]] became the newly named Serbia and Montenegro's new coach. Initially, the team under his lead experienced dragging failure in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|Euro 2004 qualifiers]] while competing for the first time as Serbia and Montenegro. Despite drawing both matches against group favourites and eventual group winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and winning both matches against group runners-up [[Wales national football team|Wales]], Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to an embarrassing 2\u20132 home draw and 2\u20131 away loss to [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]].\n\nHowever, Serbia and Montenegro qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. Serbia and Montenegro began their 2006 World Cup campaign by finishing first with an undefeated record in their [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] group ahead of favourites Spain. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in its ten matches, the best defensive record out all 51 teams participating in qualification. For the 2006 qualifiers, Serbia and Montenegro was drawn in a group with Spain, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. Led once again by Ilija Petkovi\u0107, Serbia and Montenegro played some impressive defensive football: the \"Famous Four\" defence consisting of [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]], [[Mladen Krstaji\u0107]], [[Goran Gavran\u010di\u0107]] and [[Ivica Dragutinovi\u0107]], with [[Dragoslav Jevri\u0107]] as goalkeeper allowed only one goal in ten matches, finishing first in their group with a 6\u20134\u20130 record.\n\nOn 3 June 2006, following a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]], Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia. As the World Cup was about to start, it was decided that the Serbia and Montenegro team that had qualified for the tournament would compete, with the split into separate teams representing the new countries of Montenegro and Serbia to take place once the team was eliminated from the tournament. Thus, the team played in the tournament representing a state that no longer existed.<ref name=withoutcountry/> Only one Montenegrin-born player, goalkeeper [[Dragoslav Jevri\u0107]], was in the squad.<ref name=withoutcountry>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/wire/_/section/soccer/id/2485949|title=Serbia-Montenegro a World Cup team without a country|publisher=ESPN|date=2006|access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group C|group stage of the World Cup]], Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening match to joint group favourites the Netherlands 1\u20130, with [[Arjen Robben]] scoring the only goal of the match. They then lost their second match to Argentina 6\u20130, the side's worst ever international result. With the team's two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches, and was playing for pride alone in their final group match against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], who had also been mathematically eliminated. Despite having a 2\u20130 lead for much of the first half, ''the Elephants'' managed to come back and win 3\u20132, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with a disappointing 0\u20130\u20133 World Cup run to conclude its existence.\n\n===After dissolution===\n{{main|Serbia national football team|Montenegro national football team}}\nA week after Serbia and Montenegro's final match against the Ivory Coast, the [[Football Association of Montenegro]] applied for separate membership to [[UEFA]]. The [[Football Association of Serbia]] was granted Serbia and Montenegro's place in UEFA and [[FIFA]], with the new [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]] playing its first match in August 2006 against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]].

It is a [[constituent college]] of the [[University of London]]. It was founded in 1891 as '''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute''' by the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] in [[New Cross]], London. It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed '''Goldsmiths' College'''. The word ''College'' was dropped from its branding in 2006, but Goldsmiths' College, with the [[apostrophe]], remains the institution's formal legal name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |title=Rebranding FAQs |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London |quote=it is now known as Goldsmiths, University of London.|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225110856/http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |archivedate = 25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nNearly 20% of students come from outside the UK, and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Goldsmiths Main Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Richard Hoggart]] Building]]\nIn 1891, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], one of the [[City of London]] [[Livery Companies]], founded ''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute'' (more commonly referred to simply as the \"Goldsmiths' Institute\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=5499&inst_id=29 |title=Goldsmiths' College archives |publisher=Aim25.ac.uk |date=29 September 1905 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>). The Goldsmiths' Company was established in the 12th century as a medieval guild for goldsmiths, silversmiths and jewellers. The Livery Company dedicated the foundation of its new Institute to \"the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes\". The original Institute was based in New Cross at the former [[Royal Naval School]] building. (This building, which was designed by the architect [[John Shaw Jr]], is now known as the ''Richard Hoggart Building'' and remains the main building of the campus today.)\n\n[[File:From the Services To Schoolmastering- Re-training at Goldsmith's College, London University, Nottingham, England, 1944 D22754.jpg|thumbnail|left|Goldsmiths College students at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 1944]]\nIn 1904, the Institute was merged with the University of London and was re-established as '''Goldsmiths' College'''. (The apostrophe was removed in 1993, and the word 'College' dropped in a rebranding in 2006). At this point Goldsmiths was the largest teacher training institution in the country. Training functions were later expanded to include refresher courses for teachers, the University Postgraduate Certificate in Education and an Art teacher's Certificate course. The College also ran its own Nursery School.\n\nShortly after the merger, in 1907, Goldsmiths added a new Arts building, designed by Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]], at the back of the main building. During the Second World War it was decided to evacuate the faculty and students of the College to [[University of Nottingham|University College, Nottingham]], a decision which proved wise both at the time and in hindsight, since the main building was struck by an [[incendiary bomb]] and gutted in 1940 (and not finally repaired until 1947).\n\nDuring the 1960s Goldsmiths experienced a rapid expansion in student numbers. It is during this period that Goldsmiths began to establish its reputation in the arts and [[social science]] fields, as well as offering a number of new teacher training qualifications. The original main building was expanded, and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James's Hall were all built to accommodate the influx of new students. The university also acquired a number of historic buildings in the surrounding area, including the splendid former [[Deptford]] [[Town Hall]] and Laurie Grove Baths buildings. The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all retain [[Grade II listed]] building status.\n\nIn 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the [[University of London]] and in 1990 received its [[Royal Charter]]. Among its [[List of Goldsmiths College people#List of Wardens of Goldsmiths|wardens]] have been [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Andrew Rutherford (English scholar)|Andrew Rutherford]] and [[Ben Pimlott]]. The current, and first woman, Warden is Francis Corner.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357165/Revealed-BBC-boss-landed-866k-payoff-walked-straight-public-sector-job.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Revealed: BBC boss who landed \u00a3866k payoff and walked straight into another public-sector job}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the former boiler house and public laundry of Laurie Grove Baths was refurbished and opened as [[Goldsmiths CCA]].\n\nIn August 2019, Goldsmiths announced that it would be removing all beef products from sale and would be charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. The changes were introduced as part of the university's efforts to become carbon neutral by 2025.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-49321560|title=University bans hamburgers 'to help environment'|last=Sellgren|first=Katherine|date=2019-08-12|access-date=2019-08-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Campus and location==\n[[File:Deptford Town Hall Building.jpg|thumb|right|Deptford Town Hall Building]]\nGoldsmiths is situated in [[New Cross]], a highly populated area of south-east London with a considerable art and music scene. The area is served by [[London Overground]] trains at [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]].\n\nThe main building, the ''Richard Hoggart Building'', was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect [[John Shaw, Jr]] (1803\u20131870). The former Deptford Town Hall Building, designed by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester]] and [[Edwin Alfred Rickards]], acquired in 1998, is used for academic seminars and conferences. In addition to this Goldsmiths has built several more modern buildings to develop the campus, including the [[RIBA]] award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the ''Ben Pimlott Building'' designed by [[Will Alsop]] and completed in 2005, and the ''Professor Stuart Hall Building'' (formerly the ''New Academic Building)'' which was completed in 2010.\n\nThe library, or the ''Rutherford Building'', has three floors and gives students access to an extensive range of printed and electronic resources. The third-floor library is believed to house the largest collection of audio-visual material in the UK. Goldsmiths' students, like all other students in the [[University of London]], have full access to the collections at [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] Library at [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.\n\n[[File:Goldsmiths Pimlott Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ben Pimlott]] Building]]\nThe seven-storey ''Ben Pimlott Building'' on New Cross Road, complete with its distinctive \"scribble in the sky\" (made from 229 separate pieces of metal) has become a signature of modern Goldsmiths.

It is a [[constituent college]] of the [[University of London]]. It was founded in 1891 as '''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute''' by the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]] in [[New Cross]], London. It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed '''Goldsmiths' College'''. The word ''College'' was dropped from its branding in 2006, but Goldsmiths' College, with the [[apostrophe]], remains the institution's formal legal name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |title=Rebranding FAQs |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London |quote=it is now known as Goldsmiths, University of London.|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225110856/http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |archivedate = 25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nNearly 20% of students come from outside the UK, and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Goldsmiths Main Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Richard Hoggart]] Building]]\nIn 1891, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], one of the [[City of London]] [[Livery Companies]], founded ''Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute'' (more commonly referred to simply as the \"Goldsmiths' Institute\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=5499&inst_id=29 |title=Goldsmiths' College archives |publisher=Aim25.ac.uk |date=29 September 1905 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>). The Goldsmiths' Company was established in the 12th century as a medieval guild for goldsmiths, silversmiths and jewellers. The Livery Company dedicated the foundation of its new Institute to \"the promotion of technical skill, knowledge, health and general well-being among men and women of the industrial, working and artisan classes\". The original Institute was based in New Cross at the former [[Royal Naval School]] building. (This building, which was designed by the architect [[John Shaw Jr]], is now known as the ''Richard Hoggart Building'' and remains the main building of the campus today.)\n\n[[File:From the Services To Schoolmastering- Re-training at Goldsmith's College, London University, Nottingham, England, 1944 D22754.jpg|thumbnail|left|Goldsmiths College students at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 1944]]\nIn 1904, the Institute was merged with the University of London and was re-established as '''Goldsmiths' College'''. (The apostrophe was removed in 1993, and the word 'College' dropped in a rebranding in 2006). At this point Goldsmiths was the largest teacher training institution in the country. Training functions were later expanded to include refresher courses for teachers, the University Postgraduate Certificate in Education and an Art teacher's Certificate course. The College also ran its own Nursery School.\n\nShortly after the merger, in 1907, Goldsmiths added a new Arts building, designed by Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]], at the back of the main building. During the Second World War it was decided to evacuate the faculty and students of the College to [[University of Nottingham|University College, Nottingham]], a decision which proved wise both at the time and in hindsight, since the main building was struck by an [[incendiary bomb]] and gutted in 1940 (and not finally repaired until 1947).\n\nDuring the 1960s Goldsmiths experienced a rapid expansion in student numbers. It is during this period that Goldsmiths began to establish its reputation in the arts and [[social science]] fields, as well as offering a number of new teacher training qualifications. The original main building was expanded, and the Lockwood Building, Whitehead Building, Education Building, Warmington Tower and St James's Hall were all built to accommodate the influx of new students. The university also acquired a number of historic buildings in the surrounding area, including the splendid former [[Deptford]] [[Town Hall]] and Laurie Grove Baths buildings. The Richard Hoggart Building, Deptford Town Hall and the Laurie Grove Baths all retain [[Grade II listed]] building status.\n\nIn 1988, Goldsmiths became a full College of the [[University of London]] and in 1990 received its [[Royal Charter]]. Among its [[List of Goldsmiths College people#List of Wardens of Goldsmiths|wardens]] have been [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Andrew Rutherford (English scholar)|Andrew Rutherford]] and [[Ben Pimlott]]. The current, and first woman, Warden is Francis Corner.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357165/Revealed-BBC-boss-landed-866k-payoff-walked-straight-public-sector-job.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Revealed: BBC boss who landed \u00a3866k payoff and walked straight into another public-sector job}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the former boiler house and public laundry of Laurie Grove Baths was refurbished and opened as [[Goldsmiths CCA]].\n\nIn August 2019, Goldsmiths announced that it would be removing all beef products from sale and would be charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. The changes were introduced as part of the university's efforts to become carbon neutral by 2025.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-49321560|title=University bans hamburgers 'to help environment'|last=Sellgren|first=Katherine|date=2019-08-12|access-date=2019-08-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Campus and location==\n[[File:Deptford Town Hall Building.jpg|thumb|right|Deptford Town Hall Building]]\nGoldsmiths is situated in [[New Cross]], a highly populated area of south-east London with a considerable art and music scene. The area is served by [[London Overground]] trains at [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]].\n\nThe main building, the ''Richard Hoggart Building'', was originally designed as a school (opened in 1844) by the architect [[John Shaw, Jr]] (1803\u20131870). The former Deptford Town Hall Building, designed by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester]] and [[Edwin Alfred Rickards]], acquired in 1998, is used for academic seminars and conferences. In addition to this Goldsmiths has built several more modern buildings to develop the campus, including the [[RIBA]] award-winning Rutherford Building completed in 1997, the ''Ben Pimlott Building'' designed by [[Will Alsop]] and completed in 2005, and the ''Professor Stuart Hall Building'' (formerly the ''New Academic Building)'' which was completed in 2010.\n\nThe library, or the ''Rutherford Building'', has three floors and gives students access to an extensive range of printed and electronic resources. The third-floor library is believed to house the largest collection of audio-visual material in the UK. Goldsmiths' students, like all other students in the [[University of London]], have full access to the collections at [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] Library at [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.\n\n[[File:Goldsmiths Pimlott Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ben Pimlott]] Building]]\nThe seven-storey ''Ben Pimlott Building'' on New Cross Road, complete with its distinctive \"scribble in the sky\" (made from 229 separate pieces of metal) has become a signature of modern Goldsmiths.

As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d.

Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27.

These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger (G/R. 578) or smaller (G/R. 572) role depending on the size and quantity of perforations.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts).

Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

It was developed specifically to perform trainer and light attack missions, as well as to perform these duties more ideally than the first generation of jet trainers that preceded it. Following a competition, a design submitted by a team comprising [[Breguet Aviation]], Dassault Aviation, and Dornier Flugzeugwerke, initially designated as the ''TA501'', was selected and subsequently produced as the Alpha Jet.\n\nBoth the [[French Air Force]] and [[German Air Force]] procured the Alpha Jet in large numbers, the former principally as a trainer aircraft and the latter choosing to use it as a light attack platform. As a result of post-[[Cold War]] military cutbacks, Germany elected to retire its own fleet of Alpha Jets in the 1990s and has re-sold many of these aircraft to both military and civilian operators. The Alpha Jet has been adopted by a number of air forces across the world and has also seen active combat use by some of these operators.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Alpha Jet - Red Bull - ILA2002.jpg|thumb|Alpha Jet owned by [[Red Bull]]]]\n\nIn the early 1960s, European air forces began to consider their requirements for the coming decades. One such area of consideration was the requirement for a new generation of jet-powered trainer aircraft to replace such aircraft as the US-built [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]] and French-built [[Fouga Magister]]. Britain and France established a collaborative program to pursue development of what was initially intended to become a [[supersonic]] jet aircraft. This aircraft was to be produced in two distinct variants for different roles: trainer and [[light attack aircraft]]. The result of this collaboration, the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], proved to be an excellent aircraft, but its definition had changed in the interim, and the type emerged as a full-sized, nuclear-capable [[strike fighter]], whose two-seat variants were used for operational conversion to the type. As such, the Jaguar was not well suited for the general training mission.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\">[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/alpha-jet.html?L=1 \"Alpha Jet.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515212126/http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/alpha-jet.html?L=1 |date=2012-05-15 }} ''Dassault.'' Retrieved: 30 December 2012.</ref>\n\nThis left the original requirement unfulfilled; as a result of this outcome, in 1967, France entered into a series of discussions with West Germany on the topic of a prospective collaboration effort to meet this demand.<ref name = \"kocs 112\">Kocs 1995, p. 112.</ref> West Germany was keen to participate in such talks, having long held an interest in conducting joint training operations with France along with a desire for strengthening positive political relations between the two nations.<ref>Kocs 1995, pp. 112-113.</ref> France also valued military cooperation with West Germany, wanting to break a perceived German ideological preference for American aircraft.<ref name = \"kocs 113\">Kocs 1995, p. 113.</ref> In 1968, a joint specification was produced out of these talks. One substantial change to the requirements was that the sought trainer was now specified to be subsonic, supersonic trainer aircraft having proven to be superfluous to practical requirements. In July 1969, a joint development and production agreement was signed between West Germany and France; under the terms of this agreement, the two nations committed to purchasing 200 aircraft, these being domestically assembled in each of their own countries.<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\"/><ref name = \"lamb 264\"/>\n\nAt one point, both the German government and the German Air Force had been keen to relocate pilot training activities from the United States to France as part of the project. In 1971, however, this was abandoned over fears of a hostile US reaction and West Germany's offset obligations to the United States making such a move unpalatable.<ref>Kocs 1995, pp. 112-114.</ref> While the joint Franco-German training proposal was abandoned, the German government felt obligated to proceed with the aircraft program; at the time, Germany did not require a new trainer aircraft, but it did have a need for a replacement for its fleet of [[Fiat G.91]] attack aircraft.<ref>Kocs 1995, pp. 113-114.</ref> Accordingly, Germany proposed that the aircraft be built in two distinct versions, as an inexpensive trainer for the French requirement, and as a [[close air support]] platform for the German requirement; this position was accepted by France. An initial point of contention whether to use a French or American powerplant for the aircraft was also settled, with France agreeing to solely finance the development of the French-built Larzac engine while Germany agreed to adopt the same powerplant.<ref name = \"kocs 114\"/><ref name = \"lamb 264\">Lambert 1974, p. 264.</ref>\n\nA total of three groups of manufacturers produced proposals in response to the requirement; these were Dassault, Breguet and Dornier submitted the \"TA501\", which had been developed through a merger of the Breguet 126 and Dornier P.375 concepts, VFW-Fokker submitted their \"VFT-291\" aircraft, while SNIAS/MBB submitted the \"E.650 Eurotrainer\".<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\">Braybrook 1984, p. 270.</ref> Each of these proposals were to be powered by twin [[SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac]] [[turbofan]] engines.<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\"/> The German Air Force had insisted that the trainer have two engines after having suffered from severe aircraft attrition rates due to the high accident rate of the single-engine [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]].\n\n===Into production===\n[[File:Patrouille-de-france-alpha-jet-dessous.jpg|thumb|A French Alpha Jet of the [[Patrouille de France]] flight display team]]\nOn 23 July 1970, the Breguet-Dassault-Dornier TA501 was declared the winner of the competition.<ref>Lambert 1974, pp. 264-265.</ref> In February 1971, the project definition phase was formally completed and the integrated design team was formally set up at [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Paris]], France; that same month, a join Franco-German protocol was signed, launching the construction of four prototypes.<ref name = \"lamb 265\">Lambert 1974, p. 265.</ref> In February 1972, the approval to proceed with full development was issued.<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\"/><ref name = \"kocs 114\"/> In May 1972, the first project meeting was held in [[Bordeaux]], at which the order for the four prototypes was formally placed. By November 1972, the project had passed its first mock-up review.<ref name = \"lamb 265\"/> Dassault was designated as the 'pilot' company for the project and possessed final authority on design and management decisions, this approach to project management has been claimed to have been a mostly efficient manner of running the program.<ref name = \"kocs 115\">Kocs 1995, p. 115.</ref>\n\nTwo prototypes were to be built by Dassault in France (Dassault having bought out Breguet in the meantime) and a further two were to be built by Dornier in Germany. On 26 October 1973, the first French prototype performed its first flight at [[Istres Air Base|Istres]], [[Marseille]]; on 9 January 1974, the first German prototype conducted its [[maiden flight]] from [[Oberpfaffenhofen]], [[Bavaria]]. The remaining two prototypes were in the air before the end of 1974.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\"/> The first and second prototypes were used to explore the aircraft's [[flight envelope]], the third prototype was fitted with the French trainer equipment fit and the fourth with the German close air support equipment.<ref name = \"lamb 265\"/> The prototypes were equipped with recording and [[telemetry]] equipment packages, allowing for instrumentation readings and other useful data to be received on the ground in real time during test flights.<ref name = \"lamb 266\"/>\n\nManufacture of Alpha Jet sub-assemblies was divided between France (Dassault), Germany (Dornier) and Belgium ([[SABCA]]), each country performing final assembly and checkout of the type in separate facilities. Dassault hosted the largest of these three assembly lines, typically producing 13 aircraft per month to meet the needs of French and export customers, it was reportedly capable of a maximum output of 15 Alpha Jets per month; the Dornier final assembly line typically maintained a maximum rate of six aircraft per month.<ref name = \"flight manuf 1978\"/> In contrast to the final assembly arrangements, none of the three sources duplicated the manufacture of any component: Dassault-Breguet produced the front and center fuselage, Dornier constructed the wing, tail and rear fuselage, while SABCA manufactured the nose and [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] of the aircraft.<ref name = \"flight manuf 1978\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%202955.html \"Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803101316/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%202955.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 8 November 1978. p. 1882.</ref> A total of 4,500 people were employed in the manufacturing of the Alpha Jet in Germany, an equal number in France also worked on the programme.<ref name = \"flight 1148\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200756.html \"Alpha Jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803214506/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200756.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 1 May 1976. p. 1148.</ref>\n\nBoth Belgium and Egypt, who were early export customers for the Alpha Jet, domestically performed the final assembly of their French-configuration Alpha Jet E aircraft. On 17 September 1978, Dassault and the [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]] (AOI) signed a [[Licensed production|license manufacturing]] agreement for the Alpha Jet; Egyptian assembly work was carried out in a facility in [[Helwan]], [[Egypt]].<ref name = \"flight 1978\"/> In July 1978, Dassault signed an agreement with American aircraft manufacture [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] to market the Alpha Jet in the US market, the arrangement included provisions for Lockheed to manufacture the Alpha Jet under license. It was considered as a candidate for the US Navy's VTXTS advanced trainer program (eventually won by the [[McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk]], a modified version of the [[Hawker Siddeley Hawk]]); proposed modifications included undercarriage changes for nose-tow catapults and a stronger arrestor hook, as well as various US-sourced avionics and other equipment.<ref name = \"flight 1978\"/>\n\nOn 4 November 1977, the first production aircraft made its first flight.<ref name = \"flight manuf 1978\"/> In September 1978, deliveries of production Alpha Jets formally commenced.<ref name = \"kocs 114\"/> The four prototypes remained in service as flying testbeds, being used for further development of the type such as to evaluate a [[composite material|composite]] graphite-epoxy wing and improved versions of the Larzac engine.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\"/> Prototype 01 was specifically used early on to support the development of the Larzac engine.<ref name = \"flight 1148\"/> The different avionics fit makes French and German Alpha Jets relatively easy to visually distinguish the two, with French planes featuring a rounded-off nose and German ones featuring a sharp, pointed nose.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\"/>\n\n===Further development===\nIn 1980, work began on an \"Alternate Close Support\" version of the Alpha Jet, featuring a SAGEM ULISS 81 INS, a Thomson-CSF VE-110 HUD, a TMV630 laser rangefinder in a modified nose and a TRT AHV 9 radio altimeter, with all avionics linked through a digital databus. Initial flight was on 9 April 1982. Cameroon obtained seven (some sources claim 6){{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and Egypt obtained 15.

It was developed specifically to perform trainer and light attack missions, as well as to perform these duties more ideally than the first generation of jet trainers that preceded it. Following a competition, a design submitted by a team comprising [[Breguet Aviation]], Dassault Aviation, and Dornier Flugzeugwerke, initially designated as the ''TA501'', was selected and subsequently produced as the Alpha Jet.\n\nBoth the [[French Air Force]] and [[German Air Force]] procured the Alpha Jet in large numbers, the former principally as a trainer aircraft and the latter choosing to use it as a light attack platform. As a result of post-[[Cold War]] military cutbacks, Germany elected to retire its own fleet of Alpha Jets in the 1990s and has re-sold many of these aircraft to both military and civilian operators. The Alpha Jet has been adopted by a number of air forces across the world and has also seen active combat use by some of these operators.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Alpha Jet - Red Bull - ILA2002.jpg|thumb|Alpha Jet owned by [[Red Bull]]]]\n\nIn the early 1960s, European air forces began to consider their requirements for the coming decades. One such area of consideration was the requirement for a new generation of jet-powered trainer aircraft to replace such aircraft as the US-built [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]] and French-built [[Fouga Magister]]. Britain and France established a collaborative program to pursue development of what was initially intended to become a [[supersonic]] jet aircraft. This aircraft was to be produced in two distinct variants for different roles: trainer and [[light attack aircraft]]. The result of this collaboration, the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], proved to be an excellent aircraft, but its definition had changed in the interim, and the type emerged as a full-sized, nuclear-capable [[strike fighter]], whose two-seat variants were used for operational conversion to the type. As such, the Jaguar was not well suited for the general training mission.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\">[http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/alpha-jet.html?L=1 \"Alpha Jet.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515212126/http://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/alpha-jet.html?L=1 |date=2012-05-15 }} ''Dassault.'' Retrieved: 30 December 2012.</ref>\n\nThis left the original requirement unfulfilled; as a result of this outcome, in 1967, France entered into a series of discussions with West Germany on the topic of a prospective collaboration effort to meet this demand.<ref name = \"kocs 112\">Kocs 1995, p. 112.</ref> West Germany was keen to participate in such talks, having long held an interest in conducting joint training operations with France along with a desire for strengthening positive political relations between the two nations.<ref>Kocs 1995, pp. 112-113.</ref> France also valued military cooperation with West Germany, wanting to break a perceived German ideological preference for American aircraft.<ref name = \"kocs 113\">Kocs 1995, p. 113.</ref> In 1968, a joint specification was produced out of these talks. One substantial change to the requirements was that the sought trainer was now specified to be subsonic, supersonic trainer aircraft having proven to be superfluous to practical requirements. In July 1969, a joint development and production agreement was signed between West Germany and France; under the terms of this agreement, the two nations committed to purchasing 200 aircraft, these being domestically assembled in each of their own countries.<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\"/><ref name = \"lamb 264\"/>\n\nAt one point, both the German government and the German Air Force had been keen to relocate pilot training activities from the United States to France as part of the project. In 1971, however, this was abandoned over fears of a hostile US reaction and West Germany's offset obligations to the United States making such a move unpalatable.<ref>Kocs 1995, pp. 112-114.</ref> While the joint Franco-German training proposal was abandoned, the German government felt obligated to proceed with the aircraft program; at the time, Germany did not require a new trainer aircraft, but it did have a need for a replacement for its fleet of [[Fiat G.91]] attack aircraft.<ref>Kocs 1995, pp. 113-114.</ref> Accordingly, Germany proposed that the aircraft be built in two distinct versions, as an inexpensive trainer for the French requirement, and as a [[close air support]] platform for the German requirement; this position was accepted by France. An initial point of contention whether to use a French or American powerplant for the aircraft was also settled, with France agreeing to solely finance the development of the French-built Larzac engine while Germany agreed to adopt the same powerplant.<ref name = \"kocs 114\"/><ref name = \"lamb 264\">Lambert 1974, p. 264.</ref>\n\nA total of three groups of manufacturers produced proposals in response to the requirement; these were Dassault, Breguet and Dornier submitted the \"TA501\", which had been developed through a merger of the Breguet 126 and Dornier P.375 concepts, VFW-Fokker submitted their \"VFT-291\" aircraft, while SNIAS/MBB submitted the \"E.650 Eurotrainer\".<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\">Braybrook 1984, p. 270.</ref> Each of these proposals were to be powered by twin [[SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac]] [[turbofan]] engines.<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\"/> The German Air Force had insisted that the trainer have two engines after having suffered from severe aircraft attrition rates due to the high accident rate of the single-engine [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]].\n\n===Into production===\n[[File:Patrouille-de-france-alpha-jet-dessous.jpg|thumb|A French Alpha Jet of the [[Patrouille de France]] flight display team]]\nOn 23 July 1970, the Breguet-Dassault-Dornier TA501 was declared the winner of the competition.<ref>Lambert 1974, pp. 264-265.</ref> In February 1971, the project definition phase was formally completed and the integrated design team was formally set up at [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Paris]], France; that same month, a join Franco-German protocol was signed, launching the construction of four prototypes.<ref name = \"lamb 265\">Lambert 1974, p. 265.</ref> In February 1972, the approval to proceed with full development was issued.<ref name=\"AIjun84 p270\"/><ref name = \"kocs 114\"/> In May 1972, the first project meeting was held in [[Bordeaux]], at which the order for the four prototypes was formally placed. By November 1972, the project had passed its first mock-up review.<ref name = \"lamb 265\"/> Dassault was designated as the 'pilot' company for the project and possessed final authority on design and management decisions, this approach to project management has been claimed to have been a mostly efficient manner of running the program.<ref name = \"kocs 115\">Kocs 1995, p. 115.</ref>\n\nTwo prototypes were to be built by Dassault in France (Dassault having bought out Breguet in the meantime) and a further two were to be built by Dornier in Germany. On 26 October 1973, the first French prototype performed its first flight at [[Istres Air Base|Istres]], [[Marseille]]; on 9 January 1974, the first German prototype conducted its [[maiden flight]] from [[Oberpfaffenhofen]], [[Bavaria]]. The remaining two prototypes were in the air before the end of 1974.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\"/> The first and second prototypes were used to explore the aircraft's [[flight envelope]], the third prototype was fitted with the French trainer equipment fit and the fourth with the German close air support equipment.<ref name = \"lamb 265\"/> The prototypes were equipped with recording and [[telemetry]] equipment packages, allowing for instrumentation readings and other useful data to be received on the ground in real time during test flights.<ref name = \"lamb 266\"/>\n\nManufacture of Alpha Jet sub-assemblies was divided between France (Dassault), Germany (Dornier) and Belgium ([[SABCA]]), each country performing final assembly and checkout of the type in separate facilities. Dassault hosted the largest of these three assembly lines, typically producing 13 aircraft per month to meet the needs of French and export customers, it was reportedly capable of a maximum output of 15 Alpha Jets per month; the Dornier final assembly line typically maintained a maximum rate of six aircraft per month.<ref name = \"flight manuf 1978\"/> In contrast to the final assembly arrangements, none of the three sources duplicated the manufacture of any component: Dassault-Breguet produced the front and center fuselage, Dornier constructed the wing, tail and rear fuselage, while SABCA manufactured the nose and [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] of the aircraft.<ref name = \"flight manuf 1978\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%202955.html \"Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803101316/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%202955.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 8 November 1978. p. 1882.</ref> A total of 4,500 people were employed in the manufacturing of the Alpha Jet in Germany, an equal number in France also worked on the programme.<ref name = \"flight 1148\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200756.html \"Alpha Jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803214506/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200756.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 1 May 1976. p. 1148.</ref>\n\nBoth Belgium and Egypt, who were early export customers for the Alpha Jet, domestically performed the final assembly of their French-configuration Alpha Jet E aircraft. On 17 September 1978, Dassault and the [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]] (AOI) signed a [[Licensed production|license manufacturing]] agreement for the Alpha Jet; Egypian assembly work was carried out in a facility in [[Helwan]], [[Egypt]].<ref name = \"flight 1978\"/> In July 1978, Dassault signed an agreement with American aircraft manufacture [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] to market the Alpha Jet in the US market, the arrangement included provisions for Lockheed to manufacture the Alpha Jet under license. It was considered as a candidate for the US Navy's VTXTS advanced trainer program (eventually won by the [[McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk]], a modified version of the [[Hawker Siddeley Hawk]]); proposed modifications included undercarriage changes for nose-tow catapults and a stronger arrestor hook, as well as various US-sourced avionics and other equipment.<ref name = \"flight 1978\"/>\n\nOn 4 November 1977, the first production aircraft made its first flight.<ref name = \"flight manuf 1978\"/> In September 1978, deliveries of production Alpha Jets formally commenced.<ref name = \"kocs 114\"/> The four prototypes remained in service as flying testbeds, being used for further development of the type such as to evaluate a [[composite material|composite]] graphite-epoxy wing and improved versions of the Larzac engine.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\"/> Prototype 01 was specifically used early on to support the development of the Larzac engine.<ref name = \"flight 1148\"/> The different avionics fit makes French and German Alpha Jets relatively easy to visually distinguish the two, with French planes featuring a rounded-off nose and German ones featuring a sharp, pointed nose.<ref name=\"Alpha Jet\"/>\n\n===Further development===\nIn 1980, work began on an \"Alternate Close Support\" version of the Alpha Jet, featuring a SAGEM ULISS 81 INS, a Thomson-CSF VE-110 HUD, a TMV630 laser rangefinder in a modified nose and a TRT AHV 9 radio altimeter, with all avionics linked through a digital databus. Initial flight was on 9 April 1982. Cameroon obtained seven (some sources claim 6){{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and Egypt obtained 15. As with the original Egyptian order for MS1 machines, Dassault provided four such machines under the designation of ''MS2'' and AOI of Egypt assembled the other eleven from knockdown kits.<ref name = \"flight 1988\"/>\n\nThe ''Alpha Jet 2'', originally the ''Alpha Jet NGEA'' (''Nouvelle Generation Appui/Ecole'' or \"New Generation Attack/Training\") was a proposed development of the Alpha Jet. It featured the basic avionics of the MS2 plus compatibility with the advanced French [[Matra Magic]] 2 AAMs and the more powerful Larzac 04-C20 turbofans refitted to Luftwaffe Alpha Jet A aircraft. Some of the aircraft's new avionics were derived from the [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] fighter.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201089.html \"New-generation trainer/attack Alpha Jet flight-tested.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803105145/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201089.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 24 April 1982. p. 1033.</ref><ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201199.html \"Warlike Jets.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803111144/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201199.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 2 July 1983. p. 27.</ref><ref name = \"flight 1988 36\"/> In 1982, it was claimed that the Alpha Jet NGEA was the \"only existing aircraft in its category featuring a completely integrated digital navigation and attack system\".<ref name = \"ngea public\"/> While no new-build aircraft were produced of this variant, existing Egyptian Alpha Jets were reportedly upgraded to a similar standard.<ref name = \"flight 1988\"/> A single prototype was flown, presumably a modification of one of the original Alpha Jet prototypes.

This proposal was intended to perform all-weather ground attack operations, as well as to perform [[anti-surface warfare|anti-shipping]] and anti-[[helicopter]] missions.<ref name = \"flight 1988\"/><ref name = \"flight 1988 36\"/> Featured many of the same systems as the ''Alpha Jet 2'', it also was to be equipped with twin cockpit multifunction displays (MFDs) and potential carriage of AGAVE or Anemone radar, a [[forward-looking infrared]] (FLIR) imager, a laser targeting system and a modern countermeasures suite.<ref name = \"flight 1988\"/> A prototype was also flown, again presumably an upgrade of an original Alpha Jet prototype.\n\nIn June 1985, Dornier announced that it was studying its own third generation Alpha Jet upgrade program, independent of Dassault. This proposed upgrade involved substantial avionics upgrades and [[user interface|man-machine interface]] alterations, such as the addition of multiple [[head-up display]]s (HUDs) to allow instructors to view what students are viewing, with the aim of being more suited for the sophisticated requirements of modern and impending fighter aircraft; Dornier had judged the Alpha Jet's airframe itself to have been suitable without modification for future market needs.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%202045.html \"New Alpha Jet shown.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803111352/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%202045.html |date=2016-08-03 }} ''Flight International'', 22 June 1985. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn September 1988, Dassault revealed that it had proposed a navalised variant of the Alpha Jet as a carrier-based trainer to the [[French Naval Aviation]] as a replacement for their [[Fouga CM.175 Z\u00e9phyr]] and [[Dassault \u00c9tendard IV]] fleets.<ref name = \"flight 1988\"/> Designated ''Alpha Jet Maritime 3'', it was promoted as having been fully navalised and fitted with the avionics intended for the ''Alpha Jet 3 Advanced Training System'' to give it compatibility with the upcoming next generation of carrier fighter aircraft.
