On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring the 1920s, Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational and social life. Literacy was greatly improved, and a standard literary language was introduced by imposing Russian on the populace. Economic and social development also was notable. Many aspects of the Kyrgyz national culture were retained despite the suppression of nationalist activity under [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nThe early years of [[glasnost]] had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, ''Literaturny Kirghizstan'', by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.\n\nAccording to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the [[Jewish Autonomous Republic]]).\n\n[[File:Stamps of Kyrgyzstan, 2011-05.jpg|thumb|[[Urial]] on a Kyrgyzstan stamp]]\nIn June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Oblast]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<ref name=\"conflict\">{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33728 |title=KYRGYZSTAN: Economic disparities driving inter-ethnic conflict |publisher=[[IRIN]] Asia |date=15 February 2006}}</ref> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek [[Collective farming|collective farms]] for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]].

On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.\n\nDespite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a \"renewed federation\". Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.\n\nOn 19 August 1991, when the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|State Emergency Committee]] assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President [[German Kuznetsov]] announced their resignations from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the '''Republic of Kyrgyzstan'''.\n\n===Independence===\n{{Recentism|date=September 2012}}\nIn October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent Republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community. Finally, on 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Kyrgyzstan gained full independence a few days later on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nIn 2005, a popular uprising known as the \"[[Tulip Revolution]]\", took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forced President [[Askar Akayev]]'s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was formed under President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and Prime Minister [[Feliks Kulov]]. The nation's capital was looted during the protests.\n\nPolitical stability appeared to be elusive, however, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to [[organized crime]] jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother's seat in a by-election. All four are reputed to have been directly involved in major illegal business ventures.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}}\nOn 6 April 2010, [[2010 Kyrgyzstan revolution|civil unrest broke out]] in the town of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] after a demonstration against government corruption and increased living expenses.

It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39\u00b0]] and [[44th parallel north|44\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[69th meridian east|69\u00b0]] and [[81st meridian east|81\u00b0 E]]. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into [[endorheic basin|closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea]]. The mountainous region of the [[Tian Shan]] covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as \"the Switzerland of Central Asia\", as a result),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/GC26Ag03.html | title = The Tulip Revolution takes root | first = Pepe | last = Escobar| date = 26 March 2005 |publisher = Asia Times Online}}</ref> with the remainder made up of valleys and basins.\n[[File:Kyrgyzstan.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of Kyrgyzstan]]\n\n[[Issyk-Kul Lake]], or Ysyk-K\u00f6l in [[Kyrgyz Language|Kyrgyz]], in the north-eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after [[Titicaca]].

Peak [[Jengish Chokusu]], at {{convert|7439|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for [[hydro-electricity]].\n\nKyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including [[gold]] and [[rare-earth metals]]. Due to the country's predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the [[Fergana Valley]].\n\n[[Bishkek]] in the north is the capital and largest city, with 937,400 inhabitants ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}). The second city is the ancient town of [[Osh]], located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan. The principal river is the [[Kara Darya]], which flows west through the Fergana Valley into Uzbekistan. Across the border in Uzbekistan it meets another major Kyrgyz river, the [[Naryn River|Naryn]].\n\nThe confluence forms the [[Syr Darya]], which originally flowed into the [[Aral Sea]]. {{As of|2010}}, it no longer reaches the sea, as its water is withdrawn upstream to irrigate cotton fields in [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and southern [[Kazakhstan]].

Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless [[coup]] on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] (see: [[Tulip Revolution]]).\n\nOn 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the [[Kyrgyz presidential election, 2005|presidential election]] in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country's constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6124428.stm | title = Clashes erupt in Kyrgyz capital|accessdate = 21 November 2007 |work = BBC Online | date=7 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin and Sooronbay Jeenbekov (2018-05-14) 01.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]] and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], 14 May 2018]]\nKyrgyzstan is also a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), a league of 56 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia.

Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic's transition to a demand economy.\n\nThe government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a [[value-added tax]]. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a [[market economy]]. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 20 December 1998.\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Tajikistan]], as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] revenues and providing an adequate [[social safety net]]. [[Remittance]]s of around 800,000 Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia represent 40% of Kyrgyzstan's GDP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6373KT20100408 |title=Kyrgyz unrest plays into regional rivalry |work=Reuters |date=8 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |title=Kyrgyzstan: Returning Labor Migrants are a Cause for Concern |publisher=EurasiaNet.org |date=2 April 2009 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104050/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] is an important sector of the economy in Kyrgyzstan (see [[agriculture in Kyrgyzstan]]). By the early 1990s, the private agricultural sector provided between one-third and one-half of some harvests. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 35.6% of GDP and about half of employment. Kyrgyzstan's terrain is mountainous, which accommodates [[livestock]] raising, the largest agricultural activity, so the resulting [[wool]], [[meat]] and [[dairy product]]s are major commodities. Main crops include [[wheat]], [[sugar beets]], [[potatoes]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[vegetables]], and [[fruit]]. As the prices of imported [[agrichemicals]] and [[petroleum]] are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.\n\nKyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of [[coal]], [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[antimony]], and other valuable metals. [[Metallurgy]] is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the [[Kumtor Gold Mine]] and other regions. The country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of [[hydroelectric energy]].\n\nThe principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].

It is required that every child finishes 9 grades of school and receives a certificate of completion. Grades 10\u201311 are optional, but it is necessary to complete them to graduate and receive a state-accredited school diploma. To graduate, a student must complete the 11-year school course and pass 4 mandatory state exams in writing, maths, history and a foreign language.\n\nThere are 77 public schools in Bishkek (capital city) and more than 200 in the rest of the country. There are 55 higher educational institutions and universities in Kyrgyzstan, out of which 37 are state institutions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn September 2016, the [[University of Central Asia]] was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucentralasia.org |title=University of Central Asia \u2013 University of Central Asia |publisher=Ucentralasia.org |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:E8102-Bishkek-West-Bus-Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Bishkek West Bus Terminal]]\n{{Main|Transport in Kyrgyzstan}}\nTransport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country's alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.\n\nAdditional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. [[Horse]]s are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan's road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported [[fuel]].\n\n===Airports===\nAt the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The [[Kyrgyzstan Air Company]] provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.\n* [[Manas International Airport]] near [[Bishkek]] is the main international airport, with services to Moscow, [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], [[Urumqi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Baku]], and [[Dubai]].\n* [[Osh Airport]] is the main air terminal in the south of the country, with daily connections to Bishkek, and services to Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Almaty and more international places.\n* [[Jalal-Abad Airport]] is linked to Bishkek by daily flights. The national flag carrier, Kyrgyzstan, operates flights on [[BAe-146]] aircraft. During the summer months, a weekly flight links Jalal-Abad with the Issyk-Kul Region.\n* Other facilities built during the Soviet era are either closed down, used only occasionally or restricted to military use (e.g., [[Kant Air Base]] near Bishkek, which is used by the [[Russian Air Force]]).\n\n===Banned airline status===\nKyrgyzstan appears on the European Union's [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union|list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines]]. This means that no airline which is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards which fail to meet European regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:102:0003:0016:EN:PDF |title=List of banned European Union air carriers |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> No EU airline has flights to Kyrgyzstan (as of 2020). Travel between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan includes changing aircraft, most often in Moscow or Istanbul.\n\n===Railways===\nThe [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Ferghana valley]] in the south were endpoints of the [[Soviet Union]]'s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about {{convert|370|km|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1520|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], and the cities of Russia.\n\nThere are vague plans about extending rail lines from [[Balykchy]] in the north and/or from [[Osh]] in the south into China, but the cost of construction would be enormous.\n\n====Rail links with adjacent countries====\n* [[Transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Bishkek]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Osh]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] \u2013 no \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|China]] \u2013 no \u2013 [[Break of gauge]] 1524&nbsp;mm/1435&nbsp;mm\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Osh 03-2016 img07 Gapar Aitiev Street.jpg|thumb|Street scene in [[Osh]].]]\nWith support from the [[Asian Development Bank]], a major road linking the north and southwest from [[Bishkek]] to [[Osh]] has recently been completed.

On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring the 1920s, Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational and social life. Literacy was greatly improved, and a standard literary language was introduced by imposing Russian on the populace. Economic and social development also was notable. Many aspects of the Kyrgyz national culture were retained despite the suppression of nationalist activity under [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nThe early years of [[glasnost]] had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, ''Literaturny Kirghizstan'', by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.\n\nAccording to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the [[Jewish Autonomous Republic]]).\n\n[[File:Stamps of Kyrgyzstan, 2011-05.jpg|thumb|[[Urial]] on a Kyrgyzstan stamp]]\nIn June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Oblast]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<ref name=\"conflict\">{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33728 |title=KYRGYZSTAN: Economic disparities driving inter-ethnic conflict |publisher=[[IRIN]] Asia |date=15 February 2006}}</ref> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek [[Collective farming|collective farms]] for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]].

On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.\n\nDespite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a \"renewed federation\". Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.\n\nOn 19 August 1991, when the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|State Emergency Committee]] assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President [[German Kuznetsov]] announced their resignations from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the '''Republic of Kyrgyzstan'''.\n\n===Independence===\n{{Recentism|date=September 2012}}\nIn October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent Republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community. Finally, on 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Kyrgyzstan gained full independence a few days later on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nIn 2005, a popular uprising known as the \"[[Tulip Revolution]]\", took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forced President [[Askar Akayev]]'s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was formed under President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and Prime Minister [[Feliks Kulov]]. The nation's capital was looted during the protests.\n\nPolitical stability appeared to be elusive, however, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to [[organized crime]] jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother's seat in a by-election.

It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39\u00b0]] and [[44th parallel north|44\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[69th meridian east|69\u00b0]] and [[81st meridian east|81\u00b0 E]]. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into [[endorheic basin|closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea]]. The mountainous region of the [[Tian Shan]] covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as \"the Switzerland of Central Asia\", as a result),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/GC26Ag03.html | title = The Tulip Revolution takes root | first = Pepe | last = Escobar| date = 26 March 2005 |publisher = Asia Times Online}}</ref> with the remainder made up of valleys and basins.\n[[File:Kyrgyzstan.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of Kyrgyzstan]]\n\n[[Issyk-Kul Lake]], or Ysyk-K\u00f6l in [[Kyrgyz Language|Kyrgyz]], in the north-eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after [[Titicaca]]. The highest peaks are in the Kakshaal-Too range, forming the Chinese border. Peak [[Jengish Chokusu]], at {{convert|7439|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for [[hydro-electricity]].\n\nKyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including [[gold]] and [[rare-earth metals]]. Due to the country's predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the [[Fergana Valley]].\n\n[[Bishkek]] in the north is the capital and largest city, with 937,400 inhabitants ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}). The second city is the ancient town of [[Osh]], located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan. The principal river is the [[Kara Darya]], which flows west through the Fergana Valley into Uzbekistan. Across the border in Uzbekistan it meets another major Kyrgyz river, the [[Naryn River|Naryn]].\n\nThe confluence forms the [[Syr Darya]], which originally flowed into the [[Aral Sea]]. {{As of|2010}}, it no longer reaches the sea, as its water is withdrawn upstream to irrigate cotton fields in [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and southern [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chu River]] also briefly flows through Kyrgyzstan before entering Kazakhstan.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Kyrgyzstan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Kyrgyzstan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]\n{{Main|Climate of Kyrgyzstan}}\nThe climate varies regionally.

The executive branch includes a president and prime minister. The parliament currently is unicameral. The judicial branch comprises a Supreme Court, local courts and a Chief Prosecutor.\n\nIn March 2002, in the southern district of [[Aksy]], five people protesting the arbitrary arrest of an opposition politician were shot dead by police, sparking nationwide protests. President [[Askar Akayev]] initiated a constitutional reform process which initially included the participation of a broad range of government, civil and social representatives in an open dialogue, leading to a February 2003 referendum marred by voting irregularities.\n\nThe amendments to the constitution approved by the referendum resulted in stronger control by the president and weakened the parliament and the Constitutional Court. Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless [[coup]] on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] (see: [[Tulip Revolution]]).\n\nOn 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the [[Kyrgyz presidential election, 2005|presidential election]] in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country's constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6124428.stm | title = Clashes erupt in Kyrgyz capital|accessdate = 21 November 2007 |work = BBC Online | date=7 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin and Sooronbay Jeenbekov (2018-05-14) 01.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]] and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], 14 May 2018]]\nKyrgyzstan is also a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), a league of 56 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia.

Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic's transition to a demand economy.\n\nThe government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a [[value-added tax]]. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a [[market economy]]. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 20 December 1998.\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Tajikistan]], as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] revenues and providing an adequate [[social safety net]]. [[Remittance]]s of around 800,000 Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia represent 40% of Kyrgyzstan's GDP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6373KT20100408 |title=Kyrgyz unrest plays into regional rivalry |work=Reuters |date=8 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |title=Kyrgyzstan: Returning Labor Migrants are a Cause for Concern |publisher=EurasiaNet.org |date=2 April 2009 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104050/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] is an important sector of the economy in Kyrgyzstan (see [[agriculture in Kyrgyzstan]]). By the early 1990s, the private agricultural sector provided between one-third and one-half of some harvests. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 35.6% of GDP and about half of employment. Kyrgyzstan's terrain is mountainous, which accommodates [[livestock]] raising, the largest agricultural activity, so the resulting [[wool]], [[meat]] and [[dairy product]]s are major commodities. Main crops include [[wheat]], [[sugar beets]], [[potatoes]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[vegetables]], and [[fruit]]. As the prices of imported [[agrichemicals]] and [[petroleum]] are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.\n\nKyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of [[coal]], [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[antimony]], and other valuable metals. [[Metallurgy]] is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the [[Kumtor Gold Mine]] and other regions. The country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of [[hydroelectric energy]].\n\nThe principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. After Beijing launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, China has expanded its economic presence and initiated a number of sizable infrastructure projects in Kyrgyzstan.<ref>Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \u201c[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329310641 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia]\u201d, in Fanny M.

As of August 2019, Bivol is ranked as the world's best active light-heavyweight by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board and BoxRec, and third by The [[Ring Magazine]].\n\n[[Kyrgyzstan's national basketball team]] had its best performance at the official [[1995 Asian Basketball Championship]] where the team surprisingly finished ahead of favorites such as [[Iran national basketball team|Iran]], [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] and [[Jordan national basketball team|Jordan]].\n\n===Horse riding===\nThe traditional national sports reflect the importance of [[horse riding]] in Kyrgyz culture.\n\nVery popular, as in all of Central Asia, is ''[[Buzkashi|Ulak Tartysh]]'', a [[team sports|team game]] resembling a cross between [[polo]] and [[rugby football|rugby]] in which two teams of riders wrestle for possession of the headless carcass of a goat, which they attempt to deliver across the opposition's goal line, or into the opposition's goal: a big tub or a circle marked on the ground.\n\nOther popular games on horseback include:\n* ''At Chabysh'' \u2013 a long-distance horse race, sometimes over a distance of more than 50&nbsp;km\n* ''Jumby Atmai'' \u2013 a large bar of precious metal (the \"jumby\") is tied to a pole by a thread and contestants attempt to break the thread by shooting at it, while at a gallop\n* ''[[Kyz Kuumai]]'' \u2013 a man chases a girl in order to win a kiss from her, while she gallops away; if he is not successful she may in turn chase him and attempt to beat him with her \"kamchi\" (horsewhip)\n* ''Oodarysh'' \u2013 two contestants wrestle on horseback, each attempting to be the first to throw the other from his horse\n* ''Tyin Emmei'' \u2013 picking up a coin from the ground at full gallop\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Kyrgyzstan}}\n[[File:Aucacampus.jpg|thumb|[[American University of Central Asia]]]]\n\nThe school system in Kyrgyzstan includes primary (grades 1 to 4, some schools have optional 0 grade), secondary (grades 5 to 9) and high (grades 10 to 11) divisions within one school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/cntrystd.kz|title=Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan : country studies|last=Curtis|first=Glenn E.|date=1997|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress, Federal Research Division|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070316011121/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/kztoc.html|archive-date=16 March 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref> Children are usually accepted to primary schools at the age of 6 or 7. It is required that every child finishes 9 grades of school and receives a certificate of completion. Grades 10\u201311 are optional, but it is necessary to complete them to graduate and receive a state-accredited school diploma. To graduate, a student must complete the 11-year school course and pass 4 mandatory state exams in writing, maths, history and a foreign language.\n\nThere are 77 public schools in Bishkek (capital city) and more than 200 in the rest of the country. There are 55 higher educational institutions and universities in Kyrgyzstan, out of which 37 are state institutions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn September 2016, the [[University of Central Asia]] was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucentralasia.org |title=University of Central Asia \u2013 University of Central Asia |publisher=Ucentralasia.org |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:E8102-Bishkek-West-Bus-Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Bishkek West Bus Terminal]]\n{{Main|Transport in Kyrgyzstan}}\nTransport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country's alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.\n\nAdditional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. [[Horse]]s are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan's road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported [[fuel]].\n\n===Airports===\nAt the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The [[Kyrgyzstan Air Company]] provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.\n* [[Manas International Airport]] near [[Bishkek]] is the main international airport, with services to Moscow, [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], [[Urumqi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Baku]], and [[Dubai]].\n* [[Osh Airport]] is the main air terminal in the south of the country, with daily connections to Bishkek, and services to Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Almaty and more international places.\n* [[Jalal-Abad Airport]] is linked to Bishkek by daily flights. The national flag carrier, Kyrgyzstan, operates flights on [[BAe-146]] aircraft. During the summer months, a weekly flight links Jalal-Abad with the Issyk-Kul Region.\n* Other facilities built during the Soviet era are either closed down, used only occasionally or restricted to military use (e.g., [[Kant Air Base]] near Bishkek, which is used by the [[Russian Air Force]]).\n\n===Banned airline status===\nKyrgyzstan appears on the European Union's [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union|list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines]]. This means that no airline which is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards which fail to meet European regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:102:0003:0016:EN:PDF |title=List of banned European Union air carriers |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> No EU airline has flights to Kyrgyzstan (as of 2020). Travel between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan includes changing aircraft, most often in Moscow or Istanbul.\n\n===Railways===\nThe [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Ferghana valley]] in the south were endpoints of the [[Soviet Union]]'s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about {{convert|370|km|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1520|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], and the cities of Russia.\n\nThere are vague plans about extending rail lines from [[Balykchy]] in the north and/or from [[Osh]] in the south into China, but the cost of construction would be enormous.\n\n====Rail links with adjacent countries====\n* [[Transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Bishkek]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Osh]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] \u2013 no \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|China]] \u2013 no \u2013 [[Break of gauge]] 1524&nbsp;mm/1435&nbsp;mm\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Osh 03-2016 img07 Gapar Aitiev Street.jpg|thumb|Street scene in [[Osh]].]]\nWith support from the [[Asian Development Bank]], a major road linking the north and southwest from [[Bishkek]] to [[Osh]] has recently been completed. This considerably eases communication between the two major population centres of the country\u2014the [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Fergana Valley]] in the South.

The firm found that the demand for Starbucks coffee exceeded the supply of [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] coffee available, and that Starbucks made efforts to purchase Fair Trade coffee, when available. Additionally, it was found that Starbucks paid premium prices for Ethiopian coffee at the time, prices higher than [[market value]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The analysis further criticized not Oxfam or Starbucks, but the Fair Trade brand specifically, stating it as more of a \"[[Quick Fix Mentality|quick fix]]\" to ease consumer guilt. While the firm acknowledged that the Fair Trade cause is noble, it was, however, lacking when pertaining aspects of regulation and [[Chain of custody|supply-chain custody]]. The analysis further found that the Fair Trade brand comes with many miscellaneous fees, such as certification, inspections, and marketing, stating less of the money from the sale of Fair Trade makes its way to the farmers producing the product.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSFK Inc. concluded that given the [[socio-political]] uncertainties of certain developing countries, external agreements within the government of such countries potentially opens the doors for corruption when farmer cooperatives are excluded from negotiation on their own behalf. The firm recommended that the coffee farmers produce directly for Starbucks, but non-exclusively, through a local subsidiary established by the brand. Such an agreement would allow Starbucks to fulfill its [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] goals, while ensuring Ethiopian specialty brands are recognized, and farmers are not subject to profit cuts from erroneous fees related to regulatory and bureaucratic procedures.<ref name=\":1\" /> The solution was criticized by opposition, stating such a solution would provide Starbucks a [[Monopoly|monopoly advantage]] on Ethiopian coffee, and did not fit the requirements for Fairtrade, specifically. While the analysis acknowledged the criticism, it also stated that farmers were still able to export any part of their crop through the traditional channels, and that while the solution did not meet the specific requirements of Fairtrade, it did align with its ultimate goal: protecting farmers.<ref name=\":1\" /> In May 2007, both Starbucks and the government of Ethiopia signed a licensing, distribution, and marketing agreement, recognizing the importance and integrity of Ethiopia's specialty coffee names.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/03/globalisation.money|title=Starbucks strikes deal with Ethiopia|last=Seager|first=Ashley|date=2007-05-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> These initiatives allow farmer cooperatives to earn more from its coffee brands, and enable poor growers to capture a greater share of the retail price.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Cups==\n===\"War On Christmas\"===\n{{main|Christmas controversy#2010s}}\nIn November 2015, Starbucks introduced solid red seasonal cups, unlike previous seasonal iterations that were decorated with winter or Christmas-oriented imagery (such as reindeer and ornaments), but no overtly religious symbols.

Additionally, it was found that Starbucks paid premium prices for Ethiopian coffee at the time, prices higher than [[market value]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The analysis further criticized not Oxfam or Starbucks, but the Fair Trade brand specifically, stating it as more of a \"[[Quick Fix Mentality|quick fix]]\" to ease consumer guilt. While the firm acknowledged that the Fair Trade cause is noble, it was, however, lacking when pertaining aspects of regulation and [[Chain of custody|supply-chain custody]]. The analysis further found that the Fair Trade brand comes with many miscellaneous fees, such as certification, inspections, and marketing, stating less of the money from the sale of Fair Trade makes its way to the farmers producing the product.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSFK Inc. concluded that given the [[socio-political]] uncertainties of certain developing countries, external agreements within the government of such countries potentially opens the doors for corruption when farmer cooperatives are excluded from negotiation on their own behalf.

The area was historically the core of the [[County of Tyrol]], part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], from its formation in the 12th century until 1919. In 1919, following [[World War I]] and [[dissolution of Austria-Hungary]], it was divided into two modern administrative parts through the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]:\n* State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]; formed through the merger of [[North Tyrol|North]] and [[East Tyrol]], as part of [[Austria]]\n* Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]]; at that time still with [[Souramont]] ([[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]]) and the municipalities [[Valvestino]], [[Magasa, Lombardy|Magasa]] and [[Pedemonte]], seized in 1918 by the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and thus since 1946 part of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]].\n\nWith the founding of the European region [[Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino Euroregion|Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] the area has its own legal entity since 2011 in the form of a [[European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAccording to {{ill|Egon K\u00fchebacher|de}}, the name ''Tyrol'' derives from a root word meaning ''terrain'' (i.e. area, ground or soil; compare {{lang-la|terra}} and [[Old Irish]]: ''tir''); first from the village of [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], and its [[Tyrol Castle|castle]]; from which the [[County of Tyrol]] grew.<ref>{{cite book |first=Egon |last=K\u00fchebacher |title=Die Ortsnamen S\u00fcdtirols und ihre Geschichte.

The region consists of the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the Province of [[South Tyrol]] and the [[Trentino|Province of Trento]]. In addition to the region belong the municipalities [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]], [[Colle Santa Lucia]] and [[Pedemonte]] from the Region of [[Veneto]] and [[Valvestino]] and [[Magasa, Lombardy|Magasa]] from the Region of [[Lombardy]]. The largest cities in Tyrol are [[Innsbruck]], [[Trento]] and [[Bolzano]].\n\nThe whole region of Tyrol is located in the [[Alps]]. Tyrol is bordered to the north by the state of [[Bavaria]] and to the east by the states of [[Carinthia]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]]. West of Tyrol lies the state of [[Vorarlberg]] and the canton of [[Grisons]]. On the southern side of Tyrol, the land is bordered by the regions of [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]].\n\nImportant rivers in Tyrol are the [[Adige]], [[Inn (river)|Inn]] and [[Drau]]. The region is characterized by many valleys. Some of these valleys are still difficult to reach today. The most important valleys are the [[Inn Valley]] and [[Adige Valley]]. A large part of the population lives in these two valleys and also the five largest cities of Tyrol ([[Innsbruck]], [[Bolzano]], [[Trento]], [[Merano]] and [[Rovereto]]) lie in these valleys. For centuries, the region has been known for transit trade. The most important trade route across the Alps, namely the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner Route]], traverses the whole of Tyrol and is regarded as a connecting link between the Italian and [[German speaking area|German]] speaking areas.\n\n===Mountains===\n[[File:Ortler Reschensee.JPG|right|200px|thumb|left summit: the [[Gran Zebr\u00f9]], right summit: the [[Ortler]]; seen from [[Lake Reschen]]]]\nAs the Tyrolean region is located in the [[Alps]], the landscape is heavily influenced by the mountains.

These language groups are mostly located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region and are thus promoted and protected by the region.\nThe Ladin language is also spoken outside the region in [[Souramont]] ([[Province of Belluno]]). Ladin is considered a [[Rhaeto-Romance language]].\nThe [[Cimbrian language]] is also used in various linguistic islands ([[Sette Comuni]]) outside the region of Trentino-South Tyrol. The Cimbrian language is considered an upper-Bavarian dialect.\n\n====Dialects====\nIn the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the German language is used by a large majority. As in many other regions in German-speaking countries, Tyrol also has its own German-language dialect. The Tyrolean dialect comes from the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialect.\nIn [[South Tyrol]], the Tyrolean dialect was mixed with a few individual Italian words. Due to the difficult accessibility of the valleys in earlier years, many other valleys developed a slightly differentiated dialect compared to the Tyrolean. The Italian language group in South Tyrol mostly uses the Italian standard language and does not speak any dialect.\nThe Ladin language also has no uniform language, so every valley also has a slight difference in [[Ladinia]].\nThe majority in [[Trentino]] speaks its own Italian dialect. This dialect has slightly Venetian features, mixed with words from the German-Bavarian dialect.\n\n==Heraldry==\n: ''See {{ill|Coat of arms of Tyrol|de|Tiroler Wappen}}''\n\nAlthough the details of the arms of Tyrol have changed over the centuries, one feature has remained more-or-less constant: ''[[argent]]'', an [[Eagle (heraldry)#Eagle displayed|eagle displayed]] ''[[gules]]'', armed (and sometimes crowned) ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |first=A.

They date from the [[Palaeolithic]], about 28,000-27,000 [[years BP|BP]]. The same cave has also yielded evidence of human occupation during the [[Bronze Age]] (very roughly, 4000-3000 BP (2000\u20131000 BC)).\n\nIn 1991, the mummified remains of a man who had died around 3300-3100 BC were discovered in a glacier in the [[\u00d6tztal Alps]], in Tyrol. Researchers have called him [[\u00d6tzi]] (and also other names, including \"The Iceman\"). He lived during the [[Chalcolithic]] or Copper Age, after man had learned how to exploit copper but before man had learned how to make bronze. His body and belongings were very well-preserved, and have been subjected to detailed scientific study. They are preserved in the [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]], [[Bolzano]], South Tyrol, Italy.\n\nThere is evidence that Tyrol was a centre for copper mining in the 4th millennium BC; for example, at [[Brixlegg]]. There is also evidence of the [[Urnfield culture]] (roughly 1300\u2013750 BC).\n\nEvidence of the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] (roughly 450\u2013100 BC, during the [[Iron Age]]) has also been found; as has evidence of the [[Fritzens-Sanzeno culture]] from about the same period. Towards the end of that time, Tyrol began to be noted in Roman written records. The inhabitants may have been [[Illyrians]], in the process of being displaced by [[Celts]] (perhaps themselves displaced from [[Noricum]] by [[Slavs]]). There are also indications that [[Adriatic Veneti]] may have been present in the south of the region. The Romans called them [[Rhaetians]]; although it is not clear whether that then meant a specific tribe or confederation of tribes, or was a broader term for the inhabitants of the area. They made wine barrels (an idea which the Romans took from them), and had their own alphabet.\n\n===Roman times===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn 15 BC, Tyrol was conquered by Roman forces commanded by [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. The Romans established [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] as [[Roman province|province]]s of the [[Roman Empire]]. Raetia included Vinschgau, Burggrafenamt, Eisacktal, Wipptal, Oberinntal and parts of the Unterinntal. Noricum included Pustertal, Defereggen and parts of the Unterinntal to the right of the Ziller and the Inn. [[Bolzano]] and the extreme south of Tyrol belonged to the province of [[Triveneto|Venetia et Histria]].\n\nThe inhabitants adopted the Latin Language called vulgar Latin or the everyday spoken version vs. the standardized written formal form, and combined it with their own languages. The result was [[Romansh language|Romansh]], which is still spoken today and is one of the official languages of Switzerland.\n\nThe Romans constructed [[Roman roads|metalled roads]] guarded by [[Roman fort|fort]]s through Tyrol to connect the Italian peninsula and the lands beyond; notably the [[Via Claudia Augusta]] and the {{ill|Via Raetia|de}}. The Romans did not seem to find Tyrol an attractive area in which to build new towns, because there are few of them. One town they did build was [[Aguntum]], near modern [[Lienz]].\n\nIn late antiquity (from AD 476), Tyrol belonged to the [[Ostrogoths]], and it was included in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. In 534, the Ostrogoths lost Merrano, Val Venosta and Passer to the [[Franks]]. The Ostrogothic Kingdom collapsed in 553, after being overrun by [[Bajuvarians]] from the north and [[Lombards]] from the south. The Lombards established the [[Duchy of Tridentum]] (or, Trent; roughly corresponding to modern [[Trentino]]) in south Tyrol. [[Slavic people]]s, who had recently taken [[Carinthia]] from the Bajuvarians, settled in east Tyrol.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n{{main|County of Tyrol}}\nMost of Tyrol came under the control of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] (created {{circa|555}}). The southern parts, including Bolzano, [[Salorno]], and the right bank of the [[Adige]] (including [[Eppan an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Eppan]] and [[Kaltern an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Kaltern]]) remained under the Lombards. Tyrol was Christianised through the bishoprics of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Brixen]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento|Triento]]. The frontier remained the same though [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] times. The area was subject to ''Stammensgerechte'' ([[Ancient Germanic law]]s), such as ''[[Lex Romana Curiensis]]'', ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'', ''[[Lex Baiuvariorum]]'' and ''[[Leges Langobardorum]]''.\n\n[[File:Am Schloss Tirol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tyrol Castle]] in [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], near [[Merano]].]]\nIn 1027, Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], in order to secure the important route through the [[Brenner Pass]], allotted the left bank of the Adige (from [[Lana, South Tyrol|Lana]] to [[Mezzocorona]]) to the Duchy of Bavaria. During the 12th century, the local nobility went further: they built [[Tyrol Castle]] in the modern ''[[comune]]'' of [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]] in South Tyrol, near modern [[Merano]]; and around 1140, established the [[County of Tyrol]] as a state within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Counts of Tyrol were at first ''[[Vogt]]'' (underlords) subject to the Bishoprics of Brixen and Triento; but they had other ideas. They expanded their holdings at those bishoprics' expense. They displaced competing nobles like the {{ill|House of Eppan|de|Eppan (Adelsgeschlecht)}}, and declared their independence from the Duchy of Bavaria; though not without dispute. In 1228, they conceded the {{ill|Saalforste|de}} to the [[House of Wittelsbach]], rulers of Bavaria; as a result, that area remains part of Bavaria to this day.\n\nIn 1253, rulership of the County passed by inheritance to the [[Meinhardiner|Meinhardiner family]]. In 1335, the last male heir to the Meinhardiner lands, [[Henry of Bohemia]], died. His daughter, [[Margaret, Countess of Tyrol|Margaret]], thereupon became Countess of Tyrol; but her title was in doubt because of different laws in different lands as to what a woman could or could not inherit. She navigated her way between the competing claims of the Houses of Wittelsbach, [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and [[Habsburg]] by, in 1342, marrying [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria|Louis of Wittelsbach]]. Louis died in 1361. Margaret died in 1369, and bequeathed Tyrol to [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf of Habsburg]]. The various dynastic squabbles were resolved that same year by the {{ill|Treaty of Sch\u00e4rding|de|Frieden von Sch\u00e4rding}}, under which (for suitable compensation) the Wittelsbachs agreed to relinquish their claims to Tyrol in favour of the Habsburgs.\n\nWhen the Habsburgs took control of Tyrol, it had roughly its modern size. However, the [[Unterinntal]] downstream from [[Schwaz]] still belonged to Bavaria; the [[Zillertal]] and [[Brixental]] to [[Salzburg]]; [[Brixen]] and the [[Pustertal]] were episcopal territories, or part of the [[County of Gorizia]]. On the other hand, the [[Montafon]] and the [[Unterengadin]] were Tyrolean.\n\nTyrol was of great strategic importance to the Habsburgs. It controlled several important Alpine passes. It connected their landholdings in [[Further Austria]]. In 1406, as the Habsburg lands were split up by inheritance, Tyrol once again became a separate entity (a ''[[Landstand]]''), in which the greater landowners had the right to be consulted (''Mitspracherecht''). During a confusing succession of events, in 1420 [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]] moved the capital of Tyrol from [[Meran]] to [[Innsbruck]], and Meran lost its earlier importance.\n\n==Politics==\n===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===\n{{main|Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino}}\n[[File:Dreier Landtag.jpg|thumb|right|Dreier-Landtag]]\nThe [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] was founded in 1998. The aim is to strengthen cooperation between the separated countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/willkommen.asp|title=Willkommen|publisher=Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref> In several areas, such as mobility, agriculture, education and culture will be tried to promote exchange and to raise the awareness of the cultural and historical heritage of the region of Tyrol in the minds of the population. Cross-border projects will be initiated to improve the relationship between the different language groups.\nTo represent common ideas and values in Europe, the Euroregion has a joint office in [[Brussels]] since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europaregion.info/de/europa.asp|title=Europ\u00e4ische Integration und Euregio|publisher=Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref> The headquarters of the office is in [[Bolzano]]. Joint decisions are taken by organized three diet (in German: ''Dreier-Landtag''), which have been held since 1991 mostly every two to three years with the [[Landtag|state Diets]] of Trento (provincial council of Trentino), [[Landtag of South Tyrol|Bolzano]] (provincial council of South Tyrol) and Innsbruck (state council of Tyrol (State)). In 2011, the region was institutionalized and since then has its own legal entity.\n\n===Political Parties===\nPolitical parties in the Italian part of Tyrol (provinces of Bolzano and Trento) include:\n* [[Partito Democratico]] (PD)\n* [[S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei]] (SVP)\n* [[Movimento 5 Stelle|Movimento Cinque Stelle]] (M5S)\n* [[Lega Nord]] (LN)\n* [[Greens (South Tyrol)|Greens]]\n* [[South Tyrolean Freedom]]\n* [[Die Freiheitlichen]]\n* [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]] (PATT)\n\nThe Austrian part of Tyrol shares the Austrian party system:\n* [[Tiroler Volkspartei]]; organization of the [[\u00d6VP]] in the state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], which has dominated local politics since 1945\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6)\n* [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6)\n* [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative]]\n* [[NEOS - The New Austria and Liberal Forum|NEOS]]\n\nThe multiplicity of parties is due to the fact that Tyrol lies in two different nation states and thus are politically independent of each other. Another reason for the large number of parties is the great independence of the two Provinces of [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]] and [[Trentino|Trento]]. By the second statute of autonomy in 1972, the province of Bolzano acquired much of the region's competences and since then has been mostly independent of the province of Trento. The second autonomy statute enabled the linguistic minorities to be better protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/politik-recht-aussenbeziehungen/autonomie/autonomiestatut.asp|title=Das Autonomiestatut|publisher=Province of South Tyrol|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref>\nThe [[regional council of Trentino-South Tyrol]], which consists of the two provincial councils of Bolzano and Trento, has less influence and competences. Thus, many parties determine their focus within the provinces. Other parties in [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], especially in South Tyrol, were founded on the example of Austrian parties and have many similarities with the [[List of political parties in Austria|parties in Austria]].\n\n==Economy==\nIn the economic sector statistics are shown, which are based largely on numbers and data of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]]. It lacks individual communities that are outside the Euroregion. As there are no 10,000 inhabitants living in these communities, the statistics hardly distort the territory of Tyrol and the remaining 1.8 million inhabitants.\n\nTyrol had a total GDP of 67.6 billion euros in 2014. Divided into individual countries, the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] generated 28.8 billion euros, the Province of [[South Tyrol]] 20.6 billion euros and the Province of [[Trentino]] 18.2 billion euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/zahlen-europaregion.asp|title=ZAHLEN ZUR EUROPAREGION|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-S\u00fcdtirol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-02-03}}</ref> In GDP per capita (2015), that means 39,300 euros/capita in the State of Tyrol, 42,400 euros/capita in South Tyrol and 35,500 euros/capita in Trentino.

The many small and medium-sized farms have shaped the landscape and culture in Tyrol for many centuries. In order to be competitive with larger farms outside Tyrol, there is a strong [[cooperative]] system in Tyrol.\nSouth of Tyrol, in the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], the cultivation of apples and wine plays an important role. So every tenth apple in Europe comes from [[South Tyrol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idm-suedtirol.com/de/ueber-suedtirol/1-jeder-10-europaeische-apfel-kommt-aus-suedtirol.html|title=Jeder 10.

Horses also play an increasingly important role in livestock, for equestrian sports and farm holidays. The [[Haflinger]] horses are known in the Tyrolean region and originate from [[Hafling]], near [[Merano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tt.com/lebensart/freizeit/13610447-91/pferde-in-tirol-das-gl\u00fcck-der-erde-steht-auf-vier-beinen.csp|title=Pferde in Tirol:Das Gl\u00fcck der Erde steht auf vier Beinen|publisher=Tiroler Tageszeitung|accessdate=2018-02-03}}</ref>\n\n===Secondary sector===\nThe first industrialization reached Tyrol late in the 19th century. Most of these were small businesses that were important only in the local area. A second wave of industrialization took place at the beginning of the 20th century. Particularly affected at that time was the city of [[Bolzano]] with the [[Italianization]] policy under Fascism in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hk-cciaa.bz.it/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Scuola_economia/20181_materiale_didattico2014_ECONOMIC_HISTORY_de.pdf|title=ECONOMIC HISTORY|publisher=Handelskammer Bozen|accessdate=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, approximately 10% of the workplaces in all parts of the country were active in the manufacturing sector.

The craft still plays a special role throughout the region. A large part of these craft businesses are still partially small-structured and family businesses. From an economic point of view, the energy sector is important in the secondary sector. Much of the electricity produced is generated by [[hydropower]].\n\n===Tertiary sector===\n[[File:Riva del Garda , Panorama - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|A known city for tourism: [[Riva del Garda]] on [[Lake Garda]]]]\nThe most important sector in Tyrol is the tertiary sector. Especially tourism has a special position in this region. Due to the connection of the areas by the railway in the 19th century, many villages in Tyrol developed into popular tourism locations. The construction of the Brenner motorway in the 1960s gave region in the 20th century a renewed upswing in the tourism branch. Today, [[Merano]], [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]] or [[Riva del Garda]] are among the most important tourism destinations in the Alpine region.

Among other things, the [[Bolzano#Exhibition Bolzano|Exhibition of Bolzano]] has been a meeting point for Italian and German economy already for centuries. As a transit route country, more than 2.25 million trucks (2017) drove over the [[Brenner Pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stol.it/Artikel/Wirtschaft/Wirtschaft/Transit-Mehr-als-2-25-Millionen-Lkw-fuhren-2017-ueber-den-Brenner|title=Transit: Mehr als 2,25 Millionen Lkw fuhren 2017 \u00fcber den Brenner|publisher=stol.it|accessdate=2018-02-04}}</ref> This means that two times more trucks travel on the Brenner Route than in all four Alpine crossing roads in Switzerland together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tirol.orf.at/news/stories/2682236/|title= Mehr Transit-Lkws \u00fcber den Brenner als in Schweiz|publisher=tirol.orf.at|accessdate=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nTyrol is known as a transit route. The most important route between northern and southern Europe, the Brenner route, traverses the entire region. At 1370 m above the Adriatic, the [[Brenner Pass]] is the lowest pass crossing of the [[main chain of the Alps]].\nDue to the linguistic diversity and the climatic transition from [[temperate climate]] ([[alpine climate]]) to [[mediterranean climate]], the area is regarded as a bridge between the Italian and German speaking countries.\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:Flughafen Innsbruck - 12-06-05 by ralfr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Innsbruck Airport]]]]\nThe most important airport in Tyrol is [[Innsbruck Airport]]. With over one million passengers, it is the third largest airport in Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flugladen.at/flughafen/innsbruck|title=Flughafen Innsbruck|publisher=flugladen.at|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref>  Other airports in the region are in [[Bolzano Airport|Bolzano]] and [[Trento Airport|Trento]]. These do not offer regular scheduled flights and the [[Bolzano Airport]] currently offers charter flights. There are other small airfields in [[Toblach]], [[Kufstein]], [[St. Johann in Tirol]], [[Reutte]] and [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]]. The airfield in Cortina was closed in 1976 due to a crash.\n\n===Road transport===\nHighways in Tyrol are the Brenner motorway and the Inntal motorway. The Brenner motorway runs from [[Innsbruck]] (in Austria [[Brenner Autobahn|A13]]) to Modena (in Italy [[Autostrada A22 (Italy)|A22]]). Together with the Inntal motorway from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Kufstein]] is the part of the [[European route E45]]. The dual carriageway from [[Merano]] to [[Bolzano]] (MeBo) ends in Bolzano South in the Brenner motorway. Important road section in [[Trentino]], next to the Brenner motorway, is the SS 47 (Strada Statale 47), which connects via [[Sugana Valley]] [[Trento]] with [[Padova]]. A large part of this route is dual-lane and flows into the Brenner state road (SS 12).\nDue to the [[Alps]], there are many [[mountain pass]]es that connect valleys. The most important pass roads for transit trade are the [[Reschen Pass]] and [[Brenner Pass]]. Popular pass roads include the [[Stelvio Pass]], [[Arlberg Pass]], [[Karerpass|Karer Pass]], [[Mendel Pass]] and the [[Gardena Pass]]. The Provinces of [[Trentino|Trento]] and [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]] have been responsible for the preservation and management of the state roads in their provinces since 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/news/de/news.asp?news_action=4&news_article_id=590799|title=ANAS-Immobilien gehen an das Land \u00fcber \u2013 Vertrag nun unterzeichnet|publisher=Provinz Bozen|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Nuovo Treno Val Pusteria.JPG|thumb|left|Pustertal railway]]\nThe most important railway line in Tyrol is the Brenner Line via the [[Brenner Pass]]. The [[Brenner Railway]] was opened in 1867 and runs from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Verona]] via the cities of [[Bolzano]] and [[Trento]]. Together with the [[New Lower Inn Valley Railway|Lower Inn Valley Railway]] in [[North Tyrol]], this section of the route is part of the important European railway axis [[Berlin-Palermo railway axis|Berlin-Palermo]], which connects northern Europe with southern Europe across the Alps. With the construction of the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]] and its completion in 2027, transit traffic on the rail will be promoted and relocated. After completion, the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]], together with the [[Innsbruck bypass]], will be the longest railway tunnel in the world at 64&nbsp;km and will reduce the travel time between [[Bolzano]] and [[Innsbruck]] from 2 hours to 45 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tt.com/politik/landespolitik/13383174-91/tirol-und-s\u00fcdtirol-feierten-150-jahre-brennerbahn-mit-railjet.csp|title=Tirol und S\u00fcdtirol feierten 150 Jahre Brennerbahn mit Railjet|publisher=Tiroler Tageszeitung|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/neuer-brenner-tunnel-mit-tempo-250-durch-die-alpen-13671819.html|title=Mit Tempo 250 durch die Alpen|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n\nFurther important railway lines in Tyrol are the [[Arlberg railway]], [[Zillertal Railway|Zillertal railway]], [[Salzburg-Tyrol Railway|Salzburg-Tyrol railway]], [[Pustertal railway]] with continuation of the [[Drautal railway]], the [[railway line Bolzano-Merano]] and the continuation of the [[Vinschgau railway]], the [[Trento\u2013Mal\u00e8\u2013Mezzana railway]] and the [[Trento\u2013Venice railway|Valsugana railway]], which leads from [[Trento]] to [[Venice]] over the [[Sugana Valley]].

The aim is to shift traffic through the Alps to sustainable means of transport, thus protecting the Alpine environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/mobilitaet-verkehr.asp|title=MOBILIT\u00c4T UND VERKEHR|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-S\u00fcdtirol-Trentino}}</ref>\n\n===Local public transport===\nMany villages and communities are difficult to reach because of the large differences in altitude, so the region sets much on [[ropeway]] concepts. Although most of the [[Aerial lift|cable cars]] are located in ski resorts, they are also used for the local public transport. Known cable cars in Tyrol are the [[Ritten cable car]] in [[Bolzano]], the [[Sardagna cable car]] in [[Trento]] and the [[Nordkette Cable Car|Nordkette cable car]] in [[Innsbruck]]. Also [[funicular]] railways are being built to cope with the differences in altitude more quickly. Famous funiculars are among others the [[Hungerburgbahn]] in [[Innsbruck]] and the [[Mendel funicular]] in [[Kaltern]].\n\nLocal public transport is usually offered with intercity buses or city buses. The city of [[Innsbruck Tramway|Innsbruck]] has its own tram network. Another [[Rittnerbahn|tram]] is located in [[Ritten]]. The cities of [[Bolzano Tramway|Bolzano]], [[Meran Tramway|Merano]] and [[Trento]] formerly had their own tram network, but these were displaced and replaced by the city buses and private transport in the 50s and 60s.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Tyrolean culture has been cultivated for several centuries and passed on to future generations. The state border between South and North Tyrol is more a political border and is considered less as a cultural border. Many traditions are cultivated throughout the Tyrolean region and show little differences. In all cultural areas such as food, dress or customs there are many similarities. Nevertheless, the individual language groups, especially the minority languages, try to maintain and promote their own linguistic identity.\n\n=== Tyrolean cuisine ===\n[[File:S\u00fcdtiroler Speck g.g.A. aufgeschnitten.jpg|thumb|200px|left|South [[Tyrolean Speck]]]]\nThe [[Austrian cuisine#Tyrol|Tyrolean cuisine]] has similarities with the [[Austrian cuisine]] and is characterized by its alpine influence. Also the historical influence of the former [[K.U.K. Monarchy]] can be found in the Tyrolean dishes. These include dishes such as [[goulash]], [[Kaiserschmarrn]] and [[apple strudel]] which are consumed in large parts of the [[Danube monarchy]] and today still in Tyrol. Since the region is still relatively strong agricultural and peasant today, also many peasant dishes are offered on the farms. [[Schlutzkrapfen]], [[Kn\u00f6del|boiled dumplings]] or cold cuts with [[Tyrolean Speck|bacon (in German: ''Speck'')]] or [[Tyrolean_grey_cheese|grey cheese]] is eaten on the farms.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tirol.at/reisefuehrer/kultur-leben/kulinarik|title=Essen und trinken in Tirol|publisher=Tirol Marketing|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n\nThe Tyrolean dishes show only slight differences throughout Tyrol. Due to the Mediterranean conditions in the southern part of Tyrol, a lot of wine is grown and is therefore also an important part of the Tyrolean dish, especially in [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]]. Famous wines from this area are the [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]], [[Pinot Blanc]], [[Pinot Grigio]] and [[Chardonnay]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.suedtirolwein.com/de/suedtirol-wein.html|title=S\u00fcdtirol Wein|publisher=S\u00fcdtirol Wein|accessdate=2018-01-21}}</ref> Furthermore, a lot of apples are grown in the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]]. In this region also a food culture is cultivated with a mixture of Italian and Tyrolean specialties.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.suedtirol.info/de/erleben/essen-trinken|title=Essen und trinken in S\u00fcdtirol|publisher=IDM S\u00fcdtirol|accessdate=2018-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.trentino.com/de/freizeit-aktiv/essen-trinken/|title=Essen und trinken|publisher=trentino.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Tyrolean Rifles ===\n[[File:Sch\u00fctzenkompaniecastelam.jpg|thumb|right|Trentino Rifle Company in front of [[Castle of Castellano]]]]\nThe Tyrolean Rifles were a militia organised in case of an attack on [[Crown land (Austria)|crown land]], which required Tyrol to defend its territory. The militia consisted mostly of citizens and peasants who were responsible only for the defence of their own land and were not obliged to go to war on behalf of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. They were authorised by an order signed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] in 1511 that remained valid until 1918. The Tyrolean Rifles became known in [[Tyrolean Rebellion|1809]] when Tyrolese peasants rose up and fought against the French-Bavarian occupation under [[Napoleon]]. The ensuing four [[Battles of Bergisel]] were led by [[Andreas Hofer]]. The Rifles were also used in [[World War I]] in 1915 on the [[Dolomite front]].\nAfter the separation of Tyrol and the downfall of the monarchy, the companies also lost their task of defending their country. Nevertheless, they remained as a non-governmental organization.\nToday, the Rifles are responsible as an organization for the preservation of the Tyrolean culture and are always present at important political events in Tyrol.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://schuetzen.com/organisation/ssb/ueber-uns/|title=\u00dcber uns|publisher=S\u00fcdtiroler Sch\u00fctzenbund|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n\n===Customs===\nMany Tyrolean customs were created centuries ago and are passed on by the population for the next generations. Typical in the Alpine region are the many individual customs in the valleys. Due to the seclusion of the valleys, the locals developed their own customs. Many customs have been created by legends and narratives, others by the close connection to the church. There are also traditions that are cultivated everywhere in the Tyrolean region and do not differ from other valleys and villages. These customs give local people an identity and thus feel the community more connected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tirol.at/reisefuehrer/kultur-leben/brauchtum|title=Brauchtum|publisher=Tirol Marketing|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Krampus2.jpg|[[Krampus]] in [[Toblach]].

Many athletes, such as [[Gustav Thoeni]], [[Benjamin Raich]], [[Carolina Kostner]], [[Gregor Schlierenzauer]], [[Toni Sailer]] and [[Armin Zoeggeler]] have already won overall World Cups and medals at World Championships and Olympic Games.\nEven in summer sports, several athletes from Tyrol were and still are among the best in the world. In water jumping [[Tania Cagnotto]] and [[Klaus Dibiasi]] won several medals. In cycling, [[Francesco Moser]] won the [[Giro d'Italia]]. [[Andreas Seppi]] played against the best tennis players in the world for many years. In [[bouldering]] [[Anna St\u00f6hr]] was one of the best in the world.\nMany Tyrolean mountaineers such as [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Hans Kammerlander]] influenced the [[alpinism]].\n\n===Football===\nThe [[FC Wacker Innsbruck (2002)|FC Wacker Innsbruck]] is one of the most traditional and successful clubs in Austria. Since the club was founded in 1915 and several name changes, the football club has won ten times the Austrian Championship and seven times the Austrian Cup. In 1987, it reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA CUP]]. In 1970, the team defeated Real Madrid in Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fc-wacker-innsbruck.at/2-uncategorised/1400-erfolge.html|title=Erfolge|publisher=FC Wacker Innsbruck|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> Currently (2018) Wacker Innsbruck plays in the \"[[Austrian Football First League|Erste Liga]]\" (second highest category of Austria).\n\nIn the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], the [[FC S\u00fcdtirol]] and [[A.C. Trento S.C.S.D.|AC Trento]] are the two most important clubs. Both teams participated in the Italian [[Serie C]] (third highest league in Italy) for several seasons. The AC Trento has a long history until 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.actrento.com/storia/|title=storia|publisher=AC Trento|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> FC S\u00fcdtirol was founded in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fc-suedtirol.com/de/fc-s\u00fcdtirol/geschichte/4-0.html|title=Geschichte|publisher=FC S\u00fcdtirol|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> AC Trento are currently (2018) playing in the Italian [[Serie D]] (fourth highest league in Italy) and FC S\u00fcdtirol in [[Serie C]].

Important clubs are the [[HC Bolzano]] and the [[HC Innsbruck]]. Both teams play in the [[EBEL]]. The HC Innsbruck, formerly [[EV Innsbruck]], won the Austrian championship seven times. With 19 won Italian championships, the HC Bolzano is the record champion in Italy. The club celebrated the biggest international successes by winning the [[Alpenliga]], the [[EBEL]] and the [[Six Nations Tournament (ice hockey)|Six Nations Tournament]]  with [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hcb.net/de/verein/hall-of-fame-2/|title=Hall of fame|publisher=HC Bozen|accessdate=2018-01-28}}</ref> The Italian ice hockey league consists mostly of South Tyrolean teams. 5 of the 8 Italian teams in the [[Alps Hockey League]] come from South Tyrol ([[HC Neumarkt-Egna]], [[HC Pustertal]], [[Ritten Sport]], [[HC Gardena]] and [[WSV Sterzing Broncos]]). In this league three more Tyrolean teams play ([[SG Cortina]], [[HC Fassa]] and [[EC Kitzb\u00fchel]]).\n\nIn 2005, the [[2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] was held in [[Innsbruck]] and Vienna.

The area was historically the core of the [[County of Tyrol]], part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], from its formation in the 12th century until 1919. In 1919, following [[World War I]] and [[dissolution of Austria-Hungary]], it was divided into two modern administrative parts through the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]:\n* State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]; formed through the merger of [[North Tyrol|North]] and [[East Tyrol]], as part of [[Austria]]\n* Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]]; at that time still with [[Souramont]] ([[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]]) and the municipalities [[Valvestino]], [[Magasa, Lombardy|Magasa]] and [[Pedemonte]], seized in 1918 by the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and thus since 1946 part of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]].\n\nWith the founding of the European region [[Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino Euroregion|Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] the area has its own legal entity since 2011 in the form of a [[European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAccording to {{ill|Egon K\u00fchebacher|de}}, the name ''Tyrol'' derives from a root word meaning ''terrain'' (i.e. area, ground or soil; compare {{lang-la|terra}} and [[Old Irish]]: ''tir''); first from the village of [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], and its [[Tyrol Castle|castle]]; from which the [[County of Tyrol]] grew.<ref>{{cite book |first=Egon |last=K\u00fchebacher |title=Die Ortsnamen S\u00fcdtirols und ihre Geschichte.

The region consists of the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the Province of [[South Tyrol]] and the [[Trentino|Province of Trento]]. In addition to the region belong the municipalities [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]], [[Colle Santa Lucia]] and [[Pedemonte]] from the Region of [[Veneto]] and [[Valvestino]] and [[Magasa, Lombardy|Magasa]] from the Region of [[Lombardy]]. The largest cities in Tyrol are [[Innsbruck]], [[Trento]] and [[Bolzano]].\n\nThe whole region of Tyrol is located in the [[Alps]]. Tyrol is bordered to the north by the state of [[Bavaria]] and to the east by the states of [[Carinthia]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]]. West of Tyrol lies the state of [[Vorarlberg]] and the canton of [[Grisons]]. On the southern side of Tyrol, the land is bordered by the regions of [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]].\n\nImportant rivers in Tyrol are the [[Adige]], [[Inn (river)|Inn]] and [[Drau]]. The region is characterized by many valleys. Some of these valleys are still difficult to reach today. The most important valleys are the [[Inn Valley]] and [[Adige Valley]]. A large part of the population lives in these two valleys and also the five largest cities of Tyrol ([[Innsbruck]], [[Bolzano]], [[Trento]], [[Merano]] and [[Rovereto]]) lie in these valleys. For centuries, the region has been known for transit trade. The most important trade route across the Alps, namely the [[Brenner Pass|Brenner Route]], traverses the whole of Tyrol and is regarded as a connecting link between the Italian and [[German speaking area|German]] speaking areas.\n\n===Mountains===\n[[File:Ortler Reschensee.JPG|right|200px|thumb|left summit: the [[Gran Zebr\u00f9]], right summit: the [[Ortler]]; seen from [[Lake Reschen]]]]\nAs the Tyrolean region is located in the [[Alps]], the landscape is heavily influenced by the mountains.

In addition to the majority languages such as German and Italian, languages such as [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] and [[M\u00f3cheno language|M\u00f3cheno]] are also spoken. The last three languages are recognized as minority languages. These language groups are mostly located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region and are thus promoted and protected by the region.\nThe Ladin language is also spoken outside the region in [[Souramont]] ([[Province of Belluno]]). Ladin is considered a [[Rhaeto-Romance language]].\nThe [[Cimbrian language]] is also used in various linguistic islands ([[Sette Comuni]]) outside the region of Trentino-South Tyrol. The Cimbrian language is considered an upper-Bavarian dialect.\n\n====Dialects====\nIn the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the German language is used by a large majority. As in many other regions in German-speaking countries, Tyrol also has its own German-language dialect. The Tyrolean dialect comes from the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialect.\nIn [[South Tyrol]], the Tyrolean dialect was mixed with a few individual Italian words. Due to the difficult accessibility of the valleys in earlier years, many other valleys developed a slightly differentiated dialect compared to the Tyrolean. The Italian language group in South Tyrol mostly uses the Italian standard language and does not speak any dialect.\nThe Ladin language also has no uniform language, so every valley also has a slight difference in [[Ladinia]].\nThe majority in [[Trentino]] speaks its own Italian dialect. This dialect has slightly Venetian features, mixed with words from the German-Bavarian dialect.\n\n==Heraldry==\n: ''See {{ill|Coat of arms of Tyrol|de|Tiroler Wappen}}''\n\nAlthough the details of the arms of Tyrol have changed over the centuries, one feature has remained more-or-less constant: ''[[argent]]'', an [[Eagle (heraldry)#Eagle displayed|eagle displayed]] ''[[gules]]'', armed (and sometimes crowned) ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |first=A.

They date from the [[Palaeolithic]], about 28,000-27,000 [[years BP|BP]]. The same cave has also yielded evidence of human occupation during the [[Bronze Age]] (very roughly, 4000-3000 BP (2000\u20131000 BC)).\n\nIn 1991, the mummified remains of a man who had died around 3300-3100 BC were discovered in a glacier in the [[\u00d6tztal Alps]], in Tyrol. Researchers have called him [[\u00d6tzi]] (and also other names, including \"The Iceman\"). He lived during the [[Chalcolithic]] or Copper Age, after man had learned how to exploit copper but before man had learned how to make bronze. His body and belongings were very well-preserved, and have been subjected to detailed scientific study. They are preserved in the [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]], [[Bolzano]], South Tyrol, Italy.\n\nThere is evidence that Tyrol was a centre for copper mining in the 4th millennium BC; for example, at [[Brixlegg]]. There is also evidence of the [[Urnfield culture]] (roughly 1300\u2013750 BC).\n\nEvidence of the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] (roughly 450\u2013100 BC, during the [[Iron Age]]) has also been found; as has evidence of the [[Fritzens-Sanzeno culture]] from about the same period. Towards the end of that time, Tyrol began to be noted in Roman written records. The inhabitants may have been [[Illyrians]], in the process of being displaced by [[Celts]] (perhaps themselves displaced from [[Noricum]] by [[Slavs]]). There are also indications that [[Adriatic Veneti]] may have been present in the south of the region. The Romans called them [[Rhaetians]]; although it is not clear whether that then meant a specific tribe or confederation of tribes, or was a broader term for the inhabitants of the area. They made wine barrels (an idea which the Romans took from them), and had their own alphabet.\n\n===Roman times===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn 15 BC, Tyrol was conquered by Roman forces commanded by [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]]. The Romans established [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] as [[Roman province|province]]s of the [[Roman Empire]]. Raetia included Vinschgau, Burggrafenamt, Eisacktal, Wipptal, Oberinntal and parts of the Unterinntal. Noricum included Pustertal, Defereggen and parts of the Unterinntal to the right of the Ziller and the Inn. [[Bolzano]] and the extreme south of Tyrol belonged to the province of [[Triveneto|Venetia et Histria]].\n\nThe inhabitants adopted the Latin Language called vulgar Latin or the everyday spoken version vs. the standardized written formal form, and combined it with their own languages. The result was [[Romansh language|Romansh]], which is still spoken today and is one of the official languages of Switzerland.\n\nThe Romans constructed [[Roman roads|metalled roads]] guarded by [[Roman fort|fort]]s through Tyrol to connect the Italian peninsula and the lands beyond; notably the [[Via Claudia Augusta]] and the {{ill|Via Raetia|de}}. The Romans did not seem to find Tyrol an attractive area in which to build new towns, because there are few of them. One town they did build was [[Aguntum]], near modern [[Lienz]].\n\nIn late antiquity (from AD 476), Tyrol belonged to the [[Ostrogoths]], and it was included in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. In 534, the Ostrogoths lost Merrano, Val Venosta and Passer to the [[Franks]]. The Ostrogothic Kingdom collapsed in 553, after being overrun by [[Bajuvarians]] from the north and [[Lombards]] from the south. The Lombards established the [[Duchy of Tridentum]] (or, Trent; roughly corresponding to modern [[Trentino]]) in south Tyrol. [[Slavic people]]s, who had recently taken [[Carinthia]] from the Bajuvarians, settled in east Tyrol.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n{{main|County of Tyrol}}\nMost of Tyrol came under the control of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] (created {{circa|555}}). The southern parts, including Bolzano, [[Salorno]], and the right bank of the [[Adige]] (including [[Eppan an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Eppan]] and [[Kaltern an der Weinstra\u00dfe|Kaltern]]) remained under the Lombards. Tyrol was Christianised through the bishoprics of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Brixen]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento|Triento]]. The frontier remained the same though [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] times. The area was subject to ''Stammensgerechte'' ([[Ancient Germanic law]]s), such as ''[[Lex Romana Curiensis]]'', ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'', ''[[Lex Baiuvariorum]]'' and ''[[Leges Langobardorum]]''.\n\n[[File:Am Schloss Tirol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tyrol Castle]] in [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], near [[Merano]].]]\nIn 1027, Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], in order to secure the important route through the [[Brenner Pass]], allotted the left bank of the Adige (from [[Lana, South Tyrol|Lana]] to [[Mezzocorona]]) to the Duchy of Bavaria. During the 12th century, the local nobility went further: they built [[Tyrol Castle]] in the modern ''[[comune]]'' of [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]] in South Tyrol, near modern [[Merano]]; and around 1140, established the [[County of Tyrol]] as a state within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Counts of Tyrol were at first ''[[Vogt]]'' (underlords) subject to the Bishoprics of Brixen and Triento; but they had other ideas. They expanded their holdings at those bishoprics' expense. They displaced competing nobles like the {{ill|House of Eppan|de|Eppan (Adelsgeschlecht)}}, and declared their independence from the Duchy of Bavaria; though not without dispute. In 1228, they conceded the {{ill|Saalforste|de}} to the [[House of Wittelsbach]], rulers of Bavaria; as a result, that area remains part of Bavaria to this day.\n\nIn 1253, rulership of the County passed by inheritance to the [[Meinhardiner|Meinhardiner family]]. In 1335, the last male heir to the Meinhardiner lands, [[Henry of Bohemia]], died. His daughter, [[Margaret, Countess of Tyrol|Margaret]], thereupon became Countess of Tyrol; but her title was in doubt because of different laws in different lands as to what a woman could or could not inherit. She navigated her way between the competing claims of the Houses of Wittelsbach, [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and [[Habsburg]] by, in 1342, marrying [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria|Louis of Wittelsbach]]. Louis died in 1361. Margaret died in 1369, and bequeathed Tyrol to [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf of Habsburg]]. The various dynastic squabbles were resolved that same year by the {{ill|Treaty of Sch\u00e4rding|de|Frieden von Sch\u00e4rding}}, under which (for suitable compensation) the Wittelsbachs agreed to relinquish their claims to Tyrol in favour of the Habsburgs.\n\nWhen the Habsburgs took control of Tyrol, it had roughly its modern size. However, the [[Unterinntal]] downstream from [[Schwaz]] still belonged to Bavaria; the [[Zillertal]] and [[Brixental]] to [[Salzburg]]; [[Brixen]] and the [[Pustertal]] were episcopal territories, or part of the [[County of Gorizia]]. On the other hand, the [[Montafon]] and the [[Unterengadin]] were Tyrolean.\n\nTyrol was of great strategic importance to the Habsburgs. It controlled several important Alpine passes. It connected their landholdings in [[Further Austria]]. In 1406, as the Habsburg lands were split up by inheritance, Tyrol once again became a separate entity (a ''[[Landstand]]''), in which the greater landowners had the right to be consulted (''Mitspracherecht''). During a confusing succession of events, in 1420 [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]] moved the capital of Tyrol from [[Meran]] to [[Innsbruck]], and Meran lost its earlier importance.\n\n==Politics==\n===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===\n{{main|Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino}}\n[[File:Dreier Landtag.jpg|thumb|right|Dreier-Landtag]]\nThe [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] was founded in 1998. The aim is to strengthen cooperation between the separated countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/willkommen.asp|title=Willkommen|publisher=Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref> In several areas, such as mobility, agriculture, education and culture will be tried to promote exchange and to raise the awareness of the cultural and historical heritage of the region of Tyrol in the minds of the population. Cross-border projects will be initiated to improve the relationship between the different language groups.\nTo represent common ideas and values in Europe, the Euroregion has a joint office in [[Brussels]] since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europaregion.info/de/europa.asp|title=Europ\u00e4ische Integration und Euregio|publisher=Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref> The headquarters of the office is in [[Bolzano]]. Joint decisions are taken by organized three diet (in German: ''Dreier-Landtag''), which have been held since 1991 mostly every two to three years with the [[Landtag|state Diets]] of Trento (provincial council of Trentino), [[Landtag of South Tyrol|Bolzano]] (provincial council of South Tyrol) and Innsbruck (state council of Tyrol (State)). In 2011, the region was institutionalized and since then has its own legal entity.\n\n===Political Parties===\nPolitical parties in the Italian part of Tyrol (provinces of Bolzano and Trento) include:\n* [[Partito Democratico]] (PD)\n* [[S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei]] (SVP)\n* [[Movimento 5 Stelle|Movimento Cinque Stelle]] (M5S)\n* [[Lega Nord]] (LN)\n* [[Greens (South Tyrol)|Greens]]\n* [[South Tyrolean Freedom]]\n* [[Die Freiheitlichen]]\n* [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]] (PATT)\n\nThe Austrian part of Tyrol shares the Austrian party system:\n* [[Tiroler Volkspartei]]; organization of the [[\u00d6VP]] in the state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], which has dominated local politics since 1945\n* [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6)\n* [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6)\n* [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative]]\n* [[NEOS - The New Austria and Liberal Forum|NEOS]]\n\nThe multiplicity of parties is due to the fact that Tyrol lies in two different nation states and thus are politically independent of each other. Another reason for the large number of parties is the great independence of the two Provinces of [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]] and [[Trentino|Trento]]. By the second statute of autonomy in 1972, the province of Bolzano acquired much of the region's competences and since then has been mostly independent of the province of Trento. The second autonomy statute enabled the linguistic minorities to be better protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/politik-recht-aussenbeziehungen/autonomie/autonomiestatut.asp|title=Das Autonomiestatut|publisher=Province of South Tyrol|accessdate=2018-01-20}}</ref>\nThe [[regional council of Trentino-South Tyrol]], which consists of the two provincial councils of Bolzano and Trento, has less influence and competences. Thus, many parties determine their focus within the provinces. Other parties in [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], especially in South Tyrol, were founded on the example of Austrian parties and have many similarities with the [[List of political parties in Austria|parties in Austria]].\n\n==Economy==\nIn the economic sector statistics are shown, which are based largely on numbers and data of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]]. It lacks individual communities that are outside the Euroregion. As there are no 10,000 inhabitants living in these communities, the statistics hardly distort the territory of Tyrol and the remaining 1.8 million inhabitants.\n\nTyrol had a total GDP of 67.6 billion euros in 2014. Divided into individual countries, the State of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] generated 28.8 billion euros, the Province of [[South Tyrol]] 20.6 billion euros and the Province of [[Trentino]] 18.2 billion euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/zahlen-europaregion.asp|title=ZAHLEN ZUR EUROPAREGION|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-S\u00fcdtirol-Trentino|accessdate=2018-02-03}}</ref> In GDP per capita (2015), that means 39,300 euros/capita in the State of Tyrol, 42,400 euros/capita in South Tyrol and 35,500 euros/capita in Trentino.

The many small and medium-sized farms have shaped the landscape and culture in Tyrol for many centuries. In order to be competitive with larger farms outside Tyrol, there is a strong [[cooperative]] system in Tyrol.\nSouth of Tyrol, in the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], the cultivation of apples and wine plays an important role. So every tenth apple in Europe comes from [[South Tyrol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idm-suedtirol.com/de/ueber-suedtirol/1-jeder-10-europaeische-apfel-kommt-aus-suedtirol.html|title=Jeder 10.

Most of these were small businesses that were important only in the local area. A second wave of industrialization took place at the beginning of the 20th century. Particularly affected at that time was the city of [[Bolzano]] with the [[Italianization]] policy under Fascism in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hk-cciaa.bz.it/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/Scuola_economia/20181_materiale_didattico2014_ECONOMIC_HISTORY_de.pdf|title=ECONOMIC HISTORY|publisher=Handelskammer Bozen|accessdate=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, approximately 10% of the workplaces in all parts of the country were active in the manufacturing sector.

The craft still plays a special role throughout the region. A large part of these craft businesses are still partially small-structured and family businesses. From an economic point of view, the energy sector is important in the secondary sector. Much of the electricity produced is generated by [[hydropower]].\n\n===Tertiary sector===\n[[File:Riva del Garda , Panorama - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|A known city for tourism: [[Riva del Garda]] on [[Lake Garda]]]]\nThe most important sector in Tyrol is the tertiary sector. Especially tourism has a special position in this region. Due to the connection of the areas by the railway in the 19th century, many villages in Tyrol developed into popular tourism locations. The construction of the Brenner motorway in the 1960s gave region in the 20th century a renewed upswing in the tourism branch. Today, [[Merano]], [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]] or [[Riva del Garda]] are among the most important tourism destinations in the Alpine region.

The most important route between northern and southern Europe, the Brenner route, traverses the entire region. At 1370 m above the Adriatic, the [[Brenner Pass]] is the lowest pass crossing of the [[main chain of the Alps]].\nDue to the linguistic diversity and the climatic transition from [[temperate climate]] ([[alpine climate]]) to [[mediterranean climate]], the area is regarded as a bridge between the Italian and German speaking countries.\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:Flughafen Innsbruck - 12-06-05 by ralfr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Innsbruck Airport]]]]\nThe most important airport in Tyrol is [[Innsbruck Airport]].

The airfield in Cortina was closed in 1976 due to a crash.\n\n===Road transport===\nHighways in Tyrol are the Brenner motorway and the Inntal motorway. The Brenner motorway runs from [[Innsbruck]] (in Austria [[Brenner Autobahn|A13]]) to Modena (in Italy [[Autostrada A22 (Italy)|A22]]). Together with the Inntal motorway from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Kufstein]] is the part of the [[European route E45]]. The dual carriageway from [[Merano]] to [[Bolzano]] (MeBo) ends in Bolzano South in the Brenner motorway. Important road section in [[Trentino]], next to the Brenner motorway, is the SS 47 (Strada Statale 47), which connects via [[Sugana Valley]] [[Trento]] with [[Padova]]. A large part of this route is dual-lane and flows into the Brenner state road (SS 12).\nDue to the [[Alps]], there are many [[mountain pass]]es that connect valleys. The most important pass roads for transit trade are the [[Reschen Pass]] and [[Brenner Pass]]. Popular pass roads include the [[Stelvio Pass]], [[Arlberg Pass]], [[Karerpass|Karer Pass]], [[Mendel Pass]] and the [[Gardena Pass]]. The Provinces of [[Trentino|Trento]] and [[South Tyrol|Bolzano]] have been responsible for the preservation and management of the state roads in their provinces since 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/news/de/news.asp?news_action=4&news_article_id=590799|title=ANAS-Immobilien gehen an das Land \u00fcber \u2013 Vertrag nun unterzeichnet|publisher=Provinz Bozen|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:Nuovo Treno Val Pusteria.JPG|thumb|left|Pustertal railway]]\nThe most important railway line in Tyrol is the Brenner Line via the [[Brenner Pass]]. The [[Brenner Railway]] was opened in 1867 and runs from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Verona]] via the cities of [[Bolzano]] and [[Trento]]. Together with the [[New Lower Inn Valley Railway|Lower Inn Valley Railway]] in [[North Tyrol]], this section of the route is part of the important European railway axis [[Berlin-Palermo railway axis|Berlin-Palermo]], which connects northern Europe with southern Europe across the Alps. With the construction of the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]] and its completion in 2027, transit traffic on the rail will be promoted and relocated. After completion, the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]], together with the [[Innsbruck bypass]], will be the longest railway tunnel in the world at 64&nbsp;km and will reduce the travel time between [[Bolzano]] and [[Innsbruck]] from 2 hours to 45 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tt.com/politik/landespolitik/13383174-91/tirol-und-s\u00fcdtirol-feierten-150-jahre-brennerbahn-mit-railjet.csp|title=Tirol und S\u00fcdtirol feierten 150 Jahre Brennerbahn mit Railjet|publisher=Tiroler Tageszeitung|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/neuer-brenner-tunnel-mit-tempo-250-durch-die-alpen-13671819.html|title=Mit Tempo 250 durch die Alpen|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n\nFurther important railway lines in Tyrol are the [[Arlberg railway]], [[Zillertal Railway|Zillertal railway]], [[Salzburg-Tyrol Railway|Salzburg-Tyrol railway]], [[Pustertal railway]] with continuation of the [[Drautal railway]], the [[railway line Bolzano-Merano]] and the continuation of the [[Vinschgau railway]], the [[Trento\u2013Mal\u00e8\u2013Mezzana railway]] and the [[Trento\u2013Venice railway|Valsugana railway]], which leads from [[Trento]] to [[Venice]] over the [[Sugana Valley]]. Cross-border connections are offered only a few. The [[\u00d6BB]] travels over the Brenner Pass on the [[Eurocity]] trains and several regional trains connect [[South Tyrol]] with [[North|North Tyrol]] an [[East Tyrol]]. The [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] has set itself the goal of promoting and expanding cross-border connections. The aim is to shift traffic through the Alps to sustainable means of transport, thus protecting the Alpine environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europaregion.info/de/mobilitaet-verkehr.asp|title=MOBILIT\u00c4T UND VERKEHR|publisher=Europaregion Tirol-S\u00fcdtirol-Trentino}}</ref>\n\n===Local public transport===\nMany villages and communities are difficult to reach because of the large differences in altitude, so the region sets much on [[ropeway]] concepts. Although most of the [[Aerial lift|cable cars]] are located in ski resorts, they are also used for the local public transport. Known cable cars in Tyrol are the [[Ritten cable car]] in [[Bolzano]], the [[Sardagna cable car]] in [[Trento]] and the [[Nordkette Cable Car|Nordkette cable car]] in [[Innsbruck]]. Also [[funicular]] railways are being built to cope with the differences in altitude more quickly. Famous funiculars are among others the [[Hungerburgbahn]] in [[Innsbruck]] and the [[Mendel funicular]] in [[Kaltern]].\n\nLocal public transport is usually offered with intercity buses or city buses. The city of [[Innsbruck Tramway|Innsbruck]] has its own tram network. Another [[Rittnerbahn|tram]] is located in [[Ritten]]. The cities of [[Bolzano Tramway|Bolzano]], [[Meran Tramway|Merano]] and [[Trento]] formerly had their own tram network, but these were displaced and replaced by the city buses and private transport in the 50s and 60s.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Tyrolean culture has been cultivated for several centuries and passed on to future generations. The state border between South and North Tyrol is more a political border and is considered less as a cultural border. Many traditions are cultivated throughout the Tyrolean region and show little differences. In all cultural areas such as food, dress or customs there are many similarities. Nevertheless, the individual language groups, especially the minority languages, try to maintain and promote their own linguistic identity.\n\n=== Tyrolean cuisine ===\n[[File:S\u00fcdtiroler Speck g.g.A. aufgeschnitten.jpg|thumb|200px|left|South [[Tyrolean Speck]]]]\nThe [[Austrian cuisine#Tyrol|Tyrolean cuisine]] has similarities with the [[Austrian cuisine]] and is characterized by its alpine influence. Also the historical influence of the former [[K.U.K. Monarchy]] can be found in the Tyrolean dishes. These include dishes such as [[goulash]], [[Kaiserschmarrn]] and [[apple strudel]] which are consumed in large parts of the [[Danube monarchy]] and today still in Tyrol. Since the region is still relatively strong agricultural and peasant today, also many peasant dishes are offered on the farms. [[Schlutzkrapfen]], [[Kn\u00f6del|boiled dumplings]] or cold cuts with [[Tyrolean Speck|bacon (in German: ''Speck'')]] or [[Tyrolean_grey_cheese|grey cheese]] is eaten on the farms.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tirol.at/reisefuehrer/kultur-leben/kulinarik|title=Essen und trinken in Tirol|publisher=Tirol Marketing|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n\nThe Tyrolean dishes show only slight differences throughout Tyrol. Due to the Mediterranean conditions in the southern part of Tyrol, a lot of wine is grown and is therefore also an important part of the Tyrolean dish, especially in [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]]. Famous wines from this area are the [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]], [[Pinot Blanc]], [[Pinot Grigio]] and [[Chardonnay]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.suedtirolwein.com/de/suedtirol-wein.html|title=S\u00fcdtirol Wein|publisher=S\u00fcdtirol Wein|accessdate=2018-01-21}}</ref> Furthermore, a lot of apples are grown in the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]]. In this region also a food culture is cultivated with a mixture of Italian and Tyrolean specialties.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.suedtirol.info/de/erleben/essen-trinken|title=Essen und trinken in S\u00fcdtirol|publisher=IDM S\u00fcdtirol|accessdate=2018-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.trentino.com/de/freizeit-aktiv/essen-trinken/|title=Essen und trinken|publisher=trentino.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Tyrolean Rifles ===\n[[File:Sch\u00fctzenkompaniecastelam.jpg|thumb|right|Trentino Rifle Company in front of [[Castle of Castellano]]]]\nThe Tyrolean Rifles were a militia organised in case of an attack on [[Crown land (Austria)|crown land]], which required Tyrol to defend its territory. The militia consisted mostly of citizens and peasants who were responsible only for the defence of their own land and were not obliged to go to war on behalf of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. They were authorised by an order signed by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]] in 1511 that remained valid until 1918. The Tyrolean Rifles became known in [[Tyrolean Rebellion|1809]] when Tyrolese peasants rose up and fought against the French-Bavarian occupation under [[Napoleon]]. The ensuing four [[Battles of Bergisel]] were led by [[Andreas Hofer]]. The Rifles were also used in [[World War I]] in 1915 on the [[Dolomite front]].\nAfter the separation of Tyrol and the downfall of the monarchy, the companies also lost their task of defending their country. Nevertheless, they remained as a non-governmental organization.\nToday, the Rifles are responsible as an organization for the preservation of the Tyrolean culture and are always present at important political events in Tyrol.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://schuetzen.com/organisation/ssb/ueber-uns/|title=\u00dcber uns|publisher=S\u00fcdtiroler Sch\u00fctzenbund|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n\n===Customs===\nMany Tyrolean customs were created centuries ago and are passed on by the population for the next generations. Typical in the Alpine region are the many individual customs in the valleys. Due to the seclusion of the valleys, the locals developed their own customs. Many customs have been created by legends and narratives, others by the close connection to the church. There are also traditions that are cultivated everywhere in the Tyrolean region and do not differ from other valleys and villages. These customs give local people an identity and thus feel the community more connected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tirol.at/reisefuehrer/kultur-leben/brauchtum|title=Brauchtum|publisher=Tirol Marketing|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Krampus2.jpg|[[Krampus]] in [[Toblach]].

Many athletes, such as [[Gustav Thoeni]], [[Benjamin Raich]], [[Carolina Kostner]], [[Gregor Schlierenzauer]], [[Toni Sailer]] and [[Armin Zoeggeler]] have already won overall World Cups and medals at World Championships and Olympic Games.\nEven in summer sports, several athletes from Tyrol were and still are among the best in the world. In water jumping [[Tania Cagnotto]] and [[Klaus Dibiasi]] won several medals. In cycling, [[Francesco Moser]] won the [[Giro d'Italia]]. [[Andreas Seppi]] played against the best tennis players in the world for many years. In [[bouldering]] [[Anna St\u00f6hr]] was one of the best in the world.\nMany Tyrolean mountaineers such as [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Hans Kammerlander]] influenced the [[alpinism]].\n\n===Football===\nThe [[FC Wacker Innsbruck (2002)|FC Wacker Innsbruck]] is one of the most traditional and successful clubs in Austria. Since the club was founded in 1915 and several name changes, the football club has won ten times the Austrian Championship and seven times the Austrian Cup. In 1987, it reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA CUP]]. In 1970, the team defeated Real Madrid in Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fc-wacker-innsbruck.at/2-uncategorised/1400-erfolge.html|title=Erfolge|publisher=FC Wacker Innsbruck|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> Currently (2018) Wacker Innsbruck plays in the \"[[Austrian Football First League|Erste Liga]]\" (second highest category of Austria).\n\nIn the Region of [[Trentino-South Tyrol]], the [[FC S\u00fcdtirol]] and [[A.C. Trento S.C.S.D.|AC Trento]] are the two most important clubs. Both teams participated in the Italian [[Serie C]] (third highest league in Italy) for several seasons. The AC Trento has a long history until 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.actrento.com/storia/|title=storia|publisher=AC Trento|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> FC S\u00fcdtirol was founded in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fc-suedtirol.com/de/fc-s\u00fcdtirol/geschichte/4-0.html|title=Geschichte|publisher=FC S\u00fcdtirol|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> AC Trento are currently (2018) playing in the Italian [[Serie D]] (fourth highest league in Italy) and FC S\u00fcdtirol in [[Serie C]].

Important clubs are the [[HC Bolzano]] and the [[HC Innsbruck]]. Both teams play in the [[EBEL]]. The HC Innsbruck, formerly [[EV Innsbruck]], won the Austrian championship seven times. With 19 won Italian championships, the HC Bolzano is the record champion in Italy. The club celebrated the biggest international successes by winning the [[Alpenliga]], the [[EBEL]] and the [[Six Nations Tournament (ice hockey)|Six Nations Tournament]]  with [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hcb.net/de/verein/hall-of-fame-2/|title=Hall of fame|publisher=HC Bozen|accessdate=2018-01-28}}</ref> The Italian ice hockey league consists mostly of South Tyrolean teams. 5 of the 8 Italian teams in the [[Alps Hockey League]] come from South Tyrol ([[HC Neumarkt-Egna]], [[HC Pustertal]], [[Ritten Sport]], [[HC Gardena]] and [[WSV Sterzing Broncos]]). In this league three more Tyrolean teams play ([[SG Cortina]], [[HC Fassa]] and [[EC Kitzb\u00fchel]]).\n\nIn 2005, the [[2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] was held in [[Innsbruck]] and Vienna.

Tzigara was a member of the ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society, holding positions at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|National School of Fine Arts]], the [[University of Bucharest]] and lastly the [[Chernivtsi University|University of Cern\u0103u\u021bi]]. During his youth, he was secretary to [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], the [[King of Romania]]. Close to the royal family, he also served as head of the [[Funda\u021biile Regale|Carol I Academic Foundation]], where he set up a large collection of [[photographic plate]]s. Tzigara achieved fame in 1906 as founder of the \"National Museum\", nucleus of the present-day [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]], but was also involved in arranging and preserving the [[Theodor Aman]] art fund.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 irritated Romanian public opinion by accepting to serve in a puppet administration set up by the [[Central Powers]]. Although his conduct was considered benign by the legitimate government, it drew him accusations of [[collaborationism]] from within academia, and aggravated his long-standing conflict with historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the [[interwar period]], but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several [[World's fair|world fairs]], the first-ever lecturer on [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Romania]]'s staff, the editor in chief of ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy|Academy]].

His purported father, Carol I, died in September 1914. According to his Archbishop Netzhammer, Tzigara was deeply affected by the event: \"Like a child, he loosened his suffering, deploring in front of me this terrible and unexpected loss\".<ref name=\"abmoartea\"/> By then, however, Tzigara had befriended Ferdinand I, the new king, and was an admirer of Ferdinand's wife, [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. He found that Ferdinand was \"gentle\", \"jocular\" and usually self-effacing, \"in all things the opposite of his uncle\" Carol I.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/> In Queen Marie, the art historian recognized a political woman, more active in public affairs than Carol's Elisabeth.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.100</ref> Tzigara also shared Marie's artistic taste, including her passion for the work of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist]] sculptors [[Oscar Sp\u00e4the]] and [[Friedrich Storck]] (whom, in 1903, he had called them \"innovators of Romanian sculpture\").<ref>\u0218otropa, p.21</ref>\n\nUnlike Ferdinand and his [[Francophile]] circle, who desired a Romanian alliance with the [[Entente Powers|Entente]] for the sake of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|union with Transylvania]], Tzigara was opposed to any move against Germany. He represented the [[Germanophile]] lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, [[Constantin Litzica]].<ref name=\"lb108\">Boia, p.108</ref> For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).<ref>Boia, p.104</ref>\n\nThe [[Romania in World War I|subsequent campaign]] ended abruptly in southern Romania's invasion by the [[Central Powers]] (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to [[Ia\u0219i]], they appointed Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref name=\"lb327\"/><ref name=\"dhradio\"/> He stayed behind in Bucharest and met with [[August von Mackensen]], head of the occupation forces. As a result of this encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], [[Petre P. Carp]]. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple [[Lupu Kostaki]].<ref>Boia, p.327; Ornea (1998), p.390-393</ref> Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: \"Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness.\"<ref>Ornea (1998), p.391</ref> Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed.<ref>Ornea (1998), p.393</ref> Maiorescu himself explained that it was a question of principle: \"Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If [Mackensen] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me.\"<ref>[[Ion S. Floru]], \"\u00cent\u00e2lniri cu Titu Maiorescu\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', December 1995, p.51</ref>\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|December 13|1916|November 30}}, the art historian took over as Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This proved to be a highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's [[Interwar period|interwar]] career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved.<ref name=\"lb327\"/> Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General [[Alexandru Musta\u021b\u0103]], could not speak any [[German language|German]].<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref name=\"lb327\"/> Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Minister of Education]] in spring 1917.<ref name=\"lb108\"/> Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer [[I. A. Bassarabescu]] into his Police apparatus, obtaining his release from German [[internment]] and appointing him head of division.<ref>Boia, p.166</ref> Reportedly, he did the same for philosopher [[Mircea Florian]], who became his Carol I Foundation subordinate.<ref>Boia, p.350</ref>\n\nAs recorded by Archbishop Netzhammer, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 was open and cooperative in his relationship with the new authorities and the [[Regat Germans|German community]].<ref name=\"abmeteor\"/> In September 1917, the Romanian scholar greeted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]], who was visiting the occupied half of Romania. Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the [[Curtea de Arge\u0219 Cathedral]], where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb.<ref name=\"lb328\">Boia, p.328</ref> Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby [[tie pin]].<ref name=\"lb328\"/>\n\nTzigara-Samurca\u0219 nonetheless had a complex relationship with his German supervisors. He refused to cooperate with them on several occasions, objecting to the creation of a German Institute within the University, and being strongly opposed to the Central Powers' interventions on [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Bucharest Royal Palace]] grounds.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> In late 1916 and early 1917, he was in intense correspondence with [[Ioan Bianu]], a fellow scholar and disillusioned Germanophile, who complained about the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] pressures on the [[Romanian Academy]] and asked Tzigara to intervene on his colleagues' behalf.<ref>Boia, p.175-176, 328</ref> On one occasion, as a result of Bianu's plea, Tzigara sent in his policemen to prevent German soldiers from stealing the Academy's firewood reserves.<ref>Boia, p.176, 328</ref> Boia argues that the main objective of Tzigara's term, \"the security of people and property\", was competently met.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> The same is noted by Ornea, who cautions: \"the nude fact of his, all things considered, willing collaboration with the German occupier, is still a litigious issue\".<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/> The Police chief was also critical of his more docile colleagues: as recorded in Marghiloman's diary, Tzigara was present at the October 1917 [[Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Palace]] gala organized by Mackensen (October 1917), but was irritated to find himself in the company of junior bureaucrats who were well liked by the Germans. He referred to this category, which included poet [[Luca Caragiale]], as the \"nippers\".<ref>Boia, p.203</ref> In December of the same year, Caragiale enraged Tzigara by going over his head: the poet used German connections to obtain Police guards at an official function, after Tzigara had refused to grant his request.<ref>Boia, p.203-204</ref>\n\n===Collaborationism scandal and late 1920s===\nIn January 1918, while the Ia\u0219i authorities were considering a way out of the war, Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 handed in his resignation to the Germans.<ref name=\"lb327\"/> A [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace with the Central Powers]] followed: in March\u2013April, the new [[national unity government]] of Marghiloman reassigned him to the position of Police chief.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref name=\"lb328\"/> This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918\u2014that is, three days after the [[Armistice with Germany]] reshuffled Romania's commitments.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|Romanian Railways]] workers.<ref>V. Liveanu, \"Note \u0219i \u00eensemn\u0103ri. Cu privire la evenimentele din 26(13) decembrie 1918\", in ''Studii. Revist\u0103 de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1958, p.97</ref>\n\nRomania's sudden return to Francophilia had also brought Marghiloman's downfall, described by Tzigara as an anti-Conservative \"''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''\".<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/> Zigu Ornea finds this expression of resentment especially problematic, since, he argued, it meant that Tzigara placed Germanopilia above the establishment of [[Greater Romania]]: \"[he] understood next to nothing from the reality of the wartime political phenomenon.\"<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/>\n\nThe end of the war signified a slump in Tzigara's career.

Tzigara was a member of the ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society, holding positions at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|National School of Fine Arts]], the [[University of Bucharest]] and lastly the [[Chernivtsi University|University of Cern\u0103u\u021bi]]. During his youth, he was secretary to [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], the [[King of Romania]]. Close to the royal family, he also served as head of the [[Funda\u021biile Regale|Carol I Academic Foundation]], where he set up a large collection of [[photographic plate]]s. Tzigara achieved fame in 1906 as founder of the \"National Museum\", nucleus of the present-day [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]], but was also involved in arranging and preserving the [[Theodor Aman]] art fund.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 irritated Romanian public opinion by accepting to serve in a puppet administration set up by the [[Central Powers]]. Although his conduct was considered benign by the legitimate government, it drew him accusations of [[collaborationism]] from within academia, and aggravated his long-standing conflict with historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the [[interwar period]], but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several [[World's fair|world fairs]], the first-ever lecturer on [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Romania]]'s staff, the editor in chief of ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy|Academy]]. His post-[[World War II]] years were spent in obscurity, owing to his ideological incompatibility with the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]].\n\nAlexandru Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 was alleged to be Carol I's illegitimate son, a rumor fueled by his closeness to court. He was himself the father of artist [[Ana Tzigara Berza]], and father in law of folklorist [[Marcu Berza]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Origins and early life===\nA native of [[Bucharest]], Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 was born on {{OldStyleDate|April 4|1872|March 23}},<ref name=\"culturatzs\">{{in lang|ro}} [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/01/intre-orient-si-occident-%E2%80%93-arhiva-de-imagine-alexandru-tzigara-samurcas/ \"\u00centre Orient \u0219i Occident \u2013 Arhiva de imagine Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca\u0219\"], in ''Cultura'', March 19, 2011</ref><ref name=\"mparhiva\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Mihai Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=23503 \"''Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca\u0219''\"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 519, April 2010</ref> and baptized into the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"abmoartea\">{{in lang|ro}} Alexandru Barnea, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/moartea-lui-carol-i-2874073/ \"Moartea lui Carol I\"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 20, 2006</ref> A popular rumor has him as the illegitimate son of ''[[Domnitor]]'' Carol I, the future King of Romania, to whom Tzigara was especially close in later years.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Z.

His purported father, Carol I, died in September 1914. According to his Archbishop Netzhammer, Tzigara was deeply affected by the event: \"Like a child, he loosened his suffering, deploring in front of me this terrible and unexpected loss\".<ref name=\"abmoartea\"/> By then, however, Tzigara had befriended Ferdinand I, the new king, and was an admirer of Ferdinand's wife, [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. He found that Ferdinand was \"gentle\", \"jocular\" and usually self-effacing, \"in all things the opposite of his uncle\" Carol I.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/> In Queen Marie, the art historian recognized a political woman, more active in public affairs than Carol's Elisabeth.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.100</ref> Tzigara also shared Marie's artistic taste, including her passion for the work of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist]] sculptors [[Oscar Sp\u00e4the]] and [[Friedrich Storck]] (whom, in 1903, he had called them \"innovators of Romanian sculpture\").<ref>\u0218otropa, p.21</ref>\n\nUnlike Ferdinand and his [[Francophile]] circle, who desired a Romanian alliance with the [[Entente Powers|Entente]] for the sake of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|union with Transylvania]], Tzigara was opposed to any move against Germany. He represented the [[Germanophile]] lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, [[Constantin Litzica]].<ref name=\"lb108\">Boia, p.108</ref> For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).<ref>Boia, p.104</ref>\n\nThe [[Romania in World War I|subsequent campaign]] ended abruptly in southern Romania's invasion by the [[Central Powers]] (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to [[Ia\u0219i]], they appointed Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref name=\"lb327\"/><ref name=\"dhradio\"/> He stayed behind in Bucharest and met with [[August von Mackensen]], head of the occupation forces. As a result of this encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], [[Petre P. Carp]]. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple [[Lupu Kostaki]].<ref>Boia, p.327; Ornea (1998), p.390-393</ref> Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: \"Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness.\"<ref>Ornea (1998), p.391</ref> Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed.<ref>Ornea (1998), p.393</ref> Maiorescu himself explained that it was a question of principle: \"Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If [Mackensen] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me.\"<ref>[[Ion S. Floru]], \"\u00cent\u00e2lniri cu Titu Maiorescu\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', December 1995, p.51</ref>\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|December 13|1916|November 30}}, the art historian took over as Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This proved to be a highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's [[Interwar period|interwar]] career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved.<ref name=\"lb327\"/> Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General [[Alexandru Musta\u021b\u0103]], could not speak any [[German language|German]].<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref name=\"lb327\"/> Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Minister of Education]] in spring 1917.<ref name=\"lb108\"/> Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer [[I. A.

Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the [[Curtea de Arge\u0219 Cathedral]], where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb.<ref name=\"lb328\">Boia, p.328</ref> Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby [[tie pin]].<ref name=\"lb328\"/>\n\nTzigara-Samurca\u0219 nonetheless had a complex relationship with his German supervisors. He refused to cooperate with them on several occasions, objecting to the creation of a German Institute within the University, and being strongly opposed to the Central Powers' interventions on [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Bucharest Royal Palace]] grounds.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> In late 1916 and early 1917, he was in intense correspondence with [[Ioan Bianu]], a fellow scholar and disillusioned Germanophile, who complained about the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] pressures on the [[Romanian Academy]] and asked Tzigara to intervene on his colleagues' behalf.<ref>Boia, p.175-176, 328</ref> On one occasion, as a result of Bianu's plea, Tzigara sent in his policemen to prevent German soldiers from stealing the Academy's firewood reserves.<ref>Boia, p.176, 328</ref> Boia argues that the main objective of Tzigara's term, \"the security of people and property\", was competently met.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> The same is noted by Ornea, who cautions: \"the nude fact of his, all things considered, willing collaboration with the German occupier, is still a litigious issue\".<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/> The Police chief was also critical of his more docile colleagues: as recorded in Marghiloman's diary, Tzigara was present at the October 1917 [[Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Palace]] gala organized by Mackensen (October 1917), but was irritated to find himself in the company of junior bureaucrats who were well liked by the Germans. He referred to this category, which included poet [[Luca Caragiale]], as the \"nippers\".<ref>Boia, p.203</ref> In December of the same year, Caragiale enraged Tzigara by going over his head: the poet used German connections to obtain Police guards at an official function, after Tzigara had refused to grant his request.<ref>Boia, p.203-204</ref>\n\n===Collaborationism scandal and late 1920s===\nIn January 1918, while the Ia\u0219i authorities were considering a way out of the war, Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 handed in his resignation to the Germans.<ref name=\"lb327\"/> A [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace with the Central Powers]] followed: in March\u2013April, the new [[national unity government]] of Marghiloman reassigned him to the position of Police chief.<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref name=\"lb328\"/> This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918\u2014that is, three days after the [[Armistice with Germany]] reshuffled Romania's commitments.<ref name=\"lb328\"/> During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|Romanian Railways]] workers.<ref>V.

His imperial tie pin, Boia notes, became a \"''[[corpus delicti]]''\" for those accusing Tzigara of [[treason]].<ref name=\"lb328\"/> Such accusations were given ample exposure in Rector [[Ion Atanasiu]]'s essay ''R\u0103t\u0103ciri na\u021bionale'' (\"National Ravings\", 1919), answered to in detail by Tzigara's own ''[[List of Latin phrases: P#pro domo|pro domo]]'', ''M\u0103rturisiri silite'' (\"Forced Confessions\", 1920), and later by his posthumously published ''Memorii'' (\"Memoirs\").<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/><ref>Boia, p.328, 353</ref> Athanasiu was the first who suggested holding Tzigara accountable for his wartime behavior, and, in his University report, alluded to the possibility of sacking both him and the Germanophile biologist [[Victor Babe\u0219]].<ref>Boia, p.353</ref> Ornea finds that, in those years, Athanasiu and Tzigara's traditional foe Nicolae Iorga were waging \"a veritable war against Tzigara-Samurca\u0219\".<ref name=\"zomarturisiri\"/>\n\nTzigara was omitted from an early purge of University Germanophiles, but, on November 29, 1919, was subjected to questioning by Rector Atanasiu, Iorga and the Board of Professors. As he later recalled, his defense tactic was to recall that, back in 1906, Iorga himself was seen as a radical [[Francophobia|Francophobe]] (''see [[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'').<ref name=\"lb353-354\">Boia, p.353-354</ref> On Iorga and Atanasiu's proposal, but against the advice of [[Ion Cantacuzino]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]], the Board took a vote to ban Tzigara-Samurca\u0219; the result was indecisive, and Tzigara preserved his chair.<ref>Boia, p.354, 355-356</ref> Atanasiu however took the vote as evidence that Tzigara had lost his support, and requested a decision from higher authorities. As Boia notes, this was a political miscalculation: the anti-Germanophile lobby had been defeated in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] by [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], who could not be expected to grant Atanasiu a victory.<ref>Boia, p.354-355</ref> In the end, Education Minister and zoologist [[Ioan Borcea]] sent a letter to Atanasiu, asking him to desist frustrating Tzigara \"in his attributions without legal decision\", adding: \"Especially at this moment in time, we find it necessary that peace and harmony be restored for University to function properly.\"<ref>Boia, p.354</ref> These and other moral defeats prompted Atanasiu to present his resignation, which came with his final protest that Minister Borcea had snubbed University during the \"Tzigara-Samurca\u0219 affair\".<ref>Boia, p.355</ref> In later years, Tzigara took his main accusers, Iorga and journalist [[Stelian Popescu]], to court, in what became two celebrity trials.<ref name=\"dhradio\"/>\n\nAs noted by literary critic Dumitru H\u00eencu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments.<ref name=\"dhradio\"/> He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: \"Iorga is jealous that he sees you coming over to visit with us.\"<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[G.

He was the eldest son of a blacksmith, also named Thomas Tompion, and probably worked as a blacksmith until 1664 when he became an apprentice of a London clockmaker. Very little of his earlier years is known. The first reference to Tompion in London is recorded around the end of 1670 in Water Lane (now Whitefriars Street) off Fleet Street.\n\nHis early clockmaking style shows a strong connection with [[Joseph Knibb]]. This is of interest as Tompion's most important early patron was the scientist [[Robert Hooke]] who may well have known the Knibb family, as both were in Oxford. Hooke's relationship with Tompion was the key to his success as it opened doors to royal patronage as well as giving him access to the latest technology.\n\nTompion's excellence was based on the sound design of his productions as well as the high quality of the materials used.

These were fixed in the Octagon room, each was driven by a [[deadbeat escapement]] designed by [[Richard Towneley]], with both clocks only needing to be wound once a year. They proved to be very accurate and were instrumental in achieving the correct calculations needed for astronomical observations.\n\n[[Image:T Tompion and G Graham.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque in [[Fleet Street]], London, commemorating Thomas Tompion and [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]]]\n[[Image:Hampton Court Palace (3037893374).jpg|thumb|right|Sundial made by Thomas Tompion at Hampton Court, c. 1680]]\nDue to his relationship with the scientist [[Robert Hooke]] he made some of the first [[watch]]es with [[balance spring]]s, these had the potential to be much more accurate than earlier watches. Several different kinds were experimented with, including an early type with double balances geared together in order to eliminate errors of motion.  One of these was made for [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and was signed ''\"[[Robert Hooke]] invent. 1658. T. Tompion fecit, 1675\"''. [[William Derham]] mentions this in his book ''The Artificial Clockmaker''.<ref>Derham (William) M.A. \"The Artificial Clock-maker: A Treatise of Watch and Clock-work etc.\", First edition published 1696 by James Knapton at the Crown in St. Paul's Church-yard, London.</ref> This watch, it seems, has not survived. The final form of balance spring arrangement used by Tompion was a plain spiral with a single balance, indeed the same arrangement employed by [[Christiaan_Huygens#Balance_spring_watch|Christiaan Huygens]] in watches made for him by Thuret. A few of Tompion's early spiral balance spring movements were also of a similar specification to the Huygens/Thuret pattern as they had a standing barrel and no [[fusee (horology)|fusee]]. Huygens imagined that the latter would not be necessary as the spiral spring would render the balance isochronous. Tompion must have soon found this rather optimistic surmise was however incorrect, as all Tompion's subsequent spiral balance spring movements have fusees, and this design became the standard pattern in English watches throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nIt is often stated that Tompion invented the particular type of balance spring regulation in pocket watches widely used until the late 19th century. This has the curb pins mounted on a sector rack, and moved by a pinion on which is mounted a graduated and numbered disc. While this system was used by Tompion, many refer to it incorrectly as the \"Tompion regulator\". However, he certainly did not invent this system, as such regulating devices were already in use by the 1670s on French balance spring watches of the Thuret pattern.\n\nAs England's most prominent [[watchmaker]], Tompion's workshop built about 5,500 watches and 650 clocks during his career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clocks And Watches (T) \u2013 Encyclopedia Of Antiques |work=Antiques Digest \u2013 Lost Knowledge From The Past |publisher=Old and Sold Antiques Auction & Marketplace |url= http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/clocks-t.shtml |accessdate=14 May 2008}}</ref> Tompion's clocks are known for their ingenuity of design and robust construction. His three-train ''[[grande sonnerie]]'' bracket clocks are masterpieces. Those interested in mechanics are particularly attracted to the mechanisms of such clocks and his repeating watches as they are quite complex, indeed it could even be said over-complex, though efficient in operation. He shares this characteristic with the later French-Swiss watchmaker [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]].\n\nAnother of Tompion's innovations was to create a numbering system for his spring and [[longcase clocks]], which is thought to be the first time that a serial numbering system was applied to manufactured goods.\n\n===Later life===\nTompion went into partnership with Edward Banger in 1701 until about 1707 or 1708, when it was dissolved in circumstances which are not at all clear.

Some of his later productions are jointly signed, and mysteriously some clocks have this signature on a separate plate which overlays that of Tompion and Banger engraved on the dial plate proper.\n\n[[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]], went on to further develop the designs of both scientific instruments as well as clocks and watches after Tompion's death, and he also continued Tompion's numbering system for his clocks and watches.\n\nThomas Tompion died on 20 November 1713 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], George Graham being buried alongside him in 1751.

He was the seventh [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] and the ninth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]]. He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections. He also helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|an asylum in Lexington]].<ref name = \"Gatton\">{{cite journal |last1=Gatton |first1=John Spalding |title=\"Mr. Clay & I got stung\": Harriet Martineau in Lexington |journal=The Kentucky Review |date=Fall 1979 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=55-56 |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&context=kentucky-review |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=402}} Thomas (who had served some jail-time in Philadelphia in 1829-1830)<ref name = \"Gatton\"/> became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the Asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=285\u2013286}} After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=288}}\n\nThey initially lived in downtown Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Lexington known as [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]]. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Biddle]]'', Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first [[amicus curiae]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=156}}\n\n===Early political career===\n\nClay began dabbling in politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of [[internal improvements]], which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the [[United States Senate]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn|When elected by the legislature, Clay was below the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|constitutionally required age of thirty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref> It is unclear whether the state legislature or Clay himself knew that he did not meet the Senate's age requirement at the time, though he did know of the issue later in his career.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=26}} Such an age qualification issue [[United States Senate#Qualifications|has occurred with only three other U.S. Senators]]: [[Armistead Thomson Mason]], [[John Jordan Crittenden]], and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]].}} During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including [[Chesapeake & Delaware Canal|a canal connecting]] the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=64-67}}\n\nAfter Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|speaker]] of the state house of representatives.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=10\u201310}} That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], President Jefferson arranged passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]]. In support of Jefferson's policy, which limited trade with foreign powers, Clay introduced a resolution to require legislators to wear [[Spinning (textiles)|homespun]] suits rather than those made of imported British [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=70-71}} The vast majority of members of the state house voted for the measure, but [[Humphrey Marshall (politician)|Humphrey Marshall]], an \"aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue,\" voted against it.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} In early 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which took place on January 19.{{sfn|Remini|1991|p=55}} While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall fought the duel with intent of killing their opponent.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=72-73}} They each had three turns to shoot; both were hit by bullets, but both survived.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} Clay quickly recovered from his injury, and received only a minor censure from the Kentucky legislature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=74}}\n\nIn 1810, U.S. Senator [[Buckner Thruston]] resigned to accept appointment to a position as a federal judge, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill Thruston's seat. Clay quickly emerged as a fierce critic of British attacks on American shipping, becoming part of an informal group of \"[[war hawk]]s\" who favored expansionist policies.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=26\u201330}} He also advocated the annexation of [[West Florida]], which was controlled by [[Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=79-81}} On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]], arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on [[states' rights]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=81-83}} After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate and instead sought election to the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=76-78}} He won election unopposed in late 1810.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=30}}\n\n==Speaker of the House==\n[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|upright=.90|Portrait by [[Matthew Harris Jouett]], 1818]]\n\n===Election and leadership===\n\nThe [[1810 and 1811 United States House of Representatives elections|1810-11 elections]] produced many young, anti-British members of Congress who, like Clay, supported going to war with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].

Partly due to Clay's hard-line stance, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=35\u201336}} After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to [[London]], where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=117}}\n\nClay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives.

At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a [[congressional nominating caucus]] to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War [[William H. Crawford|William Crawford]] emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination. Clay had a favorable opinion of both individuals, but he supported Monroe, who won the nomination and went on to defeat Federalist candidate [[Rufus King]] in the general election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=126-130}} Monroe offered Clay the position of secretary of war, but Clay strongly desired the office of secretary of state, and was angered when Monroe instead chose John Quincy Adams for that position.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=40\u201341}} Clay became so bitter that he refused to allow Monroe's inauguration to take place in the House Chamber, and subsequently did not attend Monroe's outdoor inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nIn early 1819, a dispute erupted over the proposed statehood of [[Missouri]] after New York Congressman [[James Tallmadge, Jr.|James Tallmadge]] introduced a [[Tallmadge Amendment|legislative amendment]] that would provide for the gradual emancipation of Missouri's slaves.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=44\u201345}} Though Clay had previously called for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he sided with the Southerners in voting down Tallmadge's amendment.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=143-144}} Clay instead supported Illinois Senator [[Jesse B.

Despite protests from Secretary of War Calhoun, Monroe and Adams decided to support Jackson's actions in the hope that they would convince Spain to sell Florida.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=137-138}} Clay, however, was outraged, and he publicly condemned Jackson's decision to hang two foreign nationals without a trial. Before the House chamber, he compared Jackson to military dictators of the past, telling his colleagues \"that Greece had her [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] her [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], England her [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], France her Bonaparte, and, that if we would escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} Jackson saw Clay's protestations as an attack on his character, and thus began a long rivalry between Clay and Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} The rivalry and the controversy over Jackson's expedition temporarily subsided after the signing of the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], in which the U.S. purchased Florida and delineated its western boundary with [[New Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=143}}\n\n====1824 presidential election====\n{{main|1824 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:House Election of 1825.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clay helped Adams win the 1825 contingent House election after Clay failed to finish among the three electoral vote-winners.

Clay's compromise tariff won the backing of both manufacturers, who believed they would not receive a better deal, and Calhoun, who sought a way out of the crisis but refused to work with President Jackson's supporters on an alternative tariff bill.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=217\u2013218}} Though most members of Clay's own National Republican Party opposed it, the [[Tariff of 1833]] passed both houses of Congress. Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=249\u2013254}} Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of [[Thurlow Weed]] and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=257\u2013258}} Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator [[John Tyler]], a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=309-310}} Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=311-312}} With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the [[1840 United States elections|1840 elections]], Clay saw the upcoming [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=261\u2013263}}\n\n===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845===\n{{See also|Presidency of William Henry Harrison|Presidency of John Tyler}}\n\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=195\u2013196}} Clay's will freed all the slaves he held at the time of his death.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n\n\nClay's Whig Party collapsed shortly after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Mississippi Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] stated his opinion that \"had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860-'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war\".{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=761\u2013762}}<ref name=\"king1\">{{cite magazine|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=The Day Henry Clay Refused to Compromise|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-day-henry-clay-refused-to-compromise-153589853/?no-ist|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Smithsonian|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> Clay's protege and fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden, attempted to keep the Union together with the formation of the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]]. Though Crittenden's efforts were unsuccessful, [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky remained in the Union]] during the Civil War, reflecting in part Clay's continuing influence.{{sfn|Klotter|2012|pp=243\u2013263}} [[Abraham Lincoln]] was a great admirer of Clay, saying he was \"my ideal of a great man.\" Lincoln wholeheartedly supported Clay's economic programs and, prior to the Civil War, held similar views about slavery and the Union.{{sfn|Bowman|2008|pp=495\u2013512}} Some historians have argued that a Clay victory in the 1844 election would have prevented both the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=379}}\n\nClay is generally regarded as one of the important political figures of his era.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Singletary |first1=Otis |title=\u2018Henry Clay Statesman for the Union\u2019 by Robert V.

He was the seventh [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] and the ninth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]]. He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections. He also helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull.

The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory.

In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of [[internal improvements]], which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the [[United States Senate]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn|When elected by the legislature, Clay was below the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|constitutionally required age of thirty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref> It is unclear whether the state legislature or Clay himself knew that he did not meet the Senate's age requirement at the time, though he did know of the issue later in his career.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=26}} Such an age qualification issue [[United States Senate#Qualifications|has occurred with only three other U.S. Senators]]: [[Armistead Thomson Mason]], [[John Jordan Crittenden]], and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]].}} During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including [[Chesapeake & Delaware Canal|a canal connecting]] the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=64-67}}\n\nAfter Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|speaker]] of the state house of representatives.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=10\u201310}} That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], President Jefferson arranged passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]].

During the war, Clay frequently communicated with Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] and Secretary of War [[William Eustis]], though he advocated for the replacement of the latter.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=99-101}} The war started poorly for the Americans, and Clay lost friends and relatives in the fighting.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} In October 1813, the British asked Madison to begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team, as the president hoped that the presence of the leading War Hawk would ensure support for an Anglo-American peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress, but felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=107-108}}\n\nClay left the country on February 25, but negotiations with the British did not begin until August 1814.

Partly due to Clay's hard-line stance, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=35\u201336}} After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to [[London]], where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=117}}\n\nClay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives.

With the help of [[John C.

At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a [[congressional nominating caucus]] to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War [[William H. Crawford|William Crawford]] emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination.

Despite protests from Secretary of War Calhoun, Monroe and Adams decided to support Jackson's actions in the hope that they would convince Spain to sell Florida.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=137-138}} Clay, however, was outraged, and he publicly condemned Jackson's decision to hang two foreign nationals without a trial. Before the House chamber, he compared Jackson to military dictators of the past, telling his colleagues \"that Greece had her [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] her [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], England her [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], France her Bonaparte, and, that if we would escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} Jackson saw Clay's protestations as an attack on his character, and thus began a long rivalry between Clay and Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} The rivalry and the controversy over Jackson's expedition temporarily subsided after the signing of the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], in which the U.S. purchased Florida and delineated its western boundary with [[New Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=143}}\n\n====1824 presidential election====\n{{main|1824 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:House Election of 1825.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clay helped Adams win the 1825 contingent House election after Clay failed to finish among the three electoral vote-winners.

Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

Crittenden, was Taylor's de facto campaign manager.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=340\u2013342}} Clay had initially told his allies that he would not run in the 1848 presidential election, but he was unwilling to support Taylor, a \"mere military man.\" On April 10, 1848, he announced his candidacy for the Whig nomination.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=342\u2013345}} Although Webster and Winfield Scott each commanded a limited base of support in the party, Taylor and Clay each saw the other as their lone serious rival for the Whig nomination.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=345\u2013346}} As Taylor commanded the support of most Southern Whigs, Clay focused his efforts on courting Northern Whigs, emphasizing his opposition to the Mexican\u2013American War and his life-long support for the gradual emancipation of slaves in Kentucky.{{sfn|Holt|1999|p=279}} Clay presented a strong challenge to Taylor at the [[1848 Whig National Convention]], but Taylor won the presidential nomination on the fourth ballot. Partially in an attempt to please the Clay wing of the party, the convention nominated [[Millard Fillmore]] as Taylor's running mate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=441-442}} Clay was embittered by his failure at the convention, and he did not campaign on behalf of Taylor. Nonetheless, Taylor won the election, taking 47.3 percent of the popular vote and 163 of 290 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=443-444}}\n\n===Taylor and Fillmore administrations, 1849\u20131852===\n{{see also|Presidency of Zachary Taylor|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 352\n| image1 = United States 1849-1850.png\n| caption1 = {{center|The United States after the ratification of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], with the [[Mexican Cession]] still unorganized}}\n| image2 = United States 1850-1853-03.png\n| caption2 = {{center|The United States after the Compromise of 1850}}\n}}\n\nIncreasingly worried about the sectional tensions arising over the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories, Clay accepted election to the Senate in 1849.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=444, 454}} Having refused to campaign for Taylor, Clay played little role in the formation of Taylor's Cabinet or in determining the new administration's policies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=460}} In January 1850, with Congress still deadlocked regarding the status of the Mexican Cession, Clay proposed a compromise designed to organize territory acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War and address other issues contributing to sectional tensions.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=461\u2013462}} His legislative package included the admission of [[California]] as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent [[Fugitive slave laws|fugitive slave law]].{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=111\u2013112}} Though it faced opposition from Southern extremists like Calhoun and Northern abolitionists like [[William Seward]], Clay's proposal won the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=112\u2013119}} \n\nPresident Taylor, who favored the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states without any attached conditions, opposed the plan, and Clay openly broke with the president in May 1850.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=359, 364\u2013365}} Debate over Clay's proposal continued into July, when Taylor unexpectedly died of an illness.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013366}} After Taylor's death, President Fillmore, who supported Clay's compromise bill, consulted with Clay in appointing a new Cabinet.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=465}} Exhausted by the debate in the Senate, Clay took a leave of absence shortly after Taylor's death, but Fillmore, Webster, and Democratic Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took charge of pro-compromise forces. By the end of September 1850, Clay's proposal, which became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]], had been enacted. Though contemporaries credited Fillmore, Douglas, and Webster for their role in passing the Compromise of 1850, Clay was widely regarded as the key figure in ending a major sectional crisis.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013367}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Henry Clay monument.jpg|thumb|Henry Clay monument and mausoleum, Lexington Cemetery]]\n\nIn December 1851, with his health declining, Clay announced that he would resign from the Senate the following September.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}} On June 29, 1852, Clay died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the age of 75 in his room at the [[National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|National Hotel]].<ref>John DeFerrari.

Crosby: An Autobiography'' ([[Peabody, Massachusetts]]: Hendrickson Publishers Marketing, 2013 printing), p. 87, {{ISBN|978-1-59856-281-1}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Ideology and slavery==\n===American System===\n{{main|American System (economic plan)}}\n\nThroughout most of his political life, Clay promoted his American System as both an economic program and a means for unifying the country. Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=195\u2013196}} Clay's will freed all the slaves he held at the time of his death.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n\n\nClay's Whig Party collapsed shortly after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Mississippi Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] stated his opinion that \"had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860-'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war\".{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=761\u2013762}}<ref name=\"king1\">{{cite magazine|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=The Day Henry Clay Refused to Compromise|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-day-henry-clay-refused-to-compromise-153589853/?no-ist|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Smithsonian|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> Clay's protege and fellow Kentuckian, John J.

He served two terms as [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Minister of Religion and Public Instruction]], one term as [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Minister of Agriculture]], and another one as [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Interior Minister]] before [[World War I]]. His career peaked in 1918, when he was [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].\n\nA young lawyer who supported political reform, Arion moved progressively to the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and, ca. 1885, became involved with the political club ''[[Junimea]]''. As a Conservative policymaker and disciple of [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], he rewrote legislation on [[Education in Romania|education reform]] and brought the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] under the control of its high clergy. Like Marghiloman, Arion supported the [[Central Powers]] during most of World War I, a position which seemed to carry most weight during the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|1918 armistice]]. His participation in the Marghiloman government recovered for Romania the region of [[Bessarabia]], but the subsequent return of [[Allies of World War I|Ententist]] forces made him a political suspect. He spent the remainder of his life as a marginal.\n\nIn addition to his presence in political life, Arion was an art patron, university professor, and philanthropist. He was the brother of [[Virgil Arion]], and the father of [[Dinu C. Arion]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nThe Arions were an old [[Wallachia]]n family, first attested in [[Br\u0103ila]] ca. 1696, and integrated into the [[boyar]] aristocracy in the mid-18th century.<ref>Filitti (I), p.9</ref> Its reputation was stained by two members: Constantin Eracle Arion and [[Anton I. Arion]], who had committed massive [[bank fraud]] throughout the early 1870s.<ref>Filitti (I), p.10</ref>\n\nConstantin (born in [[Bucharest]] on June 18, 1855) and Virgil C. Arion were the sons of Appellate Judge Constantin Arion and Sevasti\u021ba, n\u00e9e Url\u0103\u021beanu.<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167\">Gheorghe & \u0218erbu, p.167</ref> Constantin C. followed in his father's footsteps, graduating in Law from the [[University of Paris]] ([[Doctor of law|Doctorate]] in 1876) and in Political Science from [[Sciences Po]].<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167\"/> Upon his return to Romania, he was made Cabinet Secretary of Foreign Minister [[Vasile Boerescu]], then head of Political Affairs, but left in 1881 to set up legal practice.<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167\"/>\n\nTwo years later, he was also employed by the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Law, where he lectured in [[Commercial law|business]] and [[admiralty law]]. He received [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] in 1913,<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167, 168\">Gheorghe & \u0218erbu, pp.167, 168</ref> and became editor of the academic journal, ''Revista Critic\u0103 de Drept, Legisla\u021bie \u0219i Jurispruden\u021b\u0103'' (\"Critical Review of Law, Legislation and Jurisprudence\").<ref>Boia, p.163</ref> Virgil had a similar career in law and academia, while a third brother, Scarlat Arion, was a landowner and a Romanian consul in [[Bitola]].<ref>Filitti (II), pp.10\u201311</ref>\n\nC. C.

C. Arion had become jaded with the ideals of liberalism, and was hostile toward National Liberal [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]], [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]. During 1886, Arion, [[Take Ionescu]] and [[Nicolae Fleva]] were the main \"United Opposition\" agitators who tried to seal a pact with the ''[[Junimea]]'' conservatives, in an effort to topple the National Liberals.<ref>Gheorghe & \u0218erbu, p.124, 167, 171</ref> He first attended ''Junimea'' club meetings around 1885, when he met and befriended the ''Junimist'' leader, [[Titu Maiorescu]].

From 1896, he was president of the national school and public libraries board (''Casa \u015ecoalelor''), where he employed the services of poet [[George Co\u0219buc]].<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167\"/> His legal expertise was demanded in Romania v. Nicolae Georgescu, a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' for [[honor crime]] in Romania.

Haret had favored the [[Clerical marriage|married clergy]] over the elitist [[Romanian Synod]], creating a [[wikt:consistory|Consistory]] to represent both sides. Arion reversed that reform, and unwittingly prolonged the conflict well into the 20th century.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Paul Brusanowski, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2006/pdf/numarul1/p3-24.pdf \"Biserica \u0219i constitu\u021bionalismul.

From 1896, he was president of the national school and public libraries board (''Casa \u015ecoalelor''), where he employed the services of poet [[George Co\u0219buc]].<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167\"/> His legal expertise was demanded in Romania v. Nicolae Georgescu, a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' for [[honor crime]] in Romania. Arion represented the civil party, Aurelia Stelorian, whom Georgescu had [[Acid throwing|vitriolaged]]; his adversary in court was another famous lawyer, [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]].<ref>\"Informa\u021bi\u012d. Atentatul de la \u0219osea\", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', October 2, 1896</ref> Arion and Delavrancea both were celebrity guests at the Bucharest lecture tour of [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]], the French mystic and novelist (1898).<ref>[[Paul Cernat]], ''Avangarda rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 \u0219i complexul periferiei: primul val'', [[Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]], Bucharest, 2007, pp.42\u201343. {{ISBN|978-973-23-1911-6}}</ref>\n\n===Conservative politico===\nReturning to public life as a \"constitutionalist\" conservative, Arion joined ''Junimea'' and served as Minister of Religion and Public Instruction under Premier [[Petre P. Carp]]. His efforts centered on bringing the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] under government control, with the purpose of regulating [[Religious education in Romania|religious education]].<ref>Gheorghe & \u0218erbu, pp.167\u2013168</ref> He oversaw the collecting and publishing historical documents, edited by [[Nicolae Iorga]].<ref name=\"gfilii9\">Filitti (II), p.9</ref>\n\nArion made significant efforts to reverse the policies adopted by [[Spiru Haret]], his National Liberal predecessor. He sacked Haret's favorites and replaced them with ''Junimea'' men, but also introduced legislation which made bureaucratic office incompatible with a teaching position.<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219168\">Gheorghe & \u0218erbu, p.168</ref> The two politicians also differed in matters of church policies. Haret had favored the [[Clerical marriage|married clergy]] over the elitist [[Romanian Synod]], creating a [[wikt:consistory|Consistory]] to represent both sides. Arion reversed that reform, and unwittingly prolonged the conflict well into the 20th century.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Paul Brusanowski, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2006/pdf/numarul1/p3-24.pdf \"Biserica \u0219i constitu\u021bionalismul.

He was still active with the constitutionalist ''Junimists'', worked as editorial adviser for their magazine, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', and, in 1907, followed them into their merger with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative Party]].<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167, 168\"/> Answering Maiorescu's call, Arion and Delavrancea became political journalists for the main Conservative-''Junimist'' daily, ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''.<ref>Ornea, p.122</ref> By also appointing Arion at ''Convorbiri Literare'', Maiorescu was reaffirming his directorial role. Arion and other new staff members were supposed to undermine the editorial policies of [[Ioan Bogdan]] and [[Mihail Dragomirescu]]. Maiorescu dismissed Bogdan's previous management as a triumph of ''m\u00e2rl\u0103nie'' (\"churliness\"), and hoped to reverse the trend.<ref>Ornea, p.129\u2013130</ref>\n\nThis period saw Arion networking and organizing political cabals. He personally intervened to ensure the full-time employment of aspiring jurists, including [[Paul Negulescu]] and his own nephew, Ion Peretz.<ref name=\"gfilii9\"/> He met and befriended [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the ''Junimist'' political satirist. Together with Caragiale and Delavrancea, Arion could be seen dining at the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] restaurant owned by [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref name=\"c\u0163\u015fase1OOii\"/> From 1909, Arion was also active as a philanthropist, serving on the board of [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth]]'s charitable society, and as honorary president of the Romanian Artists' Society.<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219167, 168\"/>\n\n[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - In redactia revistei.jpg|thumb|320px|Arion (seated at center) and Romanian journalists.

He preserved this position after Carp was replaced with Maiorescu, while also serving as head of Internal Affairs and [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture and Royal Domains]]. It fell on Arion to adopt the [[Land reform in Romania|set of agricultural reforms]] that National Liberal politicians had been postponing ever since the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|Peasants' Revolt of 1907]].<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219168\"/> At Public Instruction, he also granted religious and educational privileges to the [[Albanians in Romania|Albanian-Romanian community]].<ref name=\"gfilii9\"/> During the interval, he was elected honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]].<ref name=\"cgh&m\u0219168\"/>\n\nArion's mandate witnessed another outbreak of civic disobedience, this time centered on the public cult of liberal symbols, including images of ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexander John Cuza]]. In order to avoid a showdown between the Conservatives and the National Liberals, Arion agreed to inaugurate the Cuza monument of [[Ia\u0219i]].<ref name=\"amihg\u00eelceav\u0103\">{{in lang|ro}} Andi Mihalache, [http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/gilceava-politica-in-jurul-statuii-lui-cuza~ni4kdm \"G\u00eelceav\u0103 politic\u0103 \u00een jurul statuii lui Cuza\"], in ''[[Ziarul de Ia\u0219i]]'', January 24, 2008</ref> At the time, Arion also made public his approval of Romanian [[irredentism]], in respect to [[Bessarabia]] region (taken by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1812). He gave his approval to commemorative marches, and engaged in a publicized row with anti-irredentist Conservatives, such as Mayor [[Dimitrie Greceanu]].<ref name=\"amihg\u00eelceav\u0103\"/>\n\nArion slowly aligned his educational policies with Haret's principles. The \"Arion Law\", adopted by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] in 1912, established clear criteria for the promotion of teachers and academics, ensuring greater [[professionalization]]: teaching positions were granted on the basis of a solid scientific reputation in the respective field of expertise.

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese.

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese.  Each municipality is further divided into one or more [[parish]]es which each contain one or more congregations. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Deanery (''Prosti'') !!
