The film tells the story of 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), a recent college graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson ([[Anne Bancroft]]), and then falls in love with her daughter Elaine ([[Katharine Ross]]).\n\nThe film was released on December 22, 1967, received positive reviews and grossed $104.9{{nbsp}}million in the U.S. and Canada.

In 1996, ''The Graduate'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Initially, the film was placed at No.7 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list in 1998. When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|revised the list in 2007]], the film was moved to No.17.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 20, has earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from a college on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and has returned home to a party celebrating his [[graduation]] at his parents' house in [[Pasadena, California]]. Benjamin has no idea of what to do with his life and is visibly unhappy as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. He hides from those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is persuaded inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see Elaine's portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin rejects her but a few days later, he awkwardly organizes a meeting at the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym Gladstone.\n\nBenjamin spends the rest of the summer relaxing around the pool by day, refusing to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids him.\n\nBenjamin decides to take Elaine on a date in order to  ruin it: he ignores her, drives dangerously, and takes her to a strip club. After she runs out of the club in tears, he changes his mind, apologizes for his behavior, and discovers that Elaine is someone he is happy to be around. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that he has been having an affair with a married woman. She accepts his acknowledgement that the affair is over, but an angry Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair. To prevent this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.\n\nElaine is disgusted and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there and tries to charm her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he [[rape]]d her while she was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin.\n\nAfter [[stalking]] her for several days and continuously proposing to her, Benjamin begins to make amends with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had a relationship.\n\nReturning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burglarized.\n\nBenjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams \"Elaine!\" frantically. After hesitating, Elaine screams \"Ben!\" and looks at him pitifully. He rushes toward her, and a fight ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by picking up a large cross and wielding it, then jamming the church doors shut with it. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat, [[Elopement|eloping]].\n\nHowever, as they settle into their seats, their faces change from happiness to uncertainty as \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nNichols' first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]].<ref>The audio commentary by Mike Nichols and Steven Soderbergh in Criterion Collection BD and DVD.</ref> The idea behind this was that in the French culture, the \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters (it is a cliche). There were numerous actors considered or tested for, or who wanted, roles in the film. [[Doris Day]] turned down an offer because the nudity required by the role offended her.<ref name=mcgee>{{cite book| title=Doris Day: Sentimental Journey| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfbcA3zFlNgC&pg=PT326&dq=doris+day+graduate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y-8UU9-RNOfN0wHi5IHQAg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=graduate&f=false| last=McGee| first=Garry| date=November 22, 2011| page=160| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0-7864-6107-3| accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] inquired as to play the part, while [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] both wanted the role. [[Patricia Neal]] turned down the film as she had recently recovered from a stroke and did not feel ready to accept such a major role. [[Geraldine Page]] also turned it down. Other actors considered for the part included [[Claire Bloom]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Eleanor Parker]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Angela Lansbury]] also asked about playing the part. [[Ava Gardner]] sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nWhen [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111#v=onepage&f=true| title=The Graduate| work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| accessdate=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

Beatty turned the film down as he was occupied with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. Redford tested for the part of Benjamin (with [[Candice Bergen]] as Elaine), but Nichols thought Redford did not possess the underdog quality Benjamin needed.<ref name=kashner>{{cite magazine | title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of ''The Graduate'' | url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/graduate200803 | last=Kashner| first=Sam | work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=March 2008 | accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the role of Mr. Robinson, [[Gene Hackman]] was originally cast, but just before filming began, the director decided he was too young and decided to replace him. [[Marlon Brando]], [[Howard Duff]], [[Brian Keith]], [[George Peppard]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Gregory Peck]] were all other choices for the role that [[Murray Hamilton]] eventually played. [[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. And to play Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) all came close to getting the role that ended up going to [[William Daniels]].<ref name=kashner />\n\n===Filming locations===\nMany of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of [[University of Southern California|USC]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USCfilming>{{cite web |title=USC's Lists & Urban Legends: Just a Few of the Feature Films Shot on the University Park Campus |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |last=Moore |first=Annette |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |date=Spring 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527071350/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe church used for the wedding scene is actually the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[La Verne, California|La Verne]]. In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film ''[[Girl Shy]]'' starring [[Harold Lloyd]], who also served as an advisor for the scene in ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1443795|title=Silent Salon 2015 // Girl Shy|publisher=brownpapertickets.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctormacro.com/Movie%20Summaries/G/Girl%20Shy.htm|title=Girl Shy|publisher=doctormacro.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Graduate (soundtrack)}}\nThe film boosted the profile of [[folk-rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. Originally, Nichols and O'Steen used their existing songs like \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" merely as a pacing device for the editing until Nichols decided that substituting original music would not be effective and decided to include them on the soundtrack, an unusual move at that time.<ref name=harris>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=Pictures at a Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/360 |date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=The Penguin Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/360 360\u20131] |isbn=978-1-5942-0152-3 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nAccording to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article by [[Peter Bart]] in the May 15, 2005, issue, [[Lawrence Turman]], his producer, then made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for the movie. By the time they had nearly finished editing the film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more, but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he did not have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; \"It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past\u2014about [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Mrs. Roosevelt]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] and stuff.\" Nichols advised Simon, \"It's now about [[Mrs. Robinson]], not Mrs. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=bart>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/the-perfect-pic-alignment-1117922805/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Peter |last=Bart |author-link=Peter Bart |title=The perfect pic alignment |date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Graduate'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.

In 1996, ''The Graduate'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Initially, the film was placed at No.7 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list in 1998. When [[American Film Institute|AFI]] [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|revised the list in 2007]], the film was moved to No.17.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 20, has earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from a college on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and has returned home to a party celebrating his [[graduation]] at his parents' house in [[Pasadena, California]]. Benjamin has no idea of what to do with his life and is visibly unhappy as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. He hides from those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is persuaded inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see Elaine's portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin rejects her but a few days later, he awkwardly organizes a meeting at the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym Gladstone.\n\nBenjamin spends the rest of the summer relaxing around the pool by day, refusing to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids him.\n\nBenjamin decides to take Elaine on a date in order to  ruin it: he ignores her, drives dangerously, and takes her to a strip club. After she runs out of the club in tears, he changes his mind, apologizes for his behavior, and discovers that Elaine is someone he is happy to be around. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that he has been having an affair with a married woman. She accepts his acknowledgement that the affair is over, but an angry Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair. To prevent this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother.\n\nElaine is disgusted and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. Benjamin follows her there and tries to charm her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he [[rape]]d her while she was [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin.\n\nAfter [[stalking]] her for several days and continuously proposing to her, Benjamin begins to make amends with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had a relationship.\n\nReturning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burglarized.\n\nBenjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams \"Elaine!\" frantically. After hesitating, Elaine screams \"Ben!\" and looks at him pitifully. He rushes toward her, and a fight ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by picking up a large cross and wielding it, then jamming the church doors shut with it. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat, [[Elopement|eloping]].\n\nHowever, as they settle into their seats, their faces change from happiness to uncertainty as \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" plays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nNichols' first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress [[Jeanne Moreau]].<ref>The audio commentary by Mike Nichols and Steven Soderbergh in Criterion Collection BD and DVD.</ref> The idea behind this was that in the French culture, the \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters (it is a cliche).

I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nWhen [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111#v=onepage&f=true| title=The Graduate| work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| accessdate=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

[[Marlon Brando]], [[Howard Duff]], [[Brian Keith]], [[George Peppard]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Gregory Peck]] were all other choices for the role that [[Murray Hamilton]] eventually played. [[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. And to play Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) all came close to getting the role that ended up going to [[William Daniels]].<ref name=kashner />\n\n===Filming locations===\nMany of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of [[University of Southern California|USC]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USCfilming>{{cite web |title=USC's Lists & Urban Legends: Just a Few of the Feature Films Shot on the University Park Campus |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |last=Moore |first=Annette |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |date=Spring 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527071350/http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/spring06/Lists.html |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe church used for the wedding scene is actually the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[La Verne, California|La Verne]]. In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film ''[[Girl Shy]]'' starring [[Harold Lloyd]], who also served as an advisor for the scene in ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1443795|title=Silent Salon 2015 // Girl Shy|publisher=brownpapertickets.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctormacro.com/Movie%20Summaries/G/Girl%20Shy.htm|title=Girl Shy|publisher=doctormacro.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Graduate (soundtrack)}}\nThe film boosted the profile of [[folk-rock]] duo [[Simon & Garfunkel]].

He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; \"It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past\u2014about [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Mrs. Roosevelt]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] and stuff.\" Nichols advised Simon, \"It's now about [[Mrs. Robinson]], not Mrs. Roosevelt.\"<ref name=bart>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/the-perfect-pic-alignment-1117922805/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Peter |last=Bart |author-link=Peter Bart |title=The perfect pic alignment |date=May 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Graduate'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.

For the film's thirtieth anniversary reissue, Ebert retracted some of his previous praise for the film, noting that he felt its time had passed and that he now had more sympathy for Mrs. Robinson than Benjamin (whom he considered \"an insufferable creep\"), viewing one's sympathy for Mrs. Robinson and disdainful attitude toward Ben as a function of aging and wisdom.<ref name=\"ebert30\">{{cite news |title=The Graduate |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970328/REVIEWS/703280304/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 28, 1997 |accessdate=2011-04-13}}</ref> He, along with [[Gene Siskel]], gave the film a positive if unenthusiastic review on the television program ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel & Ebert]]''.<ref name=siskel>{{cite episode |series=Siskel & Ebert at the Movies |url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/2XNKBRRX1HXR/LiarLiar--Crash--Selena--The-Graduate-1997 |airdate=March 22, 1997 |season=11 |number=28 |publisher=Siskel&Ebert.org |title=LiarLiar / Crash / Selena / The Graduate (1997) |minutes=3:40 |transcript=TV.com: Siskel & Ebert at the Movies Season 11 Episode 28 |transcripturl=http://www.tv.com/shows/siskel-and-ebert-at-the-movies/week-of-march-22-1997-1226197/ |accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref> Furthermore, the film's rating in the AFI list of the greatest American films fell from seventh in 1997 to seventeenth in the 2007 update.

The ride opened in 1972.]]\nWhen the park opened, there were 500 employees and 33 attractions, many of which were designed and built by [[Arrow Dynamics|Arrow Development Co.]] which designed and built many of the original attractions at Disneyland. The admission price in 1971 was $5 for adults, and $3.50 for children between the ages of 3 and 12. Because the park was in a relatively remote part of Los Angeles County, the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus line]] provided bus service to and from the park and Los Angeles, as well as from Northern California, and optionally allowed purchase of park admission at the time the bus ticket was purchased.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.paul-robinson.us/index.php/2012/01/09/rtd?blog=6 | title = Remembering RTD and the \"good old days\" of cheap LA area public transit | date = January 9, 2012 | first = Paul | last = Robinson | work = Stories, Parables, and Long Items | access-date = February 4, 2013 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129075956/http://www.paul-robinson.us/index.php/2012/01/09/rtd?blog=6 | archive-date = November 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt its 1971 opening, the rides and attractions included [[Gold Rusher]], a steel coaster; the [[Log Jammer (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Log Jammer]], a log flume; the Sky Tower, an [[observation tower]]; Grand Prix, similar to Disneyland's Autopia ride; El Bumpo, bumper boats; a [[Carousel]]; and other smaller rides. There were four transportation rides to the peak: Funicular, a [[cable railway]] or [[funicular]], later renamed '''Orient Express'''; the Metro, which consist three monorail stations around the park: Whitewater Lake, Country Fair, and Mountain stations; and \"Eagles Flight\", a skyride that combined two stations at the peak: the long one north to Galaxy Station, and the short one west to El Dorado Station.  The Showcase Theater (renamed Golden Bear Theater), was part of the original park and featured [[Barbra Streisand]] as the first of many headline performers who would appear at Magic Mountain over the years.\n\nIn the 1971 season, Magic Mountain obtained permission from [[Warner Bros.]] to use [[Looney Tunes]] characters. However, they did not continue using the characters after their first year. In 1972, they began using trolls as the park mascots. The trolls King Blop, also known as King Troll, Bleep, Bloop, and the Wizard became recognizable symbols of Magic Mountain. All King Productions, a contractor, provided the entertainers wearing the costumes until December 31, 1972, when Magic Mountain took on that role. The characters were used until 1985. Also in 1972, a second flume ride named [[Jet Stream (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Jet Stream]] was added.\n\nIn 1973 the park added its second roller coaster, the Mountain Express, a compact [[Anton Schwarzkopf|Schwarzkopf]] Wildcat model steel coaster.  In 1974 the park also installed a new complex of spinning rides in what would later be known as Back Street. The new additions consisted of the Himalaya, Electric Rainbow, and Tumble Drum. In 1975, the Grand Centennial Railway opened in the Back Street. It took riders on a train journey to Spillikin Corners and back.\n\n===The Coaster Revolution===\n[[File:SFMM- Roaring Rapids 2.JPG|thumb|Roaring Rapids is a river rafting water ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain.]]\nWith the opening of [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] in 1976, Magic Mountain became the first park in the world to have a modern, 360-degree steel looping coaster (though previous roller coasters with loops had been built and dismantled elsewhere due to safety issues). When it was built, there was very little in the way of surrounding brush. Now, the tracks are surrounded by trees and bushes, which prevents the riders from knowing the track layout beforehand. [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] then filmed a major movie at Magic Mountain with the Revolution as its centerpiece called [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] in 1977. \n[[File:SFMM- Colossus 2.JPG|thumb|Colossus was a wooden roller coaster which opened in 1978.]]\nIn 1978, [[Colossus (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Colossus]], at the time the fastest, largest dual-tracked wooden coaster, opened. Following its first season, it was closed and extensively redone. When it reopened, it was a much smoother ride. In 1991, the camel hump before the last, or third, turn was replaced by a block brake. Though it decreased the speed of the ride after this particular brake, it did allow three trains to run per side at a time, greatly increasing capacity. One of the trains sometimes ran backwards for a few years in the mid-80s. However, until the late 1990s this kind of ride was no longer possible due to the newer ride system in place, as well as different trains. During ''Fright Fest'', the park runs one side backwards using a set of trains acquired from the now demolished [[Psyclone (roller coaster)|Psyclone]] which was located on the other side of the park. In 2015, the coaster was re-tracked with steel tracking and several inversions were added to the coaster. It was subsequently rebranded \"[[Twisted Colossus]]\". This renovation was completed by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]].\n\n===Six Flags era===\n[[File:Goliath drop.JPG|thumb|left|The opening drop on [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]]. Goliath featured the longest drop on a closed circuit roller coaster when it opened in February 2000.]]\nIn 1979, the park was sold to Six Flags and became known as Six Flags Magic Mountain. In 1981, Six Flags Magic Mountain introduced a ride that was on the west coast for the first time called [[Roaring Rapids]]. It was developed by [[Intamin]] in conjunction with the now defunct [[Six Flags Astroworld]], which had opened a similar ride in 1979. Along with Rapids came the completion of the midway near Spillikin Corners to link with Revolution's area. Finally, a complete circuit could be made around the park. It was originally designed as a dual-sided station, but only one was fully developed, and all that exists of the possible second side is a few supports. It uses large pumps to circulate water, and each of the two pumps can circulate 88,500 gallons per minute. The reservoir can hold 1.5 million gallons of water, and one of the innovations used on it was the introduction of guide boards to help eliminate jam ups.\n\nIn 1982, the attraction [[Freefall (ride)|Freefall]] was added. Also built by [[Intamin]], it was considered a cutting edge drop tower ride, if not strictly a \"roller coaster.\" It simply ascends the tower and then drops down, with the track curving to horizontal, leaving riders on their backs. Others were built for other parks (some of which are Six Flags). Today, most of these rides are obsolete and have been removed. Some flat rides were added and others removed the next year.\n\nIn 1984, [[Sarajevo Bobsleds]] was erected. Yet another ride built by [[Intamin]], the coaster was basically a bobsled without ice and snow. The coaster was built in honor of the [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Olympics]]. [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] added a similar ride that same year. In 1986, [[Sarajevo Bobsleds]] was removed and now operates at [[Six Flags Over Texas]] as [[La Vibora]]. The other bobsled was moved to [[Six Flags Great America]] and later to [[The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom|The Great Escape]] in [[Queensbury, New York]], where it operates as [[Alpine Bobsled]].\n\nIn 1985, Children's World was rethemed as [[Bugs Bunny]] World, as Magic Mountain had abandoned the Trolls in favor of the Warner Brothers' characters. That year, [[Michael Jackson]] visited the park, riding rides such as Colossus, Revolution and Roaring Rapids. In 1986, the park added a steel stand-up looping roller coaster called [[Batman The Escape|Shockwave]] designed by Intamin. This coaster was located in the back of the park replacing Sarajevo Bobsleds. At the end of 1988, the coaster was removed as part of a ride rotation program and went to Six Flags Great Adventure in 1990. It was removed from there in 1992 and was repainted white and rethemed upon its removal to [[Six Flags Astroworld]]. There it was known as Batman The Escape. When Astroworld closed in 2005, the ride was put in storage at [[Darien Lake]].\n\nIn 1987, the park re-themed the Back Street. Spinning flat rides were renamed Turbo (Electric Rainbow), Subway (Himalaya), and Reactor (Enterprise). The dance club was rethemed as well, and located near Reactor. After Hours, as it was now called (formerly Decibels), for one summer stayed open later than the rest of the park. It, along with Back Street, would stay open an additional two hours as a place for locals to hang out. This format lasted one season.\n\nIn 1988 [[Ninja (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Ninja]], \"The Black Belt of Roller Coasters\", opened. Built by [[Arrow Dynamics]], it was the first [[suspended swing roller coaster]] on the West coast. Ninja has gone through very few changes since it was opened in 1988; evidently only the wheels and paint have been changed.\n[[File:SFMM- Tidal Wave 1.JPG|thumb|[[Tidal Wave (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Tidal Wave]] is a Shoot the Chute water ride, featuring a {{Convert|50|ft|adj=on}} splashdown into a large body of water.]]\n[[Tidal Wave (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Tidal Wave]] opened in 1989. It is a short, wet ride featuring a large boat that travels up a low-angled incline to a level water trough. The trough, in the shape of a semicircle, ends in a steep drop into a large splashpool. The impact displaces large amounts of water on its riders. The ride's exit ramp crosses over the splashpool, allowing willing patrons leaving the ride to get soaked from the splash.\n\n[[File:Six Flags Magic Mountain Viper and X2 from Sky Tower cropped version.jpg|thumb|left|Viper, seen in the foreground, was constructed in the park in 1990]]\n\nIn 1990, [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Viper]], a multiple looping coaster designed by [[Arrow Dynamics]] opened. It features a {{convert|188|ft|m|adj=on}} drop, speeds up to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, 3 [[Inclined loop|vertical loops]], a batwing turn that inverts riders twice, and a double corkscrew.\n\nIn 1991, Magic Mountain added [[Psyclone (roller coaster)|Psyclone]], modeled after the [[Coney Island Cyclone]]. The Spillikin Corners area of the park was re-themed as Cyclone Bay to suit the new coaster, drawing guests into this area. The change was largely cosmetic, as the earlier theme relied on retail establishments that had been removed previously. The Glass Blower had been replaced by the Shooting Gallery, and the Candy Kitchen viewing area was redesigned. With Psyclone, the crowds returned. Due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Psyclone's structure was damaged, and the ride was eventually removed in 2007. After adding Ninja, Viper, and Psyclone within 4 years, the park was getting a large repertoire of big roller coasters.\n\nThe next year, 1992, a coaster built by Intamin called [[Flashback (roller coaster)|Flashback]] was added. This one-of-a-kind ride, originally planned to be enclosed in a building, had already operated at [[Six Flags Great America]] and [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] prior to its arrival. Very steep, short drops were designed to make riders feel like they were \"diving\" down in a plane, and it ended in a 540 degree upward spiral. But, because of the shoulder harnesses, riders were subjected to a lot of head banging. This coaster rarely ran by 1996 (it created too much noise for the nearby water park) and on January 23, 2007, the park announced that Flashback would be removed along with Psyclone. The park also stated that Flashback might be re-built elsewhere within the park for 2008 but the ride was finally scrapped at the end of 2008.\n\n===Time Warner era===\nIn 1993 Six Flags Magic Mountain entered the Time Warner era.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-21/business/fi-37629_1_time-warner |title=Time Warner Completes Six Flags Purchase \u2013 Los Angeles Times |newspaper=Los Angeles Times }}</ref> The new ride for the year was Yosemite Sam Sierra Falls. It was a water ride that has two twisting tubes that riders could slide down in using a raft. Also that year, there was re-theming and High Sierra Territory was opened. The Showcase Theatre became Golden Bear Theater, the Animal Star Theatre was created in Bugs Bunny World, and a large, fake, wooden tree was built. This year also saw the end of live non-Christian themed concerts in the park due to the riot that broke out as a result of a \"TLC\" concert that was oversold. Magic Mountain was quickly overwhelmed by large crowds that vandalized and destroyed property.  Park shops had their windows broken and looting quickly followed. Police were called to the scene in full riot gear. The park was evacuated and closed down for the night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-19/local/me-24654_1_magic-mountain |title=Magic Mountain Reopens After Melees \u2013 Los Angeles Times |newspaper=Los Angeles Times }}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Magic Mountain added what two other Six Flags parks already had, a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted looping roller coaster called [[Batman: The Ride]] (which other Six Flags parks also added in the coming years). Batman: the Ride (BTR) is an inverted coaster, meaning the usual coaster protocol is reversed; the track is overhead and the cars are below it. The trains travel on the outside of the loops, and rider's legs hang freely, as on a ski lift.\n\n[[File:SFMM- Sign 2.JPG|thumb|Signs to nearby rides and other attractions]]\nIn 1995, a separately gated waterpark called [[Six Flags Hurricane Harbor]] opened in June. The park included body slides, tube slides, a kiddie water play area, lazy river, and a wave pool. The following year, a [[SkyCoaster]] called Dive Devil opened at Magic Mountain.\n\nA dual launch coaster called [[Superman: Escape From Krypton|Superman: The Escape]] debuted at the park on March 15, 1997. Designed by [[Intamin]], the 30-second ride launches riders from 0 to {{Convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in seven seconds on a track that scales up a 41-story tower. It was the first roller coaster in the world to reach speeds of 100&nbsp;mph. In 2011, it received a new color scheme and was renamed \"Superman: Escape From Krypton\". In addition, the trains were reversed to provide a backward-facing launch.\n\n[[File:SFMM- Riddler's Revenge 5.JPG|thumb|The [[The Riddler's Revenge|Riddler's Revenge]] is a [[stand-up roller coaster]] which features 6 inversions.]]\nIn 1998, a new Bolliger & Mabillard [[Stand-up roller coaster]] called [[Riddler's Revenge]] opened as the tallest and fastest stand-up roller coaster in the world.\n\n===Premier Parks era===\nAlso in 1998 Six Flags was sold to Premier Parks. The next year saw no dramatic changes. In 2000, a steel [[hypercoaster]], [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]], was added. It was built by [[Giovanola]].\n\n2001 was to be the year of three new roller coasters, but only one actually opened on time: [[Goliath Jr.]], a steel kiddie coaster. The other two, [[Giant Inverted Boomerang|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]] and [[X\u00b2 (roller coaster)|X]] (now X\u00b2), had mechanical problems. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu opened late in 2001 and X opened early in 2002. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu was designed by [[Vekoma]] and is a Giant Inverted Boomerang coaster (GIB), a variant of their popular [[Boomerang (roller coaster)|Boomerang]] design. It is an inverted coaster with coaches suspended beneath an overhead track that traverses an open-circuit track forward and in reverse and features two completely vertical drops and three inversions. It opened late in 2001, but suffered a lot of downtime. X was designed by Arrow Dynamics, as the world's first \"fourth-dimensional\" roller coaster. It is the only one in North America where riders experience going 360 degrees in their seats. Each seat lies on a separate axis from the track. This coaster managed to open briefly on January 7, 2002, only to close due to more technical problems. It reopened late in August of that year. The ride closed for a major refurbishment and re-theme in 2008 where X transformed into X\u00b2.\n\nIn 2003, [[Scream (roller coaster)|Scream]], designed by Bolliger & Mabillard was added. At this point, Six Flags Magic Mountain tied with [[Cedar Point]] for the park with the most roller coasters in the United States. Scream is similar in concept with [[Medusa (Six Flags Discovery Kingdom)|Medusa]] at [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] and is a mirror image of [[Bizarro (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Bizarro]] at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]]. It is a [[floorless roller coaster]] with trains riding above the rails traversing seven inversions on {{convert|3985|ft|m}} of track on floorless trains. In 2006, [[Tatsu]], a Bolliger & Mabillard [[flying roller coaster]] was added, causing a temporary closure of Revolution to allow construction to take place. It was much larger than the other three Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coasters at other Six Flags parks, all named [[Superman: Ultimate Flight]].  Tatsu has a suspended-track orientation featuring vehicles that recline passengers with their backs against the track and facing the ground. This brought the park up to 17 roller coasters, to tie with Cedar Point for the greatest number of roller coasters in a park (albeit Flashback had been standing but not operating for an extended period of time and thus it is debatable whether the park could claim 17 as its number of roller coasters).\n\n===2006 attempted sale===\nOn June 22, 2006, Six Flags, Inc. announced that it was exploring options for six of its parks, including Magic Mountain and its neighboring water park, [[Six Flags Hurricane Harbor|Hurricane Harbor]]. Though management said closing the park was unlikely, rumors still began that the park could be sold to real estate developers, with an intent to close the park and build housing developments in the area.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher=Business Wire |date=June 22, 2006 | title=Six Flags to Explore Strategic Options for Six Properties \u2013 Buffalo, Concord, Denver, Seattle, Houston and Los Angeles; Company Provides Mid-Quarter Update on Operations | url=http://investors.sixflags.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=61629&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=875468&highlight= | accessdate=June 27, 2006}}</ref> Park officials cited dwindling attendance due to rowdy behavior among some of the park-goers (notably gang members and other teenagers and young adults, who account for a large percentage of the park's attendance{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2016}}) as reasons for wanting to sell the park while management was wanting to move Six Flags into more of a family park direction.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lance |last=Hart |url=http://www.screamscape.com/html/six_flags_magic_mountain.htm |title=Six Flags Magic Mountain |publisher=Screamscape.com |date=May 4, 2007 }}</ref> Throughout the Six Flags chain, attendance in the second quarter of 2006 was 14 percent lower than it was in the second quarter of 2005.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.the-signal.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=31912&format=html | url-status = dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224164921/http://www.the-signal.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=31912&format=html | archive-date=February 24, 2007 | title = Six Flags Posts 2Q Loss of $39.6 Mil. | first = Adam | last = Clark | date = August 3, 2006 | work = [[The Santa Clarita Valley Signal]]}}</ref>\n\nBy the fall of 2006, Six Flags announced that Magic Mountain was still up for sale. They also stated, however, that it would be sold to a company that would continue to operate it as a park, and that closing Magic Mountain was not a possibility. [[Cedar Fair]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], and several others considered buying the park but none of the offers came close to the asking price.\n\nWhen Six Flags announced which parks it was selling in January 2007, Magic Mountain was no longer one of them. The company decided not to sell Magic Mountain and its adjacent water park. Spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg said that upon further evaluation, the company decided that the Los Angeles parks remained too valuable to relinquish, as sales were increasing, and that the park would not be sold. Other parks were sold as a package and remained open.\n\n===2007\u2013present===\n[[File:SFMM Magic Flyer.jpg|thumb|Magic flyer roller coaster]]\n[[File:SFMM- Scream.jpg|thumb|Scream roller coaster]]\n[[File:Tatsu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tatsu]], one of the roller coasters at Six Flags Magic Mountain.]]\n[[File:SFMM- Twisted Colossus 2.jpg|thumb|[[Twisted Colossus]], one of Magic Mountain's most signature and iconic roller coasters.

As a result, Six Flags Magic Mountain no longer tied the record for the most roller coasters in a single park, relinquishing the record to [[Cedar Point]] \u2013 the park's total had never surpassed Cedar Point but had tied numerous times. The park began focusing more attention on marketing with family-oriented values, and a new children's theme area, [[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends|Thomas Town]], was added in 2008. The park renovated one its thrill rides, however. \"X\" was closed in late 2007 for its transformation into X<sup>2</sup> which featured new fourth-generation trains, a new paint job, and special effects that included flame throwers and audio. It reopened in 2008. In the same year, the park began work on the \"Magic of the Mountain\" museum at the top of its Sky Tower attraction that contained memorabilia throughout the park's history including old television commercials, park maps, models, and equipment saved from defunct rides.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_8412730 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304113622/http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_8412730 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2008 |title=Teen creating some magic with his Six Flags museum \u2013 LA Daily News |newspaper=Daily News |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Apocalypse: The Ride|Terminator Salvation: The Ride]], a wooden roller coaster, opened on May 23, 2009.

[[Bob Einstein]], as his character [[Super Dave Osborne]], performed his first \"stunt\" on a rollercoster at Magic Mountain. In 1983, Magic Mountain became the fictional \"Walley World\" for ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', with scenes featuring ''Revolution'' and ''Colossus'' (each using fictional names). On television, Magic Mountain doubled as the theme park in the opening credits of the television series ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]''. Other TV productions featuring Magic Mountain have included: [[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]], ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'',  ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Way Out Games]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[The King of Queens]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. The band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] also filmed their acting debut in 1978's [[made-for-TV]] ''[[Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park]]'' that featured the band members in the park and near Colossus.  In the 2000 movie ''[[Space Cowboys]]'' Donald Sutherland is shown riding Viper and is portrayed as the designer when Clint Eastwood recruits him.\n\nMagic Mountain was also the filming site for the [[Real Wheels]] video, \"Here Comes A Roller Coaster\", as well as for the ''[[Kidsongs]]'' 1990 video, \"Ride the Roller Coaster\".\n\nIn the [[Nickelodeon]] show ''[[Drake & Josh]]'', Drake, Josh, and Megan take a trip to Mystic Mountain (parody of Magic Mountain) in the episode \"The Demonator\", and they ride the \"Demonator\". On ''[[Zoey 101]]'' Zoey and Lisa take Michael to Mystic Mountain (both series were created by [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]), and they help Michael overcome his roller coaster fear in the episode \"Rollercoaster\". He rides the \"Spine Twister\", which was actually the [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]] from Magic Mountain. In 1990, Nickelodeon's ''[[Wild and Crazy Kids]]'', the wooden roller coaster,Colossus, was featured as a game called \"Wacky RollerCoaster Spill\". In the movie ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', the band performs as second billing to a puppet show at the fictional \"Themeland Amusement Park\" in [[Stockton, California]], located {{convert|300|mi|km}} north of Santa Clarita. The actual filming location is Magic Mountain's amphitheater. The [[Kidsongs]] video ''Ride the Roller Coaster'' is set at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Nick Cannon group ''[[The School Gyrls]]'' movie premiere was at Magic Mountain. In the film ''[[Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer]]'', they go to a theme park and ride a roller coaster for the first time. The coaster was Goliath. Goliath was also featured as the \"Aquaman\" roller coaster in the third season of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.\n\nIn 2011, the park was chosen as the setting for the [[Travel Channel]]'s version of the quiz show ''[[Scream! If You Know the Answer]]''. The ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' cast visited the park in 2012 for their senior skip day in the \"[[Big Brother (Glee)|Big Brother]]\" episode, where they ride [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Viper]].<ref name=\"Glee\">{{cite web|title=Six Flags Magic Mountain has a cameo appearance ...|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150799927722125&set=a.111563082124.115580.67502107124&type=1|author=Six Flags Magic Mountain|publisher=Facebook|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a large section of the parking lot was blocked off for a Toyota Camry commercial. Both pictures and the background footage reveal Goliath and Colossus, indicating that it is Magic Mountain where the commercial was shot.

The ride opened in 1972.]]\nWhen the park opened, there were 500 employees and 33 attractions, many of which were designed and built by [[Arrow Dynamics|Arrow Development Co.]] which designed and built many of the original attractions at Disneyland. The admission price in 1971 was $5 for adults, and $3.50 for children between the ages of 3 and 12. Because the park was in a relatively remote part of Los Angeles County, the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus line]] provided bus service to and from the park and Los Angeles, as well as from Northern California, and optionally allowed purchase of park admission at the time the bus ticket was purchased.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.paul-robinson.us/index.php/2012/01/09/rtd?blog=6 | title = Remembering RTD and the \"good old days\" of cheap LA area public transit | date = January 9, 2012 | first = Paul | last = Robinson | work = Stories, Parables, and Long Items | access-date = February 4, 2013 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129075956/http://www.paul-robinson.us/index.php/2012/01/09/rtd?blog=6 | archive-date = November 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt its 1971 opening, the rides and attractions included [[Gold Rusher]], a steel coaster; the [[Log Jammer (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Log Jammer]], a log flume; the Sky Tower, an [[observation tower]]; Grand Prix, similar to Disneyland's Autopia ride; El Bumpo, bumper boats; a [[Carousel]]; and other smaller rides. There were four transportation rides to the peak: Funicular, a [[cable railway]] or [[funicular]], later renamed '''Orient Express'''; the Metro, which consist three monorail stations around the park: Whitewater Lake, Country Fair, and Mountain stations; and \"Eagles Flight\", a skyride that combined two stations at the peak: the long one north to Galaxy Station, and the short one west to El Dorado Station.  The Showcase Theater (renamed Golden Bear Theater), was part of the original park and featured [[Barbra Streisand]] as the first of many headline performers who would appear at Magic Mountain over the years.\n\nIn the 1971 season, Magic Mountain obtained permission from [[Warner Bros.]] to use [[Looney Tunes]] characters. However, they did not continue using the characters after their first year. In 1972, they began using trolls as the park mascots. The trolls King Blop, also known as King Troll, Bleep, Bloop, and the Wizard became recognizable symbols of Magic Mountain. All King Productions, a contractor, provided the entertainers wearing the costumes until December 31, 1972, when Magic Mountain took on that role. The characters were used until 1985. Also in 1972, a second flume ride named [[Jet Stream (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Jet Stream]] was added.\n\nIn 1973 the park added its second roller coaster, the Mountain Express, a compact [[Anton Schwarzkopf|Schwarzkopf]] Wildcat model steel coaster.  In 1974 the park also installed a new complex of spinning rides in what would later be known as Back Street. The new additions consisted of the Himalaya, Electric Rainbow, and Tumble Drum. In 1975, the Grand Centennial Railway opened in the Back Street. It took riders on a train journey to Spillikin Corners and back.\n\n===The Coaster Revolution===\n[[File:SFMM- Roaring Rapids 2.JPG|thumb|Roaring Rapids is a river rafting water ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain.]]\nWith the opening of [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] in 1976, Magic Mountain became the first park in the world to have a modern, 360-degree steel looping coaster (though previous roller coasters with loops had been built and dismantled elsewhere due to safety issues). When it was built, there was very little in the way of surrounding brush. Now, the tracks are surrounded by trees and bushes, which prevents the riders from knowing the track layout beforehand. [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] then filmed a major movie at Magic Mountain with the Revolution as its centerpiece called [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] in 1977. \n[[File:SFMM- Colossus 2.JPG|thumb|Colossus was a wooden roller coaster which opened in 1978.]]\nIn 1978, [[Colossus (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Colossus]], at the time the fastest, largest dual-tracked wooden coaster, opened. Following its first season, it was closed and extensively redone. When it reopened, it was a much smoother ride. In 1991, the camel hump before the last, or third, turn was replaced by a block brake. Though it decreased the speed of the ride after this particular brake, it did allow three trains to run per side at a time, greatly increasing capacity. One of the trains sometimes ran backwards for a few years in the mid-80s. However, until the late 1990s this kind of ride was no longer possible due to the newer ride system in place, as well as different trains. During ''Fright Fest'', the park runs one side backwards using a set of trains acquired from the now demolished [[Psyclone (roller coaster)|Psyclone]] which was located on the other side of the park. In 2015, the coaster was re-tracked with steel tracking and several inversions were added to the coaster. It was subsequently rebranded \"[[Twisted Colossus]]\". This renovation was completed by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]].\n\n===Six Flags era===\n[[File:Goliath drop.JPG|thumb|left|The opening drop on [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]]. Goliath featured the longest drop on a closed circuit roller coaster when it opened in February 2000.]]\nIn 1979, the park was sold to Six Flags and became known as Six Flags Magic Mountain. In 1981, Six Flags Magic Mountain introduced a ride that was on the west coast for the first time called [[Roaring Rapids]]. It was developed by [[Intamin]] in conjunction with the now defunct [[Six Flags Astroworld]], which had opened a similar ride in 1979. Along with Rapids came the completion of the midway near Spillikin Corners to link with Revolution's area. Finally, a complete circuit could be made around the park. It was originally designed as a dual-sided station, but only one was fully developed, and all that exists of the possible second side is a few supports. It uses large pumps to circulate water, and each of the two pumps can circulate 88,500 gallons per minute. The reservoir can hold 1.5 million gallons of water, and one of the innovations used on it was the introduction of guide boards to help eliminate jam ups.\n\nIn 1982, the attraction [[Freefall (ride)|Freefall]] was added. Also built by [[Intamin]], it was considered a cutting edge drop tower ride, if not strictly a \"roller coaster.\" It simply ascends the tower and then drops down, with the track curving to horizontal, leaving riders on their backs. Others were built for other parks (some of which are Six Flags). Today, most of these rides are obsolete and have been removed. Some flat rides were added and others removed the next year.\n\nIn 1984, [[Sarajevo Bobsleds]] was erected. Yet another ride built by [[Intamin]], the coaster was basically a bobsled without ice and snow. The coaster was built in honor of the [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Olympics]]. [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] added a similar ride that same year. In 1986, [[Sarajevo Bobsleds]] was removed and now operates at [[Six Flags Over Texas]] as [[La Vibora]]. The other bobsled was moved to [[Six Flags Great America]] and later to [[The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom|The Great Escape]] in [[Queensbury, New York]], where it operates as [[Alpine Bobsled]].\n\nIn 1985, Children's World was rethemed as [[Bugs Bunny]] World, as Magic Mountain had abandoned the Trolls in favor of the Warner Brothers' characters. That year, [[Michael Jackson]] visited the park, riding rides such as Colossus, Revolution and Roaring Rapids. In 1986, the park added a steel stand-up looping roller coaster called [[Batman The Escape|Shockwave]] designed by Intamin. This coaster was located in the back of the park replacing Sarajevo Bobsleds. At the end of 1988, the coaster was removed as part of a ride rotation program and went to Six Flags Great Adventure in 1990. It was removed from there in 1992 and was repainted white and rethemed upon its removal to [[Six Flags Astroworld]]. There it was known as Batman The Escape. When Astroworld closed in 2005, the ride was put in storage at [[Darien Lake]].\n\nIn 1987, the park re-themed the Back Street. Spinning flat rides were renamed Turbo (Electric Rainbow), Subway (Himalaya), and Reactor (Enterprise). The dance club was rethemed as well, and located near Reactor. After Hours, as it was now called (formerly Decibels), for one summer stayed open later than the rest of the park. It, along with Back Street, would stay open an additional two hours as a place for locals to hang out. This format lasted one season.\n\nIn 1988 [[Ninja (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Ninja]], \"The Black Belt of Roller Coasters\", opened. Built by [[Arrow Dynamics]], it was the first [[suspended swing roller coaster]] on the West coast. Ninja has gone through very few changes since it was opened in 1988; evidently only the wheels and paint have been changed.\n[[File:SFMM- Tidal Wave 1.JPG|thumb|[[Tidal Wave (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Tidal Wave]] is a Shoot the Chute water ride, featuring a {{Convert|50|ft|adj=on}} splashdown into a large body of water.]]\n[[Tidal Wave (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Tidal Wave]] opened in 1989. It is a short, wet ride featuring a large boat that travels up a low-angled incline to a level water trough. The trough, in the shape of a semicircle, ends in a steep drop into a large splashpool. The impact displaces large amounts of water on its riders. The ride's exit ramp crosses over the splashpool, allowing willing patrons leaving the ride to get soaked from the splash.\n\n[[File:Six Flags Magic Mountain Viper and X2 from Sky Tower cropped version.jpg|thumb|left|Viper, seen in the foreground, was constructed in the park in 1990]]\n\nIn 1990, [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Viper]], a multiple looping coaster designed by [[Arrow Dynamics]] opened. It features a {{convert|188|ft|m|adj=on}} drop, speeds up to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, 3 [[Inclined loop|vertical loops]], a batwing turn that inverts riders twice, and a double corkscrew.\n\nIn 1991, Magic Mountain added [[Psyclone (roller coaster)|Psyclone]], modeled after the [[Coney Island Cyclone]]. The Spillikin Corners area of the park was re-themed as Cyclone Bay to suit the new coaster, drawing guests into this area. The change was largely cosmetic, as the earlier theme relied on retail establishments that had been removed previously. The Glass Blower had been replaced by the Shooting Gallery, and the Candy Kitchen viewing area was redesigned. With Psyclone, the crowds returned. Due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Psyclone's structure was damaged, and the ride was eventually removed in 2007. After adding Ninja, Viper, and Psyclone within 4 years, the park was getting a large repertoire of big roller coasters.\n\nThe next year, 1992, a coaster built by Intamin called [[Flashback (roller coaster)|Flashback]] was added. This one-of-a-kind ride, originally planned to be enclosed in a building, had already operated at [[Six Flags Great America]] and [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] prior to its arrival. Very steep, short drops were designed to make riders feel like they were \"diving\" down in a plane, and it ended in a 540 degree upward spiral. But, because of the shoulder harnesses, riders were subjected to a lot of head banging. This coaster rarely ran by 1996 (it created too much noise for the nearby water park) and on January 23, 2007, the park announced that Flashback would be removed along with Psyclone. The park also stated that Flashback might be re-built elsewhere within the park for 2008 but the ride was finally scrapped at the end of 2008.\n\n===Time Warner era===\nIn 1993 Six Flags Magic Mountain entered the Time Warner era.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-21/business/fi-37629_1_time-warner |title=Time Warner Completes Six Flags Purchase \u2013 Los Angeles Times |newspaper=Los Angeles Times }}</ref> The new ride for the year was Yosemite Sam Sierra Falls. It was a water ride that has two twisting tubes that riders could slide down in using a raft. Also that year, there was re-theming and High Sierra Territory was opened. The Showcase Theatre became Golden Bear Theater, the Animal Star Theatre was created in Bugs Bunny World, and a large, fake, wooden tree was built. This year also saw the end of live non-Christian themed concerts in the park due to the riot that broke out as a result of a \"TLC\" concert that was oversold. Magic Mountain was quickly overwhelmed by large crowds that vandalized and destroyed property.  Park shops had their windows broken and looting quickly followed. Police were called to the scene in full riot gear. The park was evacuated and closed down for the night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-19/local/me-24654_1_magic-mountain |title=Magic Mountain Reopens After Melees \u2013 Los Angeles Times |newspaper=Los Angeles Times }}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Magic Mountain added what two other Six Flags parks already had, a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted looping roller coaster called [[Batman: The Ride]] (which other Six Flags parks also added in the coming years). Batman: the Ride (BTR) is an inverted coaster, meaning the usual coaster protocol is reversed; the track is overhead and the cars are below it. The trains travel on the outside of the loops, and rider's legs hang freely, as on a ski lift.\n\n[[File:SFMM- Sign 2.JPG|thumb|Signs to nearby rides and other attractions]]\nIn 1995, a separately gated waterpark called [[Six Flags Hurricane Harbor]] opened in June. The park included body slides, tube slides, a kiddie water play area, lazy river, and a wave pool. The following year, a [[SkyCoaster]] called Dive Devil opened at Magic Mountain.\n\nA dual launch coaster called [[Superman: Escape From Krypton|Superman: The Escape]] debuted at the park on March 15, 1997. Designed by [[Intamin]], the 30-second ride launches riders from 0 to {{Convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in seven seconds on a track that scales up a 41-story tower. It was the first roller coaster in the world to reach speeds of 100&nbsp;mph. In 2011, it received a new color scheme and was renamed \"Superman: Escape From Krypton\". In addition, the trains were reversed to provide a backward-facing launch.\n\n[[File:SFMM- Riddler's Revenge 5.JPG|thumb|The [[The Riddler's Revenge|Riddler's Revenge]] is a [[stand-up roller coaster]] which features 6 inversions.]]\nIn 1998, a new Bolliger & Mabillard [[Stand-up roller coaster]] called [[Riddler's Revenge]] opened as the tallest and fastest stand-up roller coaster in the world.\n\n===Premier Parks era===\nAlso in 1998 Six Flags was sold to Premier Parks. The next year saw no dramatic changes. In 2000, a steel [[hypercoaster]], [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]], was added. It was built by [[Giovanola]].\n\n2001 was to be the year of three new roller coasters, but only one actually opened on time: [[Goliath Jr.]], a steel kiddie coaster. The other two, [[Giant Inverted Boomerang|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]] and [[X\u00b2 (roller coaster)|X]] (now X\u00b2), had mechanical problems. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu opened late in 2001 and X opened early in 2002. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu was designed by [[Vekoma]] and is a Giant Inverted Boomerang coaster (GIB), a variant of their popular [[Boomerang (roller coaster)|Boomerang]] design. It is an inverted coaster with coaches suspended beneath an overhead track that traverses an open-circuit track forward and in reverse and features two completely vertical drops and three inversions. It opened late in 2001, but suffered a lot of downtime. X was designed by Arrow Dynamics, as the world's first \"fourth-dimensional\" roller coaster. It is the only one in North America where riders experience going 360 degrees in their seats. Each seat lies on a separate axis from the track. This coaster managed to open briefly on January 7, 2002, only to close due to more technical problems. It reopened late in August of that year. The ride closed for a major refurbishment and re-theme in 2008 where X transformed into X\u00b2.\n\nIn 2003, [[Scream (roller coaster)|Scream]], designed by Bolliger & Mabillard was added. At this point, Six Flags Magic Mountain tied with [[Cedar Point]] for the park with the most roller coasters in the United States. Scream is similar in concept with [[Medusa (Six Flags Discovery Kingdom)|Medusa]] at [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] and is a mirror image of [[Bizarro (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Bizarro]] at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]]. It is a [[floorless roller coaster]] with trains riding above the rails traversing seven inversions on {{convert|3985|ft|m}} of track on floorless trains. In 2006, [[Tatsu]], a Bolliger & Mabillard [[flying roller coaster]] was added, causing a temporary closure of Revolution to allow construction to take place. It was much larger than the other three Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coasters at other Six Flags parks, all named [[Superman: Ultimate Flight]].  Tatsu has a suspended-track orientation featuring vehicles that recline passengers with their backs against the track and facing the ground. This brought the park up to 17 roller coasters, to tie with Cedar Point for the greatest number of roller coasters in a park (albeit Flashback had been standing but not operating for an extended period of time and thus it is debatable whether the park could claim 17 as its number of roller coasters).\n\n===2006 attempted sale===\nOn June 22, 2006, Six Flags, Inc. announced that it was exploring options for six of its parks, including Magic Mountain and its neighboring water park, [[Six Flags Hurricane Harbor|Hurricane Harbor]]. Though management said closing the park was unlikely, rumors still began that the park could be sold to real estate developers, with an intent to close the park and build housing developments in the area.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher=Business Wire |date=June 22, 2006 | title=Six Flags to Explore Strategic Options for Six Properties \u2013 Buffalo, Concord, Denver, Seattle, Houston and Los Angeles; Company Provides Mid-Quarter Update on Operations | url=http://investors.sixflags.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=61629&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=875468&highlight= | accessdate=June 27, 2006}}</ref> Park officials cited dwindling attendance due to rowdy behavior among some of the park-goers (notably gang members and other teenagers and young adults, who account for a large percentage of the park's attendance{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2016}}) as reasons for wanting to sell the park while management was wanting to move Six Flags into more of a family park direction.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lance |last=Hart |url=http://www.screamscape.com/html/six_flags_magic_mountain.htm |title=Six Flags Magic Mountain |publisher=Screamscape.com |date=May 4, 2007 }}</ref> Throughout the Six Flags chain, attendance in the second quarter of 2006 was 14 percent lower than it was in the second quarter of 2005.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.the-signal.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=31912&format=html | url-status = dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224164921/http://www.the-signal.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=31912&format=html | archive-date=February 24, 2007 | title = Six Flags Posts 2Q Loss of $39.6 Mil. | first = Adam | last = Clark | date = August 3, 2006 | work = [[The Santa Clarita Valley Signal]]}}</ref>\n\nBy the fall of 2006, Six Flags announced that Magic Mountain was still up for sale. They also stated, however, that it would be sold to a company that would continue to operate it as a park, and that closing Magic Mountain was not a possibility. [[Cedar Fair]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], and several others considered buying the park but none of the offers came close to the asking price.\n\nWhen Six Flags announced which parks it was selling in January 2007, Magic Mountain was no longer one of them. The company decided not to sell Magic Mountain and its adjacent water park. Spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg said that upon further evaluation, the company decided that the Los Angeles parks remained too valuable to relinquish, as sales were increasing, and that the park would not be sold. Other parks were sold as a package and remained open.\n\n===2007\u2013present===\n[[File:SFMM Magic Flyer.jpg|thumb|Magic flyer roller coaster]]\n[[File:SFMM- Scream.jpg|thumb|Scream roller coaster]]\n[[File:Tatsu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tatsu]], one of the roller coasters at Six Flags Magic Mountain.]]\n[[File:SFMM- Twisted Colossus 2.jpg|thumb|[[Twisted Colossus]], one of Magic Mountain's most signature and iconic roller coasters.

As a result, Six Flags Magic Mountain no longer tied the record for the most roller coasters in a single park, relinquishing the record to [[Cedar Point]] \u2013 the park's total had never surpassed Cedar Point but had tied numerous times. The park began focusing more attention on marketing with family-oriented values, and a new children's theme area, [[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends|Thomas Town]], was added in 2008. The park renovated one its thrill rides, however. \"X\" was closed in late 2007 for its transformation into X<sup>2</sup> which featured new fourth-generation trains, a new paint job, and special effects that included flame throwers and audio. It reopened in 2008. In the same year, the park began work on the \"Magic of the Mountain\" museum at the top of its Sky Tower attraction that contained memorabilia throughout the park's history including old television commercials, park maps, models, and equipment saved from defunct rides.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_8412730 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304113622/http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_8412730 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2008 |title=Teen creating some magic with his Six Flags museum \u2013 LA Daily News |newspaper=Daily News |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Apocalypse: The Ride|Terminator Salvation: The Ride]], a wooden roller coaster, opened on May 23, 2009.

Please keep to major, notable releases. -->\nMagic Mountain's proximity to downtown Los Angeles, the hub of the American film and television industry, has resulted in its appearance in several productions, usually representing a park other than itself. The debut of ''Revolution'' was the focal point of the 1977 release ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]''. [[Bob Einstein]], as his character [[Super Dave Osborne]], performed his first \"stunt\" on a rollercoster at Magic Mountain. In 1983, Magic Mountain became the fictional \"Walley World\" for ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', with scenes featuring ''Revolution'' and ''Colossus'' (each using fictional names). On television, Magic Mountain doubled as the theme park in the opening credits of the television series ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]''. Other TV productions featuring Magic Mountain have included: [[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]], ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'',  ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[Way Out Games]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[The King of Queens]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. The band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] also filmed their acting debut in 1978's [[made-for-TV]] ''[[Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park]]'' that featured the band members in the park and near Colossus.  In the 2000 movie ''[[Space Cowboys]]'' Donald Sutherland is shown riding Viper and is portrayed as the designer when Clint Eastwood recruits him.\n\nMagic Mountain was also the filming site for the [[Real Wheels]] video, \"Here Comes A Roller Coaster\", as well as for the ''[[Kidsongs]]'' 1990 video, \"Ride the Roller Coaster\".\n\nIn the [[Nickelodeon]] show ''[[Drake & Josh]]'', Drake, Josh, and Megan take a trip to Mystic Mountain (parody of Magic Mountain) in the episode \"The Demonator\", and they ride the \"Demonator\". On ''[[Zoey 101]]'' Zoey and Lisa take Michael to Mystic Mountain (both series were created by [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]), and they help Michael overcome his roller coaster fear in the episode \"Rollercoaster\". He rides the \"Spine Twister\", which was actually the [[Goliath (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Goliath]] from Magic Mountain. In 1990, Nickelodeon's ''[[Wild and Crazy Kids]]'', the wooden roller coaster,Colossus, was featured as a game called \"Wacky RollerCoaster Spill\". In the movie ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', the band performs as second billing to a puppet show at the fictional \"Themeland Amusement Park\" in [[Stockton, California]], located {{convert|300|mi|km}} north of Santa Clarita. The actual filming location is Magic Mountain's amphitheater. The [[Kidsongs]] video ''Ride the Roller Coaster'' is set at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Nick Cannon group ''[[The School Gyrls]]'' movie premiere was at Magic Mountain. In the film ''[[Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer]]'', they go to a theme park and ride a roller coaster for the first time. The coaster was Goliath. Goliath was also featured as the \"Aquaman\" roller coaster in the third season of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.\n\nIn 2011, the park was chosen as the setting for the [[Travel Channel]]'s version of the quiz show ''[[Scream! If You Know the Answer]]''. The ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' cast visited the park in 2012 for their senior skip day in the \"[[Big Brother (Glee)|Big Brother]]\" episode, where they ride [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Viper]].<ref name=\"Glee\">{{cite web|title=Six Flags Magic Mountain has a cameo appearance ...|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150799927722125&set=a.111563082124.115580.67502107124&type=1|author=Six Flags Magic Mountain|publisher=Facebook|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a large section of the parking lot was blocked off for a Toyota Camry commercial. Both pictures and the background footage reveal Goliath and Colossus, indicating that it is Magic Mountain where the commercial was shot.

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain| Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death on 1759, his half-brother [[Charles III of Spain| Charles III]] reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called [[Pacte de Famille| Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions| embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref> \n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson| Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney| Rear-Admiral Rodney, who was commanding operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops and proceeding to the northwest of [[Haiti]] to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref> These plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)| pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them.<ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s ling, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>    \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. It had several advantages besides the hope of a relief force. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref> During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 241</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock p. 244</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.<ref>Guiteras pp. 146-147</ref>\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August.<ref>Guiteras pp. 149,163</ref> Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival.

Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain| Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death on 1759, his half-brother [[Charles III of Spain| Charles III]] reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called [[Pacte de Famille| Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions| embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref> \n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson| Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney| Rear-Admiral Rodney, who was commanding operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops and proceeding to the northwest of [[Haiti]] to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref> These plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)| pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them.<ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s ling, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>    \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. It had several advantages besides the hope of a relief force. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref> During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 241</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock p. 244</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.<ref>Guiteras pp. 146-147</ref>\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August.<ref>Guiteras pp. 149,163</ref> Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival.

Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]].

Believers claim the image depicts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and the fabric is the [[burial shroud]] in which he was wrapped after crucifixion, but it was first securely attested in 1390, when a local bishop wrote that an unnamed artist had confessed to the forgery, and [[radiocarbon dating]] of a sample of the fabric is consistent with this.\n\nThe artifact is kept in the [[Cathedral of Turin]], which is located next to a complex of buildings composed of the [[Royal Palace of Turin]], the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]] (located inside the Royal Palace and formerly connected to the Cathedral), and the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]], northern Italy.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 [[Pope Pius XII]] approved of the image in association with the [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].<ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}, p. 200.</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] called the Shroud \"a mirror of the Gospel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-and-shroud-turin |title=Pope Francis and the Shroud of Turin - National Catholic Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=April 2013 }}</ref><ref>Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin, Italy, 23\u201324 May 1998 [http://shroudnm.com/docs/JPII05-24-1998.pdf]</ref> Other [[Christian denominations]], such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.<ref name=\"Dreisbach2001\"/> Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove, contrary to the scientific consensus, that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

They found traces of 19 different plant [[Taxon|taxa]], including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human [[mtDNA]], sequences were found belonging to [[haplogroup]]s that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non-plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada.<ref name = \"Barcaccia 2015\"/> After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places came in contact with the shroud.

The comparison between different tests demonstrated that the blood patterns on the forearms and on the back of the hand are not connected, and would have had to occur at different times, as a result of a very specific sequence of movements. In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see [[oshiguma]]; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of [[starch]] fractions, various [[sugars]], and other impurities.

Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid [[decomposition]] products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G.

As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.<ref>G.M.Rinaldi, \"Il Codice Pray\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html</ref>  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.\n\nThe first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> and the first certain record (in [[Lirey]], [[France]]) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.<ref name=\"Poulle 2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see [[oshiguma]]; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact?

(McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it.

As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud.

I think there is no basis for such dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly rejected both sides of the arguments\u2014on the virtues of vegetarianism or meat eating\u2014as banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served it to his followers and ate himself. History is quite clear that Guru Hargobind and Guru Gobind Singh were accomplished and avid hunters.

After releasing two albums with the band, he released his debut solo album ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' in 1979, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]].

After recording an album's worth of [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] (released in 1984 as ''[[The Plan (Tubeway Army album)|The Plan]]''), he was signed by [[Beggars Banquet Records]] in 1978 and quickly released two singles, \"[[That's Too Bad]]\" and \"[[Bombers (Gary Numan song)|Bombers]]\", neither of which charted.\n\nA self-titled, [[New wave music|new wave]]-oriented [[Tubeway Army (album)|debut album]] later that same year sold out its limited run and introduced Numan's fascination with [[dystopia]]n science fiction<ref name=Europopmusic>{{cite web|title=Part 6: \"Are friends electric? \"|url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/Newsletters/History_electronic_music_part_6.html|work=The history of electronic music within European pop?\"|publisher=Europopmusic|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> and synthesisers. Tubeway Army's third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced \"[[Down in the Park]]\" (1979), and though it never appeared on the charts, it became one of Numan's most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the 1980 film ''[[Times Square (1980 film)|Times Square]]'', and a live version of the song can be seen in the 1982 film ''[[Urgh! A Music War]]''. Following exposure in a television advertisement for [[Lee Cooper]] jeans with the jingle \"Don't Be a Dummy\",<ref name=Europopmusic /> Tubeway Army released the single \"[[Are \"Friends\" Electric?|Are 'Friends' Electric?]]\" in May 1979. After seven weeks the single climbed to No.&nbsp;1 at the end of June; its parent album ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'' simultaneously reached No.&nbsp;1.\n\nA few months later Numan found success in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with \"[[Cars (song)|Cars]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in 1979, No.&nbsp;1 in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=ccntousk30frf6h4jsn237nm12|title=Item Display \u2013 RPM \u2013 Library and Archives Canada|publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca|accessdate=8 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113072100/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=ccntousk30frf6h4jsn237nm12|archive-date=13 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and No.&nbsp;9 in the U.S. in 1980. \"Cars\" and the 1979 album ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' were both released under Numan's own stage name. The album reached number-one in the UK, and a sell-out tour (''The Touring Principle'') followed; the [[Concert film|concert video]] it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial [[music video]] release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-this-day.com/onthisday/thedays/music/apr14.htm|title=Music history for April 14 from|publisher=On-This-Day.com|date=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html|title=Review: Gary Numan/Tubeway Army, Premier Hits - Derek Langsford|publisher=Westnet.com|accessdate=14 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223724/http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> ''The Pleasure Principle'' was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesisers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, \"[[Complex (song)|Complex]]\", made it to No.&nbsp;6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n===1980\u20131990: Record label foundation and collaborations===\nIn 1980, Numan topped the album charts for a third time with ''[[Telekon]]'', with the singles \"[[We Are Glass]]\", \"[[I Die: You Die]]\" released prior to the album reaching No.&nbsp;5 and No.&nbsp;6. \"[[This Wreckage]]\" taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20. ''Telekon'', the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the \"Machine\" section of his career,<ref>Gary Numan (1981). ''Living Ornaments '79/'80'': LP Liner notes</ref> reintroduced guitars to Numan's music and featured a wider range of synthesisers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour (\"The Teletour\") with an even more elaborate stage show than ''the Touring Principle'' the previous year. He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at [[Wembley Arena]] in April 1981, supported by experimental musician [[Nash the Slash]] and [[Shock (troupe)|Shock]], a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included [[Barbie Wilde]], [[Tik and Tok]], and [[Carole Caplin]]. A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No.&nbsp;2 in the charts. Both albums, also individually released as ''[[Living Ornaments '79]]'' and ''[[Living Ornaments '80]]'' also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.\n\nDeparting from the pure [[electropop]] that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with [[jazz]], [[funk]], and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was ''[[Dance (Gary Numan album)|Dance]]'' (1981). The album charted as high as No.&nbsp;3 on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK charts]], with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single (\"[[She's Got Claws]]\") reaching No.&nbsp;6.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/she%27s%20got%20claws/|title=She's Got Claws {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref> The album featured several distinguished guest players; [[Mick Karn]] (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Roger Mason (musician)|Roger Mason]] (keyboards) of [[Models (band)|Models]], and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums) of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=\"Discogs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792|title=Gary Numan - Dance (Vinyl, LP, Album)|date=|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as [[Dramatis]], Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit \"Love Needs No Disguise\" from the album ''[[For Future Reference]]'' and lent vocals to the first single release by his long-term bassist [[Paul Gardiner]], \"[[Stormtrooper in Drag]]\", which also made the charts. However, Numan's career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as [[Adam Ant]], and later by [[the Human League]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Depeche Mode]]. Each album also saw a new \"image\", none of which captured the public's imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979.<ref name=Lester />\n\nThe album ''[[I, Assassin]]'' (1982) fared less well than ''Dance''. Despite producing one Top 10 and two Top 20 singles, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;8 with a six-week chart run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/i,%20assassin/|title=I, Assassin {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref> \n\n''[[Warriors (Gary Numan album)|Warriors]]'' (1983) further developed Numan's jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] musician [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album's co-producer), and saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]] (who would play on most of Numan's albums until 1991).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;12, produced two hit singles including the Top 20 title-track and, like ''I, Assassin'', spent six weeks in the charts. ''Warriors'' was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nNuman subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa. The first album released on Numa, 1984's ''[[Berserker (Gary Numan album)|Berserker]]'' was also notable for being Numan's first foray into music computers/[[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], in this case the [[Palm Products GmbH|PPG Wave]]. The album was accompanied by a new blue-and-white visual image (including Numan himself with blue hair), a tour, a live album/video/EP, and the title track reached the UK Top 40 when released as a single. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans and commercially it was Numan's least successful release to that point.\n\nNuman's next album, ''[[The Fury (album)|The Fury]]'' (1985), charted slightly higher than ''Berserker'' breaking the Top 30. Again, the album heralded a change of image, this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie. Four singles were released from the album, all reaching the UK Top 50.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nCollaborations with [[Bill Sharpe (musician)|Bill Sharpe]] of [[Shakatak]] as [[Sharpe & Numan]] helped little, though two singles that the duo recorded did see chart action: \"[[Change Your Mind (Sharpe & Numan song)|Change Your Mind]]\", reached No.&nbsp;17 in 1985, and \"No More Lies\" reached No.&nbsp;35 in 1988. In 1987, Numan performed vocals for three singles by [[Radio Heart]], a project of brothers Hugh and David Nicholson, formerly of [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]] and [[Blue (Scottish band)|Blue]], which charted with varying success (\"Radio Heart\" No. 35 UK, \"London Times\" No. 48, \"All Across The Nation\" #81).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24040/radio-heart-featuring-gary-numan/|title=Radio Heart {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> An album was also released, credited to \"Radio Heart featuring Gary Numan\" although Numan only appeared on three tracks, but failed to chart. Also in 1987, Numan's old label Beggars Banquet released the best-of compilation \"Exhibition\", which reached No. 43 on the UK albums chart,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/exhibition/|title=Exhibition {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> and a remix of \"Cars\".

Numan then signed to [[I.R.S. Records]] though his final studio album of the 1980s, ''[[Metal Rhythm]]'' (1988), also sold relatively poorly. For its American release, the record label changed the album's title to ''New Anger'' after the album's lead single, changed the album colour from black to blue, and remixed several of its tracks against Numan's wishes. In 1989, the Sharpe & Numan album ''[[Automatic (Sharpe & Numan album)|Automatic]]'' was released through [[Polydor Records]], though this too failed to garner much commercial success, briefly entering the charts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===1991\u20132008: Worldwide acknowledgement ===\n[[File:MrGaryNuman.jpg|thumb|right|Numan performing in 2007]]\nIn 1991, Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for ''[[The Unborn (1991 film)|The Unborn]]'' with Michael R. Smith (the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995, ''Human''). After ''[[Outland (Gary Numan album)|Outland]]'' (1991), another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with I.R.S., Numan reactivated Numa Records, under which he would release his next two albums. He supported [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (who had opened for him in 1979) on a 1993 arena tour. By 1994, Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes, including his vocal [[atheism]]. His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years. Numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher, more [[industrial music|industrial]] direction with his songwriting on the album ''[[Sacrifice (Gary Numan album)|Sacrifice]]''&mdash;for the first time he played almost all the instruments himself. The move was critically well-received, as Numan's harder and darker sound emerged just as Numan-influenced bands like [[Nine Inch Nails]] were enjoying their first rush of fame.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The influence was two-way; Numan claimed that Nine Inch Nails' song \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" is his favourite hit single of all time, and influenced his music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} ''Sacrifice'' was the last album Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently. His next two studio albums, ''[[Exile (Gary Numan album)|Exile]]'' (1997) and ''[[Pure (Gary Numan album)|Pure]]'' (2000), were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation, as did a [[tribute album]], ''[[Random (album)|Random]]'', released shortly before ''Exile''. that featured artists like [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jesus Jones]] who had been influenced by Numan. Numan toured the U.S. in support of ''Exile'', his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s.<ref name=Lester /> [[Fear Factory]] produced a cover of \"Cars\" (featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself) for the [[digipak]] version of their 1999 album, ''[[Obsolete (album)|Obsolete]]''. Numan had become acknowledged and respected by his peers, with such musicians as [[Dave Grohl]] (of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), [[Trent Reznor]] (of Nine Inch Nails), and [[Marilyn Manson]] proclaiming his work an influence and recording cover versions of old Numan hits.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=marilyn+manson+gary+numan#v=onepage&q=marilyn%20manson%20gary%20numan&f=false|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|accessdate=15 May 2011|date=May 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sally Williams |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/11/16/gary-numan-dave-grohl-is-very-nice-man-91466-25163264/ |title=Gary Numan: 'Dave Grohl is very nice man' |publisher=WalesOnline |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015134845/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/11/16/gary-numan-dave-grohl-is-very-nice-man-91466-25163264/ |archivedate=15 October 2012 }}</ref> The band [[Basement Jaxx]] had a huge hit in 2002 with \"[[Where's Your Head At]]\", which relied on a sample of Numan's \"M.E.\"&mdash;from ''The Pleasure Principle''&mdash;for its hook. Nine Inch Nails covered the song \"Metal\" on [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]] remix album ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'' as did [[Afrika Bambaataa]] (with Numan himself) on the album ''[[Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light]]''. \"Cars\" remains Numan's most enduring song; it was a hit again in 1987 (remixed by [[Zeus B. Held]]) and 1996, in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for [[Carling brewery]]. In 2000, DJ [[Armand Van Helden]] sampled the track and mixed it up in his single \"[[Koochy]]\" which conquered the dance floors. In 2002, English [[girl group]] the [[Sugababes]] scored a No.&nbsp;1 with \"[[Freak Like Me#Sugababes version|Freak Like Me]]\"&mdash;a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of [[Adina Howard]]'s \"Freak Like Me\" and \"Are \"Friends\" Electric?\" by Numan's Tubeway Army.\n\nIn 2002, Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single \"Rip\", reaching No.&nbsp;29 on the UK Singles Chart and in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single \"[[Crazier (Gary Numan song)|Crazier]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;13 in the UK chart. Rico also worked on the remix album ''Hybrid'' which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material. Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included [[Curve (band)|Curve]], [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], [[Andy Gray (musician)|Andy Gray]], [[Alan Moulder]], New Disease, and Sulpher. 2003 also saw Numan performing the vocals on a track named \"Pray for You\" on the [[Plump DJs]] album ''Eargasm''. In 2004, Numan took control of his own business affairs again, launching the label Mortal Records and releasing a series of live DVDs. On 13 March 2006, Numan's album, ''[[Jagged]]'', was released. An album launch gig took place at [[The Forum, London]] on 18 March followed by UK, European and U.S. tours in support of the release. Numan also launched a ''Jagged'' website to showcase the new album, and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert (previously released as ''Micromusic'' on VHS) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the ''Jagged'' album launch gig. Numan undertook a ''Telekon'' 'Classic Album' tour in the UK in December 2006.\n\nNuman contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of the debut solo album by Ade Fenton, ''Artificial Perfect'', on his new industrial/electronic label, Submission, including \"The Leather Sea\", \"Slide Away\", \"Recall\", and the first single to be taken from the album, \"Healing\". The second single to be released in the UK was \"The Leather Sea\" on 30 July 2007, which charted.\n\nHe sold out a 15-date UK & Ireland tour in spring 2008 during which he performed his 1979 number-one album ''Replicas'' in its entirety, and all the Replicas-era music including [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26872_0_2_0_C|title=Gary Numan to perform album 'Replicas' live|publisher=Side-line.com|date=2 November 2007|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> The successful tour also raised Numan's profile in the media again due to the fact that it coincided with his 30th anniversary in the music business.\n\nIn November 2007, Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new album, with the working title of ''Splinter'', would be under way throughout 2008, after finishing an alternate version of ''Jagged'' (called ''[[Jagged Edge (Gary Numan album)|Jagged Edge]]'') and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three albums (confirmed to be titled ''Dead Son Rising'' on 1 December 2008 via official mailing list message).

A second single from the album, \"[[Complex (song)|Complex]]\", made it to No.&nbsp;6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n===1980\u20131990: Record label foundation and collaborations===\nIn 1980, Numan topped the album charts for a third time with ''[[Telekon]]'', with the singles \"[[We Are Glass]]\", \"[[I Die: You Die]]\" released prior to the album reaching No.&nbsp;5 and No.&nbsp;6. \"[[This Wreckage]]\" taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20. ''Telekon'', the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the \"Machine\" section of his career,<ref>Gary Numan (1981). ''Living Ornaments '79/'80'': LP Liner notes</ref> reintroduced guitars to Numan's music and featured a wider range of synthesisers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour (\"The Teletour\") with an even more elaborate stage show than ''the Touring Principle'' the previous year. He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at [[Wembley Arena]] in April 1981, supported by experimental musician [[Nash the Slash]] and [[Shock (troupe)|Shock]], a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included [[Barbie Wilde]], [[Tik and Tok]], and [[Carole Caplin]]. A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No.&nbsp;2 in the charts. Both albums, also individually released as ''[[Living Ornaments '79]]'' and ''[[Living Ornaments '80]]'' also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.\n\nDeparting from the pure [[electropop]] that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with [[jazz]], [[funk]], and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was ''[[Dance (Gary Numan album)|Dance]]'' (1981). The album charted as high as No.&nbsp;3 on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK charts]], with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single (\"[[She's Got Claws]]\") reaching No.&nbsp;6.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/she%27s%20got%20claws/|title=She's Got Claws {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref> The album featured several distinguished guest players; [[Mick Karn]] (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Roger Mason (musician)|Roger Mason]] (keyboards) of [[Models (band)|Models]], and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums) of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=\"Discogs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792|title=Gary Numan - Dance (Vinyl, LP, Album)|date=|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as [[Dramatis]], Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit \"Love Needs No Disguise\" from the album ''[[For Future Reference]]'' and lent vocals to the first single release by his long-term bassist [[Paul Gardiner]], \"[[Stormtrooper in Drag]]\", which also made the charts. However, Numan's career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as [[Adam Ant]], and later by [[the Human League]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Depeche Mode]]. Each album also saw a new \"image\", none of which captured the public's imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979.<ref name=Lester />\n\nThe album ''[[I, Assassin]]'' (1982) fared less well than ''Dance''. Despite producing one Top 10 and two Top 20 singles, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;8 with a six-week chart run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/i,%20assassin/|title=I, Assassin {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref> \n\n''[[Warriors (Gary Numan album)|Warriors]]'' (1983) further developed Numan's jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] musician [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album's co-producer), and saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]] (who would play on most of Numan's albums until 1991).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;12, produced two hit singles including the Top 20 title-track and, like ''I, Assassin'', spent six weeks in the charts. ''Warriors'' was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nNuman subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa. The first album released on Numa, 1984's ''[[Berserker (Gary Numan album)|Berserker]]'' was also notable for being Numan's first foray into music computers/[[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], in this case the [[Palm Products GmbH|PPG Wave]]. The album was accompanied by a new blue-and-white visual image (including Numan himself with blue hair), a tour, a live album/video/EP, and the title track reached the UK Top 40 when released as a single. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans and commercially it was Numan's least successful release to that point.\n\nNuman's next album, ''[[The Fury (album)|The Fury]]'' (1985), charted slightly higher than ''Berserker'' breaking the Top 30. Again, the album heralded a change of image, this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie. Four singles were released from the album, all reaching the UK Top 50.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nCollaborations with [[Bill Sharpe (musician)|Bill Sharpe]] of [[Shakatak]] as [[Sharpe & Numan]] helped little, though two singles that the duo recorded did see chart action: \"[[Change Your Mind (Sharpe & Numan song)|Change Your Mind]]\", reached No.&nbsp;17 in 1985, and \"No More Lies\" reached No.&nbsp;35 in 1988. In 1987, Numan performed vocals for three singles by [[Radio Heart]], a project of brothers Hugh and David Nicholson, formerly of [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]] and [[Blue (Scottish band)|Blue]], which charted with varying success (\"Radio Heart\" No. 35 UK, \"London Times\" No. 48, \"All Across The Nation\" #81).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24040/radio-heart-featuring-gary-numan/|title=Radio Heart {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> An album was also released, credited to \"Radio Heart featuring Gary Numan\" although Numan only appeared on three tracks, but failed to chart. Also in 1987, Numan's old label Beggars Banquet released the best-of compilation \"Exhibition\", which reached No. 43 on the UK albums chart,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/exhibition/|title=Exhibition {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> and a remix of \"Cars\".

Numan then signed to [[I.R.S. Records]] though his final studio album of the 1980s, ''[[Metal Rhythm]]'' (1988), also sold relatively poorly. For its American release, the record label changed the album's title to ''New Anger'' after the album's lead single, changed the album colour from black to blue, and remixed several of its tracks against Numan's wishes. In 1989, the Sharpe & Numan album ''[[Automatic (Sharpe & Numan album)|Automatic]]'' was released through [[Polydor Records]], though this too failed to garner much commercial success, briefly entering the charts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===1991\u20132008: Worldwide acknowledgement ===\n[[File:MrGaryNuman.jpg|thumb|right|Numan performing in 2007]]\nIn 1991, Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for ''[[The Unborn (1991 film)|The Unborn]]'' with Michael R. Smith (the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995, ''Human''). After ''[[Outland (Gary Numan album)|Outland]]'' (1991), another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with I.R.S., Numan reactivated Numa Records, under which he would release his next two albums. He supported [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (who had opened for him in 1979) on a 1993 arena tour. By 1994, Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes, including his vocal [[atheism]]. His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years. Numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher, more [[industrial music|industrial]] direction with his songwriting on the album ''[[Sacrifice (Gary Numan album)|Sacrifice]]''&mdash;for the first time he played almost all the instruments himself. The move was critically well-received, as Numan's harder and darker sound emerged just as Numan-influenced bands like [[Nine Inch Nails]] were enjoying their first rush of fame.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The influence was two-way; Numan claimed that Nine Inch Nails' song \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" is his favourite hit single of all time, and influenced his music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} ''Sacrifice'' was the last album Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently. His next two studio albums, ''[[Exile (Gary Numan album)|Exile]]'' (1997) and ''[[Pure (Gary Numan album)|Pure]]'' (2000), were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation, as did a [[tribute album]], ''[[Random (album)|Random]]'', released shortly before ''Exile''. that featured artists like [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jesus Jones]] who had been influenced by Numan. Numan toured the U.S. in support of ''Exile'', his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s.<ref name=Lester /> [[Fear Factory]] produced a cover of \"Cars\" (featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself) for the [[digipak]] version of their 1999 album, ''[[Obsolete (album)|Obsolete]]''. Numan had become acknowledged and respected by his peers, with such musicians as [[Dave Grohl]] (of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), [[Trent Reznor]] (of Nine Inch Nails), and [[Marilyn Manson]] proclaiming his work an influence and recording cover versions of old Numan hits.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=marilyn+manson+gary+numan#v=onepage&q=marilyn%20manson%20gary%20numan&f=false|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|accessdate=15 May 2011|date=May 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sally Williams |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/11/16/gary-numan-dave-grohl-is-very-nice-man-91466-25163264/ |title=Gary Numan: 'Dave Grohl is very nice man' |publisher=WalesOnline |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015134845/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/11/16/gary-numan-dave-grohl-is-very-nice-man-91466-25163264/ |archivedate=15 October 2012 }}</ref> The band [[Basement Jaxx]] had a huge hit in 2002 with \"[[Where's Your Head At]]\", which relied on a sample of Numan's \"M.E.\"&mdash;from ''The Pleasure Principle''&mdash;for its hook. Nine Inch Nails covered the song \"Metal\" on [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]] remix album ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'' as did [[Afrika Bambaataa]] (with Numan himself) on the album ''[[Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light]]''. \"Cars\" remains Numan's most enduring song; it was a hit again in 1987 (remixed by [[Zeus B. Held]]) and 1996, in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for [[Carling brewery]]. In 2000, DJ [[Armand Van Helden]] sampled the track and mixed it up in his single \"[[Koochy]]\" which conquered the dance floors. In 2002, English [[girl group]] the [[Sugababes]] scored a No.&nbsp;1 with \"[[Freak Like Me#Sugababes version|Freak Like Me]]\"&mdash;a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of [[Adina Howard]]'s \"Freak Like Me\" and \"Are \"Friends\" Electric?\" by Numan's Tubeway Army.\n\nIn 2002, Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single \"Rip\", reaching No.&nbsp;29 on the UK Singles Chart and in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single \"[[Crazier (Gary Numan song)|Crazier]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;13 in the UK chart. Rico also worked on the remix album ''Hybrid'' which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material. Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included [[Curve (band)|Curve]], [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], [[Andy Gray (musician)|Andy Gray]], [[Alan Moulder]], New Disease, and Sulpher. 2003 also saw Numan performing the vocals on a track named \"Pray for You\" on the [[Plump DJs]] album ''Eargasm''. In 2004, Numan took control of his own business affairs again, launching the label Mortal Records and releasing a series of live DVDs. On 13 March 2006, Numan's album, ''[[Jagged]]'', was released. An album launch gig took place at [[The Forum, London]] on 18 March followed by UK, European and U.S. tours in support of the release. Numan also launched a ''Jagged'' website to showcase the new album, and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert (previously released as ''Micromusic'' on VHS) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the ''Jagged'' album launch gig. Numan undertook a ''Telekon'' 'Classic Album' tour in the UK in December 2006.\n\nNuman contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of the debut solo album by Ade Fenton, ''Artificial Perfect'', on his new industrial/electronic label, Submission, including \"The Leather Sea\", \"Slide Away\", \"Recall\", and the first single to be taken from the album, \"Healing\". The second single to be released in the UK was \"The Leather Sea\" on 30 July 2007, which charted.\n\nHe sold out a 15-date UK & Ireland tour in spring 2008 during which he performed his 1979 number-one album ''Replicas'' in its entirety, and all the Replicas-era music including [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26872_0_2_0_C|title=Gary Numan to perform album 'Replicas' live|publisher=Side-line.com|date=2 November 2007|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> The successful tour also raised Numan's profile in the media again due to the fact that it coincided with his 30th anniversary in the music business.\n\nIn November 2007, Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new album, with the working title of ''Splinter'', would be under way throughout 2008, after finishing an alternate version of ''Jagged'' (called ''[[Jagged Edge (Gary Numan album)|Jagged Edge]]'') and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three albums (confirmed to be titled ''Dead Son Rising'' on 1 December 2008 via official mailing list message).

It is the snail-shaped shell containing several nerve endings that makes hearing possible.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ototoxicity|work=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|title=ototoxicity}}</ref>\nOtotoxicity typically results when the inner ear is poisoned by medication that damages the cochlea, vestibule, semi-circular canals, or the auditory/ vestibulocochlear nerve. The damaged structure then produces the symptoms the patient presents with. Ototoxicity in the cochlea may cause hearing loss of the high-frequency pitch ranges or complete deafness, or losses at points between.<ref name=Mudd>{{cite web|last=Mudd|first=Pamela | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ototoxicity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/857679-overview|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=30 Nov 2011}}</ref>  It may present with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms, or asymmetrically, with one ear developing the condition after the other or not at all.<ref name=Mudd/> The time frames for progress of the disease vary greatly and symptoms of hearing loss may be temporary or permanent.<ref name=Farlex/>\n\nThe [[vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] and [[semi-circular canal]] are inner-ear components that comprise the vestibular system. Together they detect all directions of head movement. Two types of [[otolith organs]] are housed in the vestibule: the [[saccule]], which points vertically and detects vertical acceleration, and the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]], which points horizontally and detects horizontal acceleration. The otolith organs together sense the head's position with respect to gravity when the body is static; then the head's movement when it tilts; and pitch changes during any linear motion of the head. The saccule and utricle detect different motions, which information the brain receives and integrates to determine where the head is and how and where it is moving.\n\nThe semi-circular canals are three bony structures filled with fluid. As with the vestibule, the primary purpose of the canals is to detect movement. Each canal is oriented at right angles to the others, enabling detection of movement in any plane. The posterior canal detects rolling motion, or motion about the X axis; the anterior canal detects pitch, or motion about the Y axis; the horizontal canal detects yaw motion, or motion about the Z axis. \nWhen a medication is toxic in the vestibule or the semi-circular canals, the patient senses loss of balance or orientation rather than losses in hearing. Symptoms in these organs present as vertigo, difficulties walking in low light and darkness, disequilibrium, oscillopsia among others.<ref name=Mudd/> Each of these problems is related to balance and the mind is confused with the direction of motion or lack of motion. Both the vestibule and semi-circular canals transmit information to the brain about movement; when these are poisoned, they are unable to function properly which results in miscommunication with the brain.\n\nWhen the vestibule and/or semi-circular canals are affected by ototoxicity, the eye can also be affected. [[Nystagmus]] and [[oscillopsia]] are two conditions that overlap the vestibular and ocular systems. These symptoms cause the patient to have difficulties with seeing and processing images. The body subconsciously tries to compensate for the imbalance signals being sent to the brain by trying to obtain visual cues to support the information it is receiving. This results in that dizziness and \"woozy\" feeling patients use to describe conditions such as oscillopsia and vertigo.<ref name=Mudd/>\n\n[[Cranial nerve VIII]] is the least affected component of the ear when ototoxicity arises, but if the nerve is affected, the damage is most often permanent. Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage, including tinnitus, ringing of the ears, difficulty walking, deafness, and balance and orientation issues.\n\n==Ototoxic agents==\n\n===Antibiotics===\nAntibiotics in the [[aminoglycoside]] class, such as [[gentamicin]] and [[tobramycin]], may produce cochleotoxicity through a poorly understood mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid16549744\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobie RA, Black FO, Pezsnecker SC, Stallings VL | title = Hearing loss in patients with vestibulotoxic reactions to gentamicin therapy | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 132 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u20137 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16549744 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.132.3.253 }}</ref> It may result from antibiotic binding to [[NMDA receptor]]s in the [[cochlea]] and damaging [[neuron]]s through [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name=\"pmid8946832\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Basile AS, Huang JM, Xie C, Webster D, Berlin C, Skolnick P | title = N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists limit aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hearing loss | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1338\u201343 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8946832 | doi = 10.1038/nm1296-1338 }}</ref> Aminoglycoside-induced production of [[reactive oxygen species]] may also injure cells of the [[cochlea]].<ref name=\"pmid12053140\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WJ, Sha SH, Schacht J | title = Recent advances in understanding aminoglycoside ototoxicity and its prevention | journal = Audiology and Neuro-Otology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 171\u20134 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12053140 | doi = 10.1159/000058305 }}</ref> Once-daily dosing<ref name=\"pmid8722531\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Munckhof WJ, Grayson ML, Turnidge JD | title = A meta-analysis of studies on the safety and efficacy of aminoglycosides given either once daily or as divided doses | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 645\u201363 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8722531 | doi = 10.1093/jac/37.4.645 }}</ref> and co-administration of [[N-acetylcysteine|''N''-acetylcysteine]]<ref name=\"pmid17653228\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tepel M | title = N-Acetylcysteine in the prevention of ototoxicity | journal = Kidney International | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 231\u20132 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17653228 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ki.5002299 }}</ref> may protect against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.

The damaged structure then produces the symptoms the patient presents with. Ototoxicity in the cochlea may cause hearing loss of the high-frequency pitch ranges or complete deafness, or losses at points between.<ref name=Mudd>{{cite web|last=Mudd|first=Pamela | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ototoxicity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/857679-overview|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=30 Nov 2011}}</ref>  It may present with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms, or asymmetrically, with one ear developing the condition after the other or not at all.<ref name=Mudd/> The time frames for progress of the disease vary greatly and symptoms of hearing loss may be temporary or permanent.<ref name=Farlex/>\n\nThe [[vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] and [[semi-circular canal]] are inner-ear components that comprise the vestibular system. Together they detect all directions of head movement. Two types of [[otolith organs]] are housed in the vestibule: the [[saccule]], which points vertically and detects vertical acceleration, and the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]], which points horizontally and detects horizontal acceleration. The otolith organs together sense the head\u2019s position with respect to gravity when the body is static; then the head\u2019s movement when it tilts; and pitch changes during any linear motion of the head. The saccule and utricle detect different motions, which information the brain receives and integrates to determine where the head is and how and where it is moving.\n\nThe semi-circular canals are three bony structures filled with fluid. As with the vestibule, the primary purpose of the canals is to detect movement. Each canal is oriented at right angles to the others, enabling detection of movement in any plane. The posterior canal detects rolling motion, or motion about the X axis; the anterior canal detects pitch, or motion about the Y axis; the horizontal canal detects yaw motion, or motion about the Z axis. \nWhen a medication is toxic in the vestibule or the semi-circular canals, the patient senses loss of balance or orientation rather than losses in hearing. Symptoms in these organs present as vertigo, difficulties walking in low light and darkness, disequilibrium, oscillopsia among others.<ref name=Mudd/> Each of these problems is related to balance and the mind is confused with the direction of motion or lack of motion. Both the vestibule and semi-circular canals transmit information to the brain about movement; when these are poisoned, they are unable to function properly which results in miscommunication with the brain.\n\nWhen the vestibule and/or semi-circular canals are affected by ototoxicity, the eye can also be affected. [[Nystagmus]] and [[oscillopsia]] are two conditions that overlap the vestibular and ocular systems. These symptoms cause the patient to have difficulties with seeing and processing images. The body subconsciously tries to compensate for the imbalance signals being sent to the brain by trying to obtain visual cues to support the information it is receiving. This results in that dizziness and \"woozy\" feeling patients use to describe conditions such as oscillopsia and vertigo.<ref name=Mudd/>\n\n[[Cranial nerve VIII]] is the least affected component of the ear when ototoxicity arises, but if the nerve is affected, the damage is most often permanent. Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage, including tinnitus, ringing of the ears, difficulty walking, deafness, and balance and orientation issues.\n\n==Ototoxic agents==\n\n===Antibiotics===\nAntibiotics in the [[aminoglycoside]] class, such as [[gentamicin]] and [[tobramycin]], may produce cochleotoxicity through a poorly understood mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid16549744\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobie RA, Black FO, Pezsnecker SC, Stallings VL | title = Hearing loss in patients with vestibulotoxic reactions to gentamicin therapy | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 132 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u20137 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16549744 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.132.3.253 }}</ref> It may result from antibiotic binding to [[NMDA receptor]]s in the [[cochlea]] and damaging [[neuron]]s through [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name=\"pmid8946832\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Basile AS, Huang JM, Xie C, Webster D, Berlin C, Skolnick P | title = N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists limit aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hearing loss | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 1338\u201343 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8946832 | doi = 10.1038/nm1296-1338 }}</ref> Aminoglycoside-induced production of [[reactive oxygen species]] may also injure cells of the [[cochlea]].<ref name=\"pmid12053140\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WJ, Sha SH, Schacht J | title = Recent advances in understanding aminoglycoside ototoxicity and its prevention | journal = Audiology and Neuro-Otology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 171\u20134 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12053140 | doi = 10.1159/000058305 }}</ref> Once-daily dosing<ref name=\"pmid8722531\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Munckhof WJ, Grayson ML, Turnidge JD | title = A meta-analysis of studies on the safety and efficacy of aminoglycosides given either once daily or as divided doses | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 645\u201363 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8722531 | doi = 10.1093/jac/37.4.645 }}</ref> and co-administration of [[N-acetylcysteine|''N''-acetylcysteine]]<ref name=\"pmid17653228\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tepel M | title = N-Acetylcysteine in the prevention of ototoxicity | journal = Kidney International | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 231\u20132 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17653228 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ki.5002299 }}</ref> may protect against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.

{"title_page": "Willem Weertman", "text_new": "'''Willem Weertman''' is an [[United States|American]] engineer known for his work as an engineer at [[Chrysler]] Corporation, where he was actively involved in the creation of many of the company's most famous engines, including the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]], [[Chrysler K engine|2.2 four]], and [[Chrysler LA engine|LA V8 (318, 360)]].  He graduated from [[Yale University]] with a bachelor of engineering degree in 1947 before joining the Chrysler Institute of Engineering; in 1949 he started work at the Plymouth Assembly Plant before spending 1950\u20131952 with the Navy in the [[Korean War]]. In 1954 Weertman became the first resident engineer for the Plymouth Mound Road V8 engine plant, which started producing A-engines in 1955. In December 1955, Weertman was promoted up to the Engine Design Department of Chrysler's Central Engineering department and assigned a title of Manager - Engine Design. In this capacity he worked on the [[Chrysler B engine]] and [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]], which would become known for its durability and at the time was considered to have high performance for its size. Valiants powered by this engine took first through seventh place in the first and only NASCAR sanctioned compact-car race.<ref>{{cite web|title=The slant six Hyper-Pak|author=\"Jerry Engle\"|url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/hyper-pak.html|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of these engines, Weertman was promoted to Assistant Chief Engineer-Engine Design. He worked on the successful adaptation of the [[Chrysler A engine]] to a new lightweight casting design, which incorporated other improvements as well, and was designed the [[Chrysler LA engine]]; this series was made from 1964 through 1993, with a major redesign during those years resulting in SMPI \"Magnum\" engines which continued until 2002, while a racing engine based on the design is still made, as is the derivative V-10 all-alloy engine which is in every [[Dodge Viper]] to this day. An iron V-10 was available for HD pickup trucks, filling in for the B and RB engines which were discontinued after 1978. Weertman also had a major influence on the overhead valve straight-six engines made and sold in Australia known as the [[Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine|Hemi Six]] Originally destined for US light truck duty (which never happened), these engines were designed primarily for performance and light weight; a Valiant Charger equipped with the largest of the Hemi Sixes was actually faster than the same car powered by a larger V8 engine, and set a local-production acceleration record that endured until 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chrysler Valiants, Valiant Chargers, Valiant Pacers, and other cars of Chrysler Australia|url=http://valiant.org/ausval.html|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this, Weertman was promoted to Chief Engineer - Engine Design and Development, a position which he held until retirement. From this point he worked mainly on four cylinder engines, as well as a V6 adaptation of the successful LA design for the [[Dodge Dakota]]. Willem Weertman retired from Chrysler Corporation after forty years but remained active, producing a 400-page book covering every engine made by Chrysler from 1922 until the company was taken over in 1998, \"Chrysler Engines 1922-1998,\" published by the Society of Automotive Engineers.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Relevant Links==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Weertman\n  | first = Willem\n  | title = Chrysler Engines 1922-1998\n  | publisher = SAE International\n  | year = 2008\n  | location = Warrendale, PA\n  | pages = 419\n  | isbn = 978-0-7680-1642-0}}\n*  {{cite web|title=Willem Weertman - Chrysler engine creator - personal and engine chronology|publisher=Allpar|url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/bios/weertman-chron.html|accessdate=2008-05-29}}\n* {{cite web|title=Willem Weertman - Chrysler Chief Engineer, Engine Design and Development (Interview)|publisher=allpar|url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/bios/weertman.html|accessdate=2008-05-29}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weertman, Willem}}\n[[Category:Chrysler executives]]\n[[Category:21st-century American engineers]]\n[[Category:People in the automobile industry]]\n[[Category:American people of Dutch descent]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "text_old": "'''Willem Weertman''' is an [[United States|American]] engineer known for his work as an engineer at [[Chrysler]] Corporation, where he was actively involved in the creation of many of the company's most famous engines, including the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|Slant Six]], [[Chrysler K engine|2.2 four]], and [[Chrysler LA engine|LA V8 (318, 360)]].
