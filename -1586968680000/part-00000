The extent of the Provisional Government's day-to-day management of affairs for Azad Hind is not entirely well-documented, so their specific functions as government officials for the state outside their positions as support ministers for Subhas Chandra Bose is not entirely certain.\n\n==Recognition==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}\n[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, participants left to right: [[Ba Maw]], [[Zhang Jinghui]], [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hideki Tojo]], [[Wan Waithayakon]], [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].]]\nAzad Hind was recognised as a legitimate state by only a small number of countries limited solely to Axis powers and their allies. Azad Hind had diplomatic relations with nine countries: [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Italian Social Republic]], [[Independent State of Croatia]] and [[Wang Jingwei Government]], [[Thailand in World War II|Thailand]], the [[State of Burma]], [[Manchukuo]] and the [[Second Philippine Republic]]. On the declaration of its formation in occupied Singapore the [[Taoiseach|Taoiseach of Ireland]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], sent a note of congratulations to Bose. [[Vichy France]], however, although being an Axis collaborator, never gave formal political recognition to Azad Hind. This government participated as an observer in the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943.\n\n==Government administration and World War II==\n{{Main|Indian National Army|India during World War II|Invasion and Occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II}}\nThe same night that Bose declared the existence of Azad Hind, the government took action to declare war against the United States and Britain. The government consisted of a Cabinet ministry acting as an advisory board to Subhas Bose, who was given the title \"Netaji\" (translating roughly to \"leader\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}) and was no doubt the dominant figure in the Provisional Government. He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} and the army.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} With regards to the government's first issuances of war declarations, the \"Cabinet had not been unanimous about the inclusion of the U.S.A. Bose had shown impatience and displeasure \u2013 there was never any question then or later of his absolute authority: the Cabinet had no responsibility and could only tender advice...\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAt the end of October 1943, Bose flew to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference as an observer to Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]; it could not function as a delegate because India had technically fallen outside the jurisdiction of Japan's definition of \"Greater East Asia\", but Bose gave speeches in opposition to Western colonialism and imperialism at the conference. By the end of the conference, Azad Hind had been given a limited form of governmental jurisdiction over the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], which had been captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] early on in the war.\n\n[[File:Azadhindpostage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azad Hind Stamps|Unreleased postage stamps]] of the Azad Hind government.]]\nOnce under the jurisdiction of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government's first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed \"Shaheed\" and \"Swaraj\", meaning \"martyr\" and \"self-rule\" respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of [[Lt Col A. D Loganathan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yorozubp.com/netaji/75birthday/dhillon.htm |title=The Last Straw That Broke the Back of the British Empire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605082123/http://www.yorozubp.com/netaji/75birthday/dhillon.htm |archivedate=5 June 2003}}</ref> and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the [[Indian National Army]], ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its course of actions and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in southeast Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory, the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice, they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first but became less inclined to do so towards the end of the war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war, Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands' vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest, he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the [[Homfreyganj massacre]] of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the [[Indian Independence League]], whose leader in [[Port Blair]], Dr. Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the [[Cellular Jail]] after doing his best to protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.<ref>Dasgupta, Jayant (2002) ''Japanese in Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

Delhi: Eastern Book Corporation. pp. 249-51.</ref>\n\nAzad Hind's military forces in the form of the INA saw some successes against the British and moved with the Japanese army to lay siege to the town of [[Imphal]] in eastern India. Plans to march towards [[Delhi]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season and the failure to capture Imphal. British [[bombing]] seriously reduced morale, and the Japanese along with the INA forces began their withdrawal from India.\n\nIn addition to these setbacks, the INA was faced with a formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend [[Rangoon]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944\u20131945. Loganathan was relocated from the Andaman Islands to act as field commander. With the INA garrison about 6,000 strong, he manned the Burmese capital in the absence of any other police force or troops during the period between the departure of the Japanese and the arrival of the British. He was successful in maintaining law and order to the extent that there was not a single reported case of [[dacoit]]y or of looting during the period from 24 April to 4 May 1945.\n\n==Indian areas under the administration of the Provisional Government==\nAlmost all of the territory of the Provisional Government lay in the Andaman Islands, although the Provisional Government was allowed some authority over Indian enclaves in Japanese-occupied territories. Provisional Government civil authority was never enacted in areas occupied by the INA; instead, Japanese military authority prevailed and responsibility for administration of occupied areas of India was shared between the Japanese and the Indian forces.\n\n==The defeat of the INA and the collapse of the Provisional Government==\nLeft to defend{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Rangoon from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated. Bose was suggested to leave Burma to continue his struggle for Indian independence and returned to Singapore before the fall of Rangoon; the government Azad Hind had established on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands collapsed when the island garrisons of Japanese and Indian troops were defeated by British troops and the islands themselves retaken. Allegedly Bose himself was killed in a plane crash departing from [[Taiwan]] attempting to escape to [[Russia]]. The Provisional Government of Free India ceased to exist with the deaths of the Axis, the INA, and disappearance of Bose in 1945.\n\nThe troops who manned the brigades of the Indian National Army were taken as [[prisoners of war]] by the British. A number of these prisoners were brought to India and tried by British courts for treason, including a number of high-ranking officers such as [[Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon|Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon]]. The defence of these individuals from [[prosecution]] by the British became a central point of contention between the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian Independence Movement]] in the post-war years.\n\n==Relations with Japan and view of Azad Hind as Axis collaborator==\n[[File:Bose Gandhi 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Bose with Gandhi in 1938]]\nSince [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] pragmatically aligned with Japan to liberate India, British propaganda tried to portray him as a controversial figure for his official stance against [[imperialism]] which would run in opposition against what British propaganda portrayed as Japanese imperialism in Asia during World War II. Bose himself opposed all manner of colonial practices but saw Britain as [[hypocritical]] in \"fighting a war for democracy\" but refusing to extend the same respect for democracy and equal rights to their colonial subjects in India. Bose opposed [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|British racial policy]] and declared [[Greater East Asia Conference#Joint Declaration|working for the abolition of racial discrimination]] with [[Burma|Burmese]], Japanese and other Asians. British propaganda accused him of fascism, citing his control over the Provisional Government as strict as evidence of this; and further tried to portray him wanting to establish a [[totalitarian]] state in India with the blessings of the Axis powers. It is accurate to term Bose solely as a fascist, as he believed that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for India immediately after independence and that a centrally organised, self-sufficient, semi-socialist India under the firm control of a single party was the best course for Indian government. Some of his ideas would help shape Indian governmental policy in the aftermath of the country's independence from Britain.\n\nThe fact that Azad Hind was aligned politically with Japan may have little to do with explicit agreement and support for Japanese policy in Asia, and more with what Bose saw as a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] approach to Indian independence. Disillusioned with [[Gandhi]]'s philosophies of non-violence, Bose was clearly of the camp that supported exploiting British weakness to gain Indian independence. Throughout the existence of Azad Hind, Bose sought to distance himself from Japanese collaboration and become more self-sufficient but found this difficult since the existence of Azad Hind as a governmental entity had only come about with the support of the Japanese, on whom the government and army of Azad Hind were entirely dependent. Bose, however, remains a hero in present-day India and is remembered as a man who fought fiercely for Indian independence.<ref>[http://sarvadharma.org/Museum/heroes/subbose.htm]</ref>\n\nAlthough Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the [[Battle of Imphal]]. On 18 April 1944 the suicide squads led by Col. Shaukat Malik broke through the British defence and captured [[Moirang]] in Manipur. The Azad Hind administration took control of this independent Indian territory.<ref>''The Hindustan Times'' {{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting9.htm |title=Hindustan Times \u2013 Archive News |accessdate=8 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014458/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting9.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref> Following Moirang, the advancing INA breached the Kohima road, posing a threat to the British positions in both [[Silchar]] and [[Kohima]]. Col. Gulzara Singh's column had penetrated 250 miles into India. The Azad Brigade advanced, by outflanking the Anglo-American positions.\n\nHowever, INA's most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA's and the Japanese bid to take [[Imphal]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nWith the siege of Imphal failing, the Japanese began to shift priority for resource allocation from South Asia to the Pacific, where they were fighting United States troops advancing from island to island against Japanese holdings there. When it had become clear that Bose's plans to advance to Delhi from the borders of Burma would never materialise due to the defeat of the INA at [[Imphal]] and the halt of Japanese armies by British [[Air force|aerial]] and later [[naval]] superiority in the region, Japanese support for Azad Hind declined.\n\n==Contributions to Indian independence==\nThe true extent to which the INA's activities influenced the decision to leave India is mirrored by the views of [[Clement Attlee]], the British prime minister at the time of India's Independence. Attlee cites several reasons, the most important of which were the INA activities of Subhas Chandra Bose, which weakened the very foundation of the British Empire in India, and the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] which made the British realise that the support of the Indian armed forces could no longer be relied upon.<ref>Majumdar, R.C.

Sarkar \u2013 the government's official Legal Advisor\n\nAll of these Secretaries and Advisory officials held Ministerial rank in the Provisional Government. The extent of the Provisional Government's day-to-day management of affairs for Azad Hind is not entirely well-documented, so their specific functions as government officials for the state outside their positions as support ministers for Subhas Chandra Bose is not entirely certain.\n\n==Recognition==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}\n[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, participants left to right: [[Ba Maw]], [[Zhang Jinghui]], [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hideki Tojo]], [[Wan Waithayakon]], [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].]]\nAzad Hind was recognised as a legitimate state by only a small number of countries limited solely to Axis powers and their allies. Azad Hind had diplomatic relations with nine countries: [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Italian Social Republic]], [[Independent State of Croatia]] and [[Wang Jingwei Government]], [[Thailand in World War II|Thailand]], the [[State of Burma]], [[Manchukuo]] and the [[Second Philippine Republic]]. On the declaration of its formation in occupied Singapore the [[Taoiseach|Taoiseach of Ireland]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], sent a note of congratulations to Bose. [[Vichy France]], however, although being an Axis collaborator, never gave formal political recognition to Azad Hind. This government participated as an observer in the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943.\n\n==Government administration and World War II==\n{{Main|Indian National Army|India during World War II|Invasion and Occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II}}\nThe same night that Bose declared the existence of Azad Hind, the government took action to declare war against the United States and Britain. The government consisted of a Cabinet ministry acting as an advisory board to Subhas Bose, who was given the title \"Netaji\" (translating roughly to \"leader\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}) and was no doubt the dominant figure in the Provisional Government. He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} and the army.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} With regards to the government's first issuances of war declarations, the \"Cabinet had not been unanimous about the inclusion of the U.S.A. Bose had shown impatience and displeasure \u2013 there was never any question then or later of his absolute authority: the Cabinet had no responsibility and could only tender advice...\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAt the end of October 1943, Bose flew to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference as an observer to Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]; it could not function as a delegate because India had technically fallen outside the jurisdiction of Japan's definition of \"Greater East Asia\", but Bose gave speeches in opposition to Western colonialism and imperialism at the conference. By the end of the conference, Azad Hind had been given a limited form of governmental jurisdiction over the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], which had been captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] early on in the war.\n\n[[File:Azadhindpostage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azad Hind Stamps|Unreleased postage stamps]] of the Azad Hind government.]]\nOnce under the jurisdiction of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government's first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed \"Shaheed\" and \"Swaraj\", meaning \"martyr\" and \"self-rule\" respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of [[Lt Col A. D Loganathan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yorozubp.com/netaji/75birthday/dhillon.htm |title=The Last Straw That Broke the Back of the British Empire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605082123/http://www.yorozubp.com/netaji/75birthday/dhillon.htm |archivedate=5 June 2003}}</ref> and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the [[Indian National Army]], ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its course of actions and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in southeast Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory, the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice, they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first but became less inclined to do so towards the end of the war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war, Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands' vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest, he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the [[Homfreyganj massacre]] of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the [[Indian Independence League]], whose leader in [[Port Blair]], Dr. Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the [[Cellular Jail]] after doing his best to protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.<ref>Dasgupta, Jayant (2002) ''Japanese in Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

Delhi: Eastern Book Corporation. pp. 249-51.</ref>\n\nAzad Hind's military forces in the form of the INA saw some successes against the British and moved with the Japanese army to lay siege to the town of [[Imphal]] in eastern India. Plans to march towards [[Delhi]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season and the failure to capture Imphal. British [[bombing]] seriously reduced morale, and the Japanese along with the INA forces began their withdrawal from India.\n\nIn addition to these setbacks, the INA was faced with a formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend [[Rangoon]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944\u20131945. Loganathan was relocated from the Andaman Islands to act as field commander. With the INA garrison about 6,000 strong, he manned the Burmese capital in the absence of any other police force or troops during the period between the departure of the Japanese and the arrival of the British. He was successful in maintaining law and order to the extent that there was not a single reported case of [[dacoit]]y or of looting during the period from 24 April to 4 May 1945.\n\n==Indian areas under the administration of the Provisional Government==\nAlmost all of the territory of the Provisional Government lay in the Andaman Islands, although the Provisional Government was allowed some authority over Indian enclaves in Japanese-occupied territories. Provisional Government civil authority was never enacted in areas occupied by the INA; instead, Japanese military authority prevailed and responsibility for administration of occupied areas of India was shared between the Japanese and the Indian forces.\n\n==The defeat of the INA and the collapse of the Provisional Government==\nLeft to defend{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Rangoon from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated. Bose was suggested to leave Burma to continue his struggle for Indian independence and returned to Singapore before the fall of Rangoon; the government Azad Hind had established on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands collapsed when the island garrisons of Japanese and Indian troops were defeated by British troops and the islands themselves retaken. Allegedly Bose himself was killed in a plane crash departing from [[Taiwan]] attempting to escape to [[Russia]]. The Provisional Government of Free India ceased to exist with the deaths of the Axis, the INA, and disappearance of Bose in 1945.\n\nThe troops who manned the brigades of the Indian National Army were taken as [[prisoners of war]] by the British. A number of these prisoners were brought to India and tried by British courts for treason, including a number of high-ranking officers such as [[Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon|Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon]]. The defence of these individuals from [[prosecution]] by the British became a central point of contention between the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian Independence Movement]] in the post-war years.\n\n==Relations with Japan and view of Azad Hind as Axis collaborator==\n[[File:Bose Gandhi 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Bose with Gandhi in 1938]]\nSince [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] pragmatically aligned with Japan to liberate India, British propaganda tried to portray him as a controversial figure for his official stance against [[imperialism]] which would run in opposition against what British propaganda portrayed as Japanese imperialism in Asia during World War II. Bose himself opposed all manner of colonial practices but saw Britain as [[hypocritical]] in \"fighting a war for democracy\" but refusing to extend the same respect for democracy and equal rights to their colonial subjects in India. Bose opposed [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|British racial policy]] and declared [[Greater East Asia Conference#Joint Declaration|working for the abolition of racial discrimination]] with [[Burma|Burmese]], Japanese and other Asians. British propaganda accused him of fascism, citing his control over the Provisional Government as strict as evidence of this; and further tried to portray him wanting to establish a [[totalitarian]] state in India with the blessings of the Axis powers. It is accurate to term Bose solely as a fascist, as he believed that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for India immediately after independence and that a centrally organised, self-sufficient, semi-socialist India under the firm control of a single party was the best course for Indian government. Some of his ideas would help shape Indian governmental policy in the aftermath of the country's independence from Britain.\n\nThe fact that Azad Hind was aligned politically with Japan may have little to do with explicit agreement and support for Japanese policy in Asia, and more with what Bose saw as a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] approach to Indian independence. Disillusioned with [[Gandhi]]'s philosophies of non-violence, Bose was clearly of the camp that supported exploiting British weakness to gain Indian independence. Throughout the existence of Azad Hind, Bose sought to distance himself from Japanese collaboration and become more self-sufficient but found this difficult since the existence of Azad Hind as a governmental entity had only come about with the support of the Japanese, on whom the government and army of Azad Hind were entirely dependent. Bose, however, remains a hero in present-day India and is remembered as a man who fought fiercely for Indian independence.<ref>[http://sarvadharma.org/Museum/heroes/subbose.htm]</ref>\n\nAlthough Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the [[Battle of Imphal]]. On 18 April 1944 the suicide squads led by Col. Shaukat Malik broke through the British defence and captured [[Moirang]] in Manipur. The Azad Hind administration took control of this independent Indian territory.<ref>''The Hindustan Times'' {{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting9.htm |title=Hindustan Times \u2013 Archive News |accessdate=8 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014458/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting9.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref> Following Moirang, the advancing INA breached the Kohima road, posing a threat to the British positions in both [[Silchar]] and [[Kohima]]. Col. Gulzara Singh's column had penetrated 250 miles into India. The Azad Brigade advanced, by outflanking the Anglo-American positions.\n\nHowever, INA's most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA's and the Japanese bid to take [[Imphal]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nWith the siege of Imphal failing, the Japanese began to shift priority for resource allocation from South Asia to the Pacific, where they were fighting United States troops advancing from island to island against Japanese holdings there. When it had become clear that Bose's plans to advance to Delhi from the borders of Burma would never materialise due to the defeat of the INA at [[Imphal]] and the halt of Japanese armies by British [[Air force|aerial]] and later [[naval]] superiority in the region, Japanese support for Azad Hind declined.\n\n==Contributions to Indian independence==\nThe true extent to which the INA's activities influenced the decision to leave India is mirrored by the views of [[Clement Attlee]], the British prime minister at the time of India's Independence. Attlee cites several reasons, the most important of which were the INA activities of Subhas Chandra Bose, which weakened the very foundation of the British Empire in India, and the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] which made the British realise that the support of the Indian armed forces could no longer be relied upon.<ref>Majumdar, R.C.

It is the story of Saba ([[Mahira Khan]]) and the struggles she faces due to being in love with her best friend and cousin Irtiza ([[Humayun Saeed]]). From the very first episode it is established that Saba is madly in love with Irtiza, who she has grown up with. It is also established that Irtiza also cares a lot for Saba, and both have a very close bond. Saba is an extrovert, who lives life to the fullest, and expects Irtiza to fulfil all her childish demands. Irtiza happily does everything Saba asks for, and feels happy seeing her happy.\n\nThe story starts with Saba and Irtiza celebrating Eid, and enjoying their life in Pakistan. Soon after Irtiza decides to go to America for post-graduate studies. Saba is unhappy hearing about this and gets angry at Irtiza. Irtiza reasons with Saba and tells her that he will be back in 2 years. Saba understands that post-graduate studies is important for his career and agrees for him to go. Irtiza goes to America and whilst studying there develops feelings for his cousin Saman ([[Armeena Khan]]).\n\nAfter completing his studies he comes back to Pakistan and Saba is extremely happy to see him. Soon Saman's parents die in a plane crash, and Saman comes to Pakistan along with Irtiza to her extended family for emotional support, Saba and Irtiza take care of her. Soon Saba learns that Saman is not her cousin, but her elder sister,  and that Saman was adopted by her uncle when she was a baby. This fact brings Saba and Saman closer to each other. Both Saman and Saba start sharing a very close sisterly bond. Until one day Saba realises that both Saman and Irtiza have feelings for each other. In spite of loving her sister she cannot help but feel jealousy and anger.\n\nSoon after Saba's realisation, Irtiza proposes marriage to Saman. Saba is heartbroken seeing this, but she collects herself and tries her best to be happy for her best friend and her sister. Saba happily participates in all wedding rituals, however Saba loses all patience when she finally sees Saman and Irtiza making their wedding vows. In the heat of the moment Saba goes off in a separate room and in a state of anger and shock curses Saman and wishes for the fact that she dies! Saba curses Saman and says that Saman should have died in that plane accident with the parents who adopted her, and she can still die! Why did she come here to ruin her life! Saba's Grandmother who is aware of the situation tells Saba to calm down but in vain!\n\nThe next morning Saba feels guilty about what she said about Saman, and apologises to her Grandma. After the marriage, Saba keeps a distance from Irtiza, Irtiza notices Saba's behaviour and questions her on a number of occasions. Saba also starts changing from a very full of life person to a very serious person, Irtiza again observes this and does not seem to like this change in her.\n\nAfter a while Irtiza and Saman go back to America and settle there for sometime. Saman gets pregnant and tells Saba about it, Saba gets very happy about the news and congratulates Saman. Irtiza and Saman decide to call Saba to America. Saba is very hesitant to go and meet them as she still has feelings for Irtiza, she politely declines, but is forced by the family to go and stay with them and help Saman while she is pregnant.\n\nSaba goes to America. Whilst she enjoys the company of her sister, she again feels very helpless, as her feelings for Irtiza do not die. Irtiza's concern for Saba and his friendliness does not help her helplessness either. One day Saba, Saman and Irtiza go for a party, there in the party a guy named Amir ([[Adnan Malik]])\nstarts to develop feelings for Saba. After the party, on a number of occasions the Amir comes over to Irtiza and Saman's place to try and meet Saba. Both Saman and Irtiza are overjoyed, and feel that the guy will be a great match for her. One day Irtiza sits Saba down and asks her if she is interested in marrying the guy, and she can tell him if she has feelings for him, Saba loses her patience and rudely reverts stating that he has no business meddling in her personal life and he should stay away! This behaviour of Saba makes Irtiza upset, for which later Saba also apologises!\n\nSoon Saman delivers a baby boy and Irtiza and her name him Maaz. Saba goes back to Pakistan. A few years pass and Saba does not accept the proposal of Amir, Irtiza feels disappointed, where else Saman tries to understand why Saba does not have any love interest in her life.\n\nSaman and Irtiza go to Pakistan for holidays with Maaz. Saman tells Saba that Amir is now getting married, Saba does not seem concerned and says \"congrats,\" Saman asks Saba about why she did not want to marry him? to which Saba replies \"He is not the person she can see her life with!\" Soon after she says this it starts raining, and Saba gets excited and carries Maaz out to the rain, and both of them start enjoying dancing in the rain! Saman closely observes Saba enjoying and dancing in the rain, and suddenly it hits her that even Irtiza loves the rain a lot! After which she starts reminiscing and realises that Saba has been in love with Irtiza all this while! Thinking this Saman feels quite guilty!\n\nThe next day it is Maaz's birthday, and Irtiza, Saman and Saba go out to the mall to shop for Maaz's birthday party. Irtiza goes inside the mall to buy Maaz's cake, and Saman gets excited seeing flowers, she tells Saba to wait for her in the car and she will get the flowers, Saba stops her and tells her that Irtiza can get the flowers, but she does not listen and heads off, when Saman is returning from getting the flowers she is hit by a car in front of Saba's eyes! Saba runs to Saman to see her covered in blood! Irtiza and Saba call the ambulance. Whilst Saman is being taken to the hospital, she tells Saba that she is sorry, and now both Irtiza and Maaz are hers, when Saba hears this she gets very anxious, and tells the driver of the ambulance to drive faster! However Saman does not survive the hit and run!\n\nSaba is shown to be extremely guilt ridden and broken down after the accident. She keeps on getting flashbacks of Saman getting rammed in by the car coupled with the voice over of her cursing \"she should have died\" Saba feels that she is responsible for Saman's death as she cursed her on her wedding. Saba is completely broken but develops a very strong bond with Maaz.\n\nSoon the Grandmother feels that it would be good if Saba gets married to Irtiza, as this will benefit Irtiza and Maaz, as they are lonely, and it will also benefit Saba since she has always been in love with him. Saba gets very angry hearing this proposal, as she is extremely guilt ridden, and says that she will never marry Irtiza! When Irtiza is asked about the same proposal, he outright rejects it stating that Saba deserves a much better man, and not a man who was married and has a kid, and that he cannot even think like this. Irtiza soon realises that Saba is angry with him due to the proposal, Irtiza talks with Saba and reasons with her! He tells her that he cannot even think of marrying her in his dreams and that he wants the best man for her, and he is not the best, he also says that he loves her a lot, and to not be angry with him! Saba does not seem to care much for what Irtiza says, and says \"she is not angry with him\" and leaves.\n\nSoon after Saba gets a proposal for marriage. Saba does not care to meet the man in question, and says \"yes.\" Soon Saba is married off to him. On the wedding night the man in question confesses to Saba that he is already married and has a wife and a child in America, and that he married her due to family pressure, and no matter what he can never give her the love and the importance of a wife. Strangely Saba accepts this, and tells him that she is absolutely fine with this arrangement and that she will not be telling her parents about it, which gets the man quite confused. Soon the man leaves for America, leaving Saba behind.\n\nSaba stays back in Pakistan, and Irtiza starts getting concerned about why Saba is not going to America, and why is her visa taking so much time. He confronts Saba about it on a number of occasions but Saba rudely reverts stating that such things take time, and to not interfere in her personal matters. Irtiza's concern for Saba starts growing and he decides to take matters in his own hands, one day he goes to America for a business trip and goes to meet the husband there, where he sees him with his wife and children! Irtiza gets angry seeing this and starts insulting the husband, after which the husband tells Irtiza that Saba always knew about this, and that no one had stopped her from telling you guys! Irtiza gets angry hearing this!\n\nIrtiza goes back to Pakistan and tells the family about Saba's husband 's second wife and children! He confronts Saba and gets angry with her for keeping them in the dark about this! Soon out of family pressure Saba divorces her husband and goes back home!

Saba gets extremely bitter with Irtiza, and tells him that she is no longer friends with him and to leave her alone! Irtiza is upset hearing this and tells her that he has always wanted the best for her, so how can she think about him like this?\n\nSaba's parents are concerned about Saba's future and become depressed. Soon Saba gets another proposal from a divorcee who is 20 years older than her and has two kids! Hearing this Irtiza gets very angry and tells Saba's father off for even paying heed to such a proposal! Saba's father explains to Irtiza that Saba will not be getting very good proposals anymore as she herself is a divorcee! Irtiza gets upset hearing this! One day Irtiza sees Saba's mother crying and stating what bad did her daughter did, and why is her life so difficult, Irtza hearing this tells Saba's mother that he wants to marry Saba! He also states that he cannot see Saba ruining her life anymore!\n\nSaba becomes infuriated upon learning that Irtiza has proposed marriage, she then confronts Irtiza. Irtiza listens to her anger but does not change his decision. Soon Saba's grandmother gets sick due to seeing Saba in such a state, she tells Saba to marry Irtiza, Saba agrees to the marriage half-heartedly!\n\nSaba and Irtiza marry in an intimate ceremony. but afterwards, Saba changes little and continues to isolate. Saba's parents are upset watching their daughter's condition. One day Irtiza loses his patience and forces Saba to come downstairs to his room. Saba gets furious and tells him off, and tells him that he has no right to humiliate her like this! Irtiza replies that he cannot see the family suffer like this, so please at least for their sake at least pretend to be happy with this marriage! He further tells Saba that she knows him for years, and that she should trust him enough to know that he will never force himself on her, Saba agrees to his request and tells him that she can pretend to be happy with this marriage for the family's sake.\n\nSoon Saba softens and begins to participate in family activities, to the delight of her parents. Irtiza then one day announces that he needs to go to America for a month or two for business. The family tell Irtiza that Saba should also go along with him! Saba tries to protest but in vain!\n\nBoth Saba and Irtiza go to America. Upon landing in America and in the house where Saman and Irtiza used to live, Saba starts to feel very disturbed! To the extent of nearly fainting, Irtiza observes this and helps her! Saba continues to act rudely with Irtiza in America, while Irtiza continues to be nice to her. Slowly Saba soften ups and starts going out with irtiza for outings. Irtiza starts to develop feelings for Saba, and tries his best to bring out the same chirpy Saba that she used to be!\n\nOne evening Irtiza finds Saba sleeping on the couch, he puts a blanket on her and observes her sleeping, soon Saba wakes up, and politely smiles at him, Irtiza looks deep into her eyes and holds her hands, which makes Saba very uncomfortable! Saba walks up to leave, but Irtiza stops her by holding her arm, Saba gets furious and starts shouting at Irtiza! And tells him point blank that she does not want to see his face, and why is that so hard for him to understand? Irtiza gets very hurt and angry hearing this and tells her that after they go back to Pakistan he will make the kind of arrangements that Saba will hardly have to see him at all! He gets angry and leaves, leaving Saba upset and anxious about hurting Irtiza!\n\nAfter the incident Saba tries hard to communicate with Irtiza, but in vain! One day Saba gets through to Irtiza and tells him to come early from work as she feels extremely lonely here all alone, Irtiza softens up and tells her that he will be back by 5pm. Irtiza leaves for office, after which a friend comes to meet him and tells him to visit a construction site with him. Irtiza obliges and goes with him, while coming back from the construction site Irtiza and the friend meet with an accident!\n\nSaba continues to wait for Irtiza at home, soon she gets a phone call informing her about the car accident, Saba gets extremely disturbed by the news and starts anxiously shivering, in the morning Saba hears a car pulling up in the driveway and she runs and finds Irtiza there! As soon as Saba sees Irtiza she starts pushing him, and starts hitting him, she yells at him and says \"Where have you been! You told me you will be home by the evening!\" Irtiza tries to explain that he met with an accident, Saba gets more hyper after hearing this and says \"All of you guys are planning to leave me, first Saman left and now even you are planning to leave me, all of you guys want to leave me here all alone!\" She gets hyper and starts shoving him, Irtiza loses his cool and holds her and shouts \"I am going nowhere! I am here with you!\"\n\nSaba and Irtiza return home. Saba confesses everything. She starts by telling him that she has loved him for years and if anything ever happens to him she will die. She then further starts confessing that it is because of this love she feels so guilty, because it is because of this love she cursed her sister and she is no longer in this world. She cries her heart out and blames Irtiza for always taking so much care of her. And always being there for her. And because of this she fell in love with him so deeply. She cries and questions him! \"Why did you care for me so much?\" After the confession Saba passes out and Irtiza lays her on the couch to sleep.\n\nWhile Saba is sleeping, Irtiza watches her, and remember all that Saba has confessed and has tears in his eyes! Soon after when Saba wakes up, Irtiza tells Saba that he has always cared for her, because he has always loved her! Seeing her happy has always been his priority in his life! He says that the love he has felt for her all these years is very pure, it is the kind of love that is not selfish but selfless, this love only wants to see her happy, the love he has for her cannot be shaken up no matter how rude she is with him, no matter what she does, he can never hate her, he says \"You expect me to hate you, but someone who has loved you all their life can never hate you! \" To which Saba replies that he lost his wife because of her! Irtiza tells her that no one can control destiny and life, and that she is not responsible for Saman's death! It is a bad incident that happened! And that she is not liable for it! He also says that he does not believe both of them have done any disservice to Saman! He further says that she needs to stop being ashamed of loving him, because no matter how much the try their love for each other can never die! Both Saba and Irtiza hug each other. Later they are shown to live happily ever after!\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Main Cast===\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Irtaza Muzaffar\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Saba Shafiq \n* [[Armeena Rana Khan]] as Saman Shafiq\n\n===Recurring Cast===\n* [[Adnan Malik]] as Aamir\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Shafiq (Saba and Saman's father)\n* [[Zeba Bakhtiar]] as Maliha Shafiq (Saba and Saman's mother) \n* [[Jahanzeb Khan]] as Zafar \n* [[Junaid Khan (singer)|Junaid Khan]] as Safir \n* Azra Mansoor as Saba and Saman's dadi\n* Aini Zaidi as Talat \n* Rashid Khawaja as Ansar (Maleeha's brother)\n* Aini Zaidi as Ansar's wife, Maleeha's sister-in-law\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Safeer's mother (young)\n* Arjumand Azhar as Javed\n* Shazia Naz as Sonia\n* Saima Kanwal as Safeer's mother (old)\n* Sonia Nayyar\n\n===Guest Cast===\n* [[Zaheen Tahira]] as Rehmat Bi\n* [[Faiza Hassan]] as Singer (episode 1)\n* [[Adeel Hussain]] as co-dancer in Ballay Ballay song\n* [[Saman Ansari]] as Hira Amir's sister (cameo)\n* [[Sidra Batool]] as Shiza (Saba's friend)\n\n== Production ==\n===Development=== \nIn 2013, it was announced that a drama series is being developed based on [[Farhat Ishtiaq]]'s novel ''[[Bin Roye Ansoo]]'', before the project went into [[development hell]] for almost half an year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bin Roye Starring Mahira Khan \u2013 Release Date & Official Poster |url=http://www.brandsynario.com/bin-roye-starring-mahira-khan-release-date-official-poster/|first=Yusra|last=Hussain|publisher=HIP|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> It was later revealed that ''Bin Roye'' will be released as a theatrical film and later on as TV series.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HUM Films presents BIN ROYE \u2013 the movie|url=http://blogs.humnetwork.com/hum-films-presents-bin-roye-the-movie/|last=Zarish| first=Gill|publisher=[[Hum TV]]|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Actor [[Humayun Saeed]] who played the lead role in film revealed, \"''Bin Roye'' is a romantic drama.

It is the story of Saba ([[Mahira Khan]]) and the struggles she faces due to being in love with her best friend and cousin Irtiza ([[Humayun Saeed]]). From the very first episode it is established that Saba is madly in love with Irtiza, who she has grown up with. It is also established that Irtiza also cares a lot for Saba, and both have a very close bond. Saba is an extrovert, who lives life to the fullest, and expects Irtiza to fulfil all her childish demands. Irtiza happily does everything Saba asks for, and feels happy seeing her happy.\n\nThe story starts with Saba and Irtiza celebrating Eid, and enjoying their life in Pakistan. Soon after Irtiza decides to go to America for post-graduate studies. Saba is unhappy hearing about this and gets angry at Irtiza. Irtiza reasons with Saba and tells her that he will be back in 2 years. Saba understands that post-graduate studies is important for his career and agrees for him to go. Irtiza goes to America and whilst studying there develops feelings for his cousin Saman ([[Armeena Khan]]).\n\nAfter completing his studies he comes back to Pakistan and Saba is extremely happy to see him. Soon Saman's parents die in a plane crash, and Saman comes to Pakistan along with Irtiza to her extended family for emotional support, Saba and Irtiza take care of her. Soon Saba learns that Saman is not her cousin, but her elder sister,  and that Saman was adopted by her uncle when she was a baby. This fact brings Saba and Saman closer to each other. Both Saman and Saba start sharing a very close sisterly bond. Until one day Saba realises that both Saman and Irtiza have feelings for each other. In spite of loving her sister she cannot help but feel jealousy and anger.\n\nSoon after Saba's realisation, Irtiza proposes marriage to Saman. Saba is heartbroken seeing this, but she collects herself and tries her best to be happy for her best friend and her sister. Saba happily participates in all wedding rituals, however Saba loses all patience when she finally sees Saman and Irtiza making their wedding vows. In the heat of the moment Saba goes off in a separate room and in a state of anger and shock curses Saman and wishes for the fact that she dies! Saba curses Saman and says that Saman should have died in that plane accident with the parents who adopted her, and she can still die! Why did she come here to ruin her life! Saba's Grandmother who is aware of the situation tells Saba to calm down but in vain!\n\nThe next morning Saba feels guilty about what she said about Saman, and apologises to her Grandma. After the marriage, Saba keeps a distance from Irtiza, Irtiza notices Saba's behaviour and questions her on a number of occasions. Saba also starts changing from a very full of life person to a very serious person, Irtiza again observes this and does not seem to like this change in her.\n\nAfter a while Irtiza and Saman go back to America and settle there for sometime. Saman gets pregnant and tells Saba about it, Saba gets very happy about the news and congratulates Saman. Irtiza and Saman decide to call Saba to America. Saba is very hesitant to go and meet them as she still has feelings for Irtiza, she politely declines, but is forced by the family to go and stay with them and help Saman while she is pregnant.\n\nSaba goes to America. Whilst she enjoys the company of her sister, she again feels very helpless, as her feelings for Irtiza do not die. Irtiza's concern for Saba and his friendliness does not help her helplessness either. One day Saba, Saman and Irtiza go for a party, there in the party a guy named Amir ([[Adnan Malik]])\nstarts to develop feelings for Saba. After the party, on a number of occasions the Amir comes over to Irtiza and Saman's place to try and meet Saba. Both Saman and Irtiza are overjoyed, and feel that the guy will be a great match for her. One day Irtiza sits Saba down and asks her if she is interested in marrying the guy, and she can tell him if she has feelings for him, Saba loses her patience and rudely reverts stating that he has no business meddling in her personal life and he should stay away! This behaviour of Saba makes Irtiza upset, for which later Saba also apologises!\n\nSoon Saman delivers a baby boy and Irtiza and her name him Maaz. Saba goes back to Pakistan. A few years pass and Saba does not accept the proposal of Amir, Irtiza feels disappointed, where else Saman tries to understand why Saba does not have any love interest in her life.\n\nSaman and Irtiza go to Pakistan for holidays with Maaz. Saman tells Saba that Amir is now getting married, Saba does not seem concerned and says \"congrats,\" Saman asks Saba about why she did not want to marry him? to which Saba replies \"He is not the person she can see her life with!\" Soon after she says this it starts raining, and Saba gets excited and carries Maaz out to the rain, and both of them start enjoying dancing in the rain! Saman closely observes Saba enjoying and dancing in the rain, and suddenly it hits her that even Irtiza loves the rain a lot! After which she starts reminiscing and realises that Saba has been in love with Irtiza all this while! Thinking this Saman feels quite guilty!\n\nThe next day it is Maaz's birthday, and Irtiza, Saman and Saba go out to the mall to shop for Maaz's birthday party. Irtiza goes inside the mall to get Maaz's cake, and Saman gets excited seeing flowers, she tells Saba to wait for her in the car and she will go get the flowers, Saba stops her and tells her that Irtiza can get the flowers, but she does not listen and heads off, when Saman is returning from getting the flowers she gets rammed in by a car in front of Saba's eyes! Saba runs to Saman to see her covered in blood! Irtiza and Saba call the ambulance. Whilst Saman is being taken to the hospital, she tells Saba that she is sorry, and now both Irtiza and Maaz are hers, when Saba hears this she gets very anxious, and tells the driver of the ambulance to drive faster! However Saman does not survive the hit and run!\n\nSaba is shown to be extremely guilt ridden and broken down after the accident. She keeps on getting flashbacks of Saman getting rammed in by the car coupled with the voice over of her cursing \"she should have died\" Saba feels that she is responsible for Saman's death as she cursed her on her wedding. Saba is completely broken but develops a very strong bond with Maaz.\n\nSoon the Grandmother feels that it would be good if Saba gets married to Irtiza, as this will benefit Irtiza and Maaz, as they are lonely, and it will also benefit Saba since she has always been in love with him. Saba gets very angry hearing this proposal, as she is extremely guilt ridden, and says that she will never marry Irtiza! When Irtiza is asked about the same proposal, he outright rejects it stating that Saba deserves a much better man, and not a man who was married and has a kid, and that he cannot even think like this. Irtiza soon realises that Saba is angry with him due to the proposal, Irtiza talks with Saba and reasons with her! He tells her that he cannot even think of marrying her in his dreams and that he wants the best man for her, and he is not the best, he also says that he loves her a lot, and to not be angry with him! Saba does not seem to care much for what Irtiza says, and says \"she is not angry with him\" and leaves.\n\nSoon after Saba gets a proposal for marriage. Saba does not care to meet the man in question, and says \"yes.\" Soon Saba is married off to him. On the wedding night the man in question confesses to Saba that he is already married and has a wife and a child in America, and that he married her due to family pressure, and no matter what he can never give her the love and the importance of a wife. Strangely Saba accepts this, and tells him that she is absolutely fine with this arrangement and that she will not be telling her parents about it, which gets the man quite confused. Soon the man leaves for America, leaving Saba behind.\n\nSaba stays back in Pakistan, and Irtiza starts getting concerned about why Saba is not going to America, and why is her visa taking so much time. He confronts Saba about it on a number of occasions but Saba rudely reverts stating that such things take time, and to not interfere in her personal matters. Irtiza's concern for Saba starts growing and he decides to take matters in his own hands, one day he goes to America for a business trip and goes to meet the husband there, where he sees him with his wife and children! Irtiza gets angry seeing this and starts insulting the husband, after which the husband tells Irtiza that Saba always knew about this, and that no one had stopped her from telling you guys! Irtiza gets angry hearing this!\n\nIrtiza goes back to Pakistan and tells the family about Saba's husband 's second wife and children! He confronts Saba and gets angry with her for keeping them in the dark about this! Soon out of family pressure Saba divorces her husband and goes back home! After the divorce Saba gets even more depressed! Everyone tries to get her out of the depression but in vain! Saba gets extremely bitter with Irtiza, and tells him that she is no longer friends with him and to leave her alone! Irtiza is upset hearing this and tells her that he has always wanted the best for her, so how can she think about him like this?\n\nSaba's parents start getting really concerned about Saba's future and get very depressed. Soon Saba gets another proposal from a divorcee who is 20 years older than her and has 2 kids! Hearing this Irtiza gets very angry and tells Saba's father off for even paying heed to such a proposal! Saba's father explains to Irtiza that Saba will not be getting very good proposals anymore as she herself is a divorcee! Irtiza gets upset hearing this! One day Irtiza sees Saba's mother crying and stating what bad did my daughter did, and why is her life so difficult, Irtza hearing this tells Saba's mother that he wants to marry Saba! He also states that he cannot see Saba ruining her life anymore!\n\nSaba is absolutely furious on learning that Irtiza has proposed marriage and gets extremely angry, she goes up to Irtiza and tells him off! Irtiza listens to her anger but does not change his decision! Soon Saba's grandmother gets sick due to seeing Saba in such a state, she tells Saba to get married to Irtiza, Saba agrees to the marriage half-heartedly!\n\nSaba and Irtiza get married in an intimate ceremony. Saba does get married to Irtiza but continues to stay her old self and continues to live in the room upstairs. Saba's parents are upset watching their daughter's condition. One day Irtiza loses his patience and forces Saba to come downstairs to his room. Saba gets furious and tells him off, and tells him that he has no right to humiliate her like this! Irtiza replies that he cannot see the family suffer like this, so please at least for their sake at least pretend to be happy with this marriage! He further tells Saba that she knows him for years, and that she should trust him enough to know that he will never force himself on her, Saba agrees to his request and tells him that she can pretend to be happy with this marriage for the family's sake.\n\nSoon Saba starts softening up, and starts participating in family activities. The parents are happy to see this change in Saba. Irtiza then one day announces that he needs to go to America for a month or two for business. The family tell Irtiza that Saba should also go along with him! Saba tries to protest but in vain!\n\nBoth Saba and Irtiza go to America. Upon landing in America and in the house where Saman and Irtiza used to live, Saba starts to feel very disturbed! To the extent of nearly fainting, Irtiza observes this and helps her! Saba continues to act rudely with Irtiza in America, while Irtiza continues to be nice to her. Slowly Saba soften ups and starts going out with irtiza for outings. Irtiza starts to develop feelings for Saba, and tries his best to bring out the same chirpy Saba that she used to be!\n\nOne evening Irtiza finds Saba sleeping on the couch, he puts a blanket on her and observes her sleeping, soon Saba wakes up, and politely smiles at him, Irtiza looks deep into her eyes and holds her hands, which makes Saba very uncomfortable! Saba walks up to leave, but Irtiza stops her by holding her arm, Saba gets furious and starts shouting at Irtiza! And tells him point blank that she does not want to see his face, and why is that so hard for him to understand? Irtiza gets very hurt and angry hearing this and tells her that after they go back to Pakistan he will make the kind of arrangements that Saba will hardly have to see him at all! He gets angry and leaves, leaving Saba upset and anxious about hurting Irtiza!\n\nAfter the incident Saba tries hard to communicate with Irtiza, but in vain! One day Saba gets through to Irtiza and tells him to come early from work as she feels extremely lonely here all alone, Irtiza softens up and tells her that he will be back by 5pm. Irtiza leaves for office, after which a friend comes to meet him and tells him to visit a construction site with him. Irtiza obliges and goes with him, while coming back from the construction site Irtiza and the friend meet with an accident!\n\nSaba continues to wait for Irtiza at home, soon she gets a phone call informing her about the car accident, Saba gets extremely disturbed by the news and starts anxiously shivering, in the morning Saba hears a car pulling up in the driveway and she runs and finds Irtiza there! As soon as Saba sees Irtiza she starts pushing him, and starts hitting him, she yells at him and says \"Where have you been! You told me you will be home by the evening!\" Irtiza tries to explain that he met with an accident, Saba gets more hyper after hearing this and says \"All of you guys are planning to leave me, first Saman left and now even you are planning to leave me, all of you guys want to leave me here all alone!\" She gets hyper and starts shoving him, Irtiza loses his cool and holds her and shouts \"I am going nowhere! I am here with you!\"\n\nSaba and irtiza enter back home! Saba starts confessing everything! She starts by telling him that she has loved him for all these years! And if anything ever happens to him she will die! She then further starts confessing that it is because of this love she feels so guilty, because it is because of this love she cursed her sister and she is no longer in this world! She cries her heart out and blames Irtiza for always taking so much care of her! And always being there for her! And because of this she fell in love with him so deeply! She cries and questions him! \"Why did you care for me so much?\" After the confession Saba passes out and Irtiza puts her on the couch to sleep.\n\nWhile Saba is sleeping, Irtiza watches her, and remember all that Saba has confessed and has tears in his eyes! Soon after when Saba wakes up, Irtiza tells Saba that he has always cared for her, because he has always loved her! Seeing her happy has always been his priority in his life! He says that the love he has felt for her all these years is very pure, it is the kind of love that is not selfish but selfless, this love only wants to see her happy, the love he has for her cannot be shaken up no matter how rude she is with him, no matter what she does, he can never hate her, he says \"You expect me to hate you, but someone who has loved you all their life can never hate you! \" To which Saba replies that he lost his wife because of her! Irtiza tells her that no one can control destiny and life, and that she is not responsible for Saman's death! It is a bad incident that happened! And that she is not liable for it! He also says that he does not believe both of them have done any disservice to Saman! He further says that she needs to stop being ashamed of loving him, because no matter how much the try their love for each other can never die! Both Saba and Irtiza hug each other. Later they are shown to live happily ever after!\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Main Cast===\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Irtaza Muzaffar\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Saba Shafiq \n* [[Armeena Rana Khan]] as Saman Shafiq\n\n===Recurring Cast===\n* [[Adnan Malik]] as Aamir\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Shafiq (Saba and Saman's father)\n* [[Zeba Bakhtiar]] as Maliha Shafiq (Saba and Saman's mother) \n* [[Jahanzeb Khan]] as Zafar \n* [[Junaid Khan (singer)|Junaid Khan]] as Safir \n* Azra Mansoor as Saba and Saman's dadi\n* Aini Zaidi as Talat \n* Rashid Khawaja as Ansar (Maleeha's brother)\n* Aini Zaidi as Ansar's wife, Maleeha's sister-in-law\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Safeer's mother (young)\n* Arjumand Azhar as Javed\n* Shazia Naz as Sonia\n* Saima Kanwal as Safeer's mother (old)\n* Sonia Nayyar\n\n===Guest Cast===\n* [[Zaheen Tahira]] as Rehmat Bi\n* [[Faiza Hassan]] as Singer (episode 1)\n* [[Adeel Hussain]] as co-dancer in Ballay Ballay song\n* [[Saman Ansari]] as Hira Amir's sister (Cameo appearance)\n* [[Sidra Batool]] as Shiza (Saba's friend)\n\n== Production ==\n===Development=== \nIn 2013, it was announced that a drama series is being developed based on [[Farhat Ishtiaq]]'s novel ''[[Bin Roye Ansoo]]'', before the project went into [[development hell]] for almost half an year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bin Roye Starring Mahira Khan \u2013 Release Date & Official Poster |url=http://www.brandsynario.com/bin-roye-starring-mahira-khan-release-date-official-poster/|first=Yusra|last=Hussain|publisher=HIP|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> It was later revealed that ''Bin Roye'' will be released as a theatrical film and later on as TV series.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HUM Films presents BIN ROYE \u2013 the movie|url=http://blogs.humnetwork.com/hum-films-presents-bin-roye-the-movie/|last=Zarish| first=Gill|publisher=[[Hum TV]]|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Actor [[Humayun Saeed]] who played the lead role in film revealed, \"''Bin Roye'' is a romantic drama.

It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

The song was modified and adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944.

It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.
