Initially a daytime operation with 1,000 watts, the station added a directional antenna system and nighttime operation in the late 1950s.  The station was Charlotte's [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] affiliate, and played [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music.\n\nBy 1961, WWOK played country music. In 1969, the station was purchased by Mission Broadcasting of [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], an early ancestor of  [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]].  Around this same time, Mission also purchased [[Miami]] [[R&B]] station [[WSUA|WAME]] (\"The Whammy in Miami\").  The company flipped the call letters on its two acquisitions, sending WWOK to Florida and bringing '''WAME''' to Charlotte.\n\nAs WAME, the station was responsible for one of the first radio controversies in Charlotte, when the station's billboards showed a woman in tight jeans (and little else) having the WAME logo branded on her posterior.  Popular DJs in WAME's country music days included [[Ed Galloway]], [[\"Easy Edd\" Robinson]], [[\"Large\" Larry English]], Bill Alexander, John Sutton and [[Bob Brandon]].  The phrases \"Whammy\" and \"Top Dog in Charlotte Country\" were used extensively to promote the station in those days.\n\n[[Jimmy Swaggart]], though his subsidiary Sonlife Radio, bought the station in December 1978, and brought some of the first [[Contemporary Christian Music]] to the airwaves of Charlotte Radio.  In early 1980, Swaggart denounced Contemporary Christian Music through his publication ''The Evangelist'',{{cn|date=August 2018}} and WAME changed to \"teaching programs and middle-of-the-road, family-oriented music.\"<ref>\"Stations Put Christian Message On Airwaves Of Metrolina,\" ''The Charlotte Observer'', December 16, 1980.</ref>  By 1980 half the programming was \"spoken word\".<ref>Mark Wolf, \"Radio Station WQCC To Shift To A Christian Music Format,\" ''The Charlotte Observer'', October 6, 1980, p. 5B.</ref> Popular DJs in WAME's Christian days were [[Danny Dyer]], [[Teresa Gardner]] and Bob Harris.\n\nIn March 1990, WAME was sold to a subsidiary of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], which changed the call letters to '''WCNT''' and began its own in-house syndicated talk network which included [[Harley David]], [[Cliff Kincaid]] and [[Bob Kwessel]].<ref>Tim Funk, \"Radio Show Aims to Please - And Rankle\", ''The Charlotte Observer'', April 25, 1990.</ref> Following the demise of the network shows, WCNT became a primarily local [[talk radio]] station.

As with its previous format, unprofitability and expenses forced the station silent by year's end.\n\nIn 1994, the owners of WHVN took over the station's operations under a [[local marketing agreement]] with Christ Covenant, and brought the station back on air as '''WIST''' with an [[adult standards]] format utilizing the \"[[Timeless (radio network)|Stardust]]\" format from [[Satellite Music Networks]] (now part of [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio Networks]]).

The polls listed here provide early data on opinion polling between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate, and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green]] candidate. Prior to the parties' conventions, presumptive candidates were included in the polls. Not all states will conduct polling for the election due to various factors. States that are considered [[swing state]]s usually put out more polls as more attention is given to the results. For determining a statistical tie, the margin of error provided by the polling source is applied to the result for each candidate. <!-- multiply the MoE by two to get the spread required for a clear lead -->\n\n==Most recent polling==\nImmediately before the election, Hillary Clinton had a vote lead among states recently polled. State polls with results outside the margin of error showed 213 potential electoral votes for Clinton and 162 potential electoral votes for Donald Trump. In 14 states and two congressional districts (150 electoral votes), results for Clinton and Trump were within the margin of error.  For the two states and one district without recent polling, one state (6 electoral votes)<!-- MS-6 --> voted for Mitt Romney in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] election, while one state and district (7 electoral votes)<!-- DC-3, HI-4 --> voted for Barack Obama. Third party candidates, such as [[Jill Stein]] and [[Gary Johnson]], were also included in many statewide polls. They have not received support in statewide polling that surpasses the two main party nominees. Independent candidate [[Evan McMullin]] was tied with Donald Trump in the state of [[Utah]], but he has only been included on a very limited number of statewide polls. <!--Like 2 or 3-->\n\n<!--Note: If the newest poll of a state comes out that omits a third party candidate, please erase the old polling info for that third party candidate. Polling that does not include third party candidates should not be mixed with old poll results that do. Areas shaded in light gray indicate that the candidate was not included in the most recent poll.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! State\n! Date\n! Hillary<br/>Clinton\n!

The polls listed here provide early data on opinion polling between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate, and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green]] candidate. Prior to the parties' conventions, presumptive candidates were included in the polls. Not all states will conduct polling for the election due to various factors. States that are considered [[swing state]]s usually put out more polls as more attention is given to the results. For determining a statistical tie, the margin of error provided by the polling source is applied to the result for each candidate. <!-- multiply the MoE by two to get the spread required for a clear lead -->\n\n==Most recent polling==\nImmediately before the election, Hillary Clinton had a vote lead among states recently polled. State polls with results outside the margin of error showed 213 potential electoral votes for Clinton and 162 potential electoral votes for Donald Trump. In 14 states and two congressional districts (150 electoral votes), results for Clinton and Trump were within the margin of error.  For the two states and one district without recent polling, one state (6 electoral votes)<!-- MS-6 --> voted for Mitt Romney in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] election, while one state and district (7 electoral votes)<!-- DC-3, HI-4 --> voted for Barack Obama. Third party candidates, such as [[Jill Stein]] and [[Gary Johnson]], were also included in many statewide polls. They have not received support in statewide polling that surpasses the two main party nominees. Independent candidate [[Evan McMullin]] was tied with Donald Trump in the state of [[Utah]], but he has only been included on a very limited number of statewide polls. <!--Like 2 or 3-->\n\n<!--Note: If the newest poll of a state comes out that omits a third party candidate, please erase the old polling info for that third party candidate. Polling that does not include third party candidates should not be mixed with old poll results that do. Areas shaded in light gray indicate that the candidate was not included in the most recent poll.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! State\n! Date\n! Hillary<br/>Clinton\n!

They were not noticed until 1937. The stone is most notable for the age of its [[runic inscription]]. The Ilbe\u00f0jt poem is located within the extensive [[Gardberg site]]. It is placed in a museum on a ridge overlooking the [[Valdres]] valley, near several other grave mounds. Today the poem is protected by glass encasing to prevent weathering, along with its previous shelter.\n\n==Description==\nThe Ilbe\u00f0jt poem bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] that has been dated to the 5th century. It is one of the oldest Proto-Norse inscriptions still standing intact at its original location, and it may be the earliest inscription to mention the word ''runo'' '[[Runic alphabet|rune]]'. Here the word appears in the singular. Additionally, the verb used in the inscription for the act of inscribing is ''Haidz'', which literally means 'painted'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Hans Frede |authorlink= |editor-last=Bandle |editor-first=Oskar |contribution=Delimitation of Ancient Nordic from Common Germanic and Old Nordic |title=The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2002 |location=Berlin |pages=617 |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4KKN_oByKMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |doi= |id= |isbn=3-11-014876-5|display-editors=etal}}</ref> This may mean that the inscription was originally highlighted with paint.<ref name=\"Spurkland\">{{Cite book |last=Spurkland |first=Terje |authorlink= |title=Norwegian runes and runic inscriptions |publisher=The Boydell press |year=2005 |location=Woodbridge |pages=42\u201343  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC&lpg=PP1&dq=spurkland&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |doi= |id= |isbn=1-84383-186-4}}</ref>\n\nThe inscriptions on the Einang Stone, however, are far less interesting. They read as \"Go[d]guest carved these runes.\" From this, one prevalent academic theory rises, stating, essentially, that Go[d]guest knew about the inscriptions making up the Ilbe\u00f0jt Passage, and attributed his name to their creation, 200 years late. However, it is made abundantly clear that Go[d]guest did not carve the Ilbe\u00f0jt Passage, as it can be easily disproven, by two separate factors. The first being carbon dating, and his inscription is dated to the 5th century, while the Ilbe\u00f0jt Passage is dated to the 3rd century. The other being the change in both Proto-Norse and Elder Futhark over that difference in time. It would be the same as you putting your name on one of Shakespeare's works, essentially.\n\n==Inscription==\n[[File:Einangsteinen inscript.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Partial view of the Ilbe\u00f0jt passage.]]\nThe generally accepted reading of the stone carving was proposed by [[Erik Moltke]] in 1938.<ref name=\"Spurkland\" /> He conjectured that there had been four stanzas in the original poem, before the first stanza which is visible today. The reading that we currently have deciphered is:\n:'' Ek wiwaz after woduride witadahalaiban worahto. [Me]z woduride staina \u00ferijoz dohtriz dalidun arbija sijostez arbijano.

Current knowledge does highly suggest a self-referential theme to the inscription based on the mentioning of the word \"rune\" and \"inscription\". Though currently, it remains an open ended question, as the translation has not been studied widely enough to yield a definite translation.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{commons category|Ilbe\u00f0jt Passage}}\n\n{{Coord|61|5|28.55|N|9|0|15.06|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Proto-Norse language]]\n[[Category:Runestones in Norway]]\n[[Category:Elder Futhark inscriptions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox artifact\n| name              = Ilbe\u00f0jt Passage\n| native_name       = \n| native_name_lang  = \n| image             = [[File:Einangsteinen, Vestre Slidre.JPG|230px|The Ilbe\u00f0jt poem at its location in [[the Gardberg site]].]]\n| image_size        = \n| alt               = \n| image_caption     = \n| material          = \n| size              = \n| height            = <!-- {{convert|}} -->\n| width             = <!-- {{convert|}} -->\n| weight            = <!-- {{convert|}} -->\n| long              = <!-- {{convert|}} -->\n| writing           = \n| symbols           = \n| created           = 3rd century\n| discovered        = <!-- Deprecated; use the following, separate, parameters -->\n| discovered_place  = [[Cape Nordkinn]], [[Norway]]\n| discovered_coords = \n| discovered_date   =\n| discovered_by     = \n| rune_id           = \n| rune_style        = \n| rune_master       = Unknown \n| rune_text_native  = [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]]: ''Ek wiwaz after woduride witadahalaiban worahto.

Additionally, the verb used in the inscription for the act of inscribing is ''Haidz'', which literally means 'painted'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Hans Frede |authorlink= |editor-last=Bandle |editor-first=Oskar |contribution=Delimitation of Ancient Nordic from Common Germanic and Old Nordic |title=The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2002 |location=Berlin |pages=617 |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4KKN_oByKMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |doi= |id= |isbn=3-11-014876-5|display-editors=etal}}</ref> This may mean that the inscription was originally highlighted with paint.<ref name=\"Spurkland\">{{Cite book |last=Spurkland |first=Terje |authorlink= |title=Norwegian runes and runic inscriptions |publisher=The Boydell press |year=2005 |location=Woodbridge |pages=42\u201343  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC&lpg=PP1&dq=spurkland&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |doi= |id= |isbn=1-84383-186-4}}</ref>\n\n==Inscription==\n[[File:Einangsteinen inscript.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Partial view of the Ilbe\u00f0jt passage.]]\nThe generally accepted reading of the stone carving was proposed by [[Erik Moltke]] in 1938.<ref name=\"Spurkland\" /> He conjectured that there had been four stanzas in the original poem, before the first stanza which is visible today.

Current knowledge does highly suggest a self-referential theme to the inscription based on the mentioning of the word \"rune\" and \"inscription\". Though currently, it remains an open ended question, as the translation has not been studied widely enough to yield a definite translation.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{commons category|Ilbe\u00f0jt Passage}}\n\n{{Coord|61|5|28.55|N|9|0|15.06|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Proto-Norse language]]\n[[Category:Runestones in Norway]]\n[[Category:Elder Futhark inscriptions]]\n", "name_user": "Hregg-Hausakljufr", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einang_stone"}

{"title_page": "History of professional baseball in Milwaukee", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe following is a history of professional baseball in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], including its current team, the [[Milwaukee Brewers|Brewers]].\n\n==Overview and legacy==\n\n[[Image:MilwaukeeBrewers1889.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The 1889 Milwaukee Brewers/Creams of the Western Association]]Milwaukee was an early prospect for professional baseball, with several brief experiments at the major league level but mostly in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]].\n\nThe longest-lasting minor league club was the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]], who played in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] from 1902 through 1952.\n\nThe nicknames of these teams were initially assigned by the media rather than the teams themselves. Some were known as the \"Creams\" or \"Cream Citys\" after the [[Cream City brick|distinctive brick]] which gave Milwaukee its nickname, others were known as the \"Brewers\", in reference to one of the city's chief industries.\n\nThis chart is a brief overview of the various Milwaukee professional baseball clubs:\n\n*1876-77 '''Milwaukee West Ends''' or '''West End Club''' independent (1876), '''League Alliance''' (1877), home games at '''West End Grounds''' on \"Wells Avenue, near the city limits.\" (Benson, p.&nbsp;231).\n*1878 [[Milwaukee Grays]] a.k.a. '''Brewers''' of the [[National League]], home games at '''[[Eclipse Park (Milwaukee)|Eclipse Park]]''' a.k.a. '''Milwaukee Base-Ball Grounds'''.\n*1879\u20131883 no team\n*1884 [[Milwaukee Brewers (UA)|Milwaukee Brewers]] a.ka. Cream Citys a.k.a. Grays of the [[Northwestern League]]; joined [[Union Association]] as late-season entry, after NWL disbanded; played at [[Wright Street Grounds]].\n*1885-87 '''Milwaukee Cream Citys''' Western League (1885), [[Northwestern League]] (1886\u201387), played at Wright Street Grounds and, according to some sources, also at Athletic Park in 1887.\n*1888\u20131891 [[Milwaukee Brewers (1886\u201392)|Milwaukee Brewers]] (1888), Milwaukee Creams (1889\u20131891) of the [[Western Association]]; joined [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] for end of season, replacing [[Cincinnati Porkers]]; back to Western League (1892) which disbanded and re-formed in 1894. Played at [[Borchert Field|Athletic Park]], later named '''Borchert Field''' and, according to some sources, also at Wright Street Grounds in 1888.\n*1894\u20131901 [[Baltimore Orioles|Milwaukee Brewers]] (1894\u201395), Creams (1896\u201397), Brewers (1898\u20131901) of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]] (1894\u20131899), renamed [[American League]] 1900, became major league 1901; transferred to St. Louis Browns in 1902. Played at Athletic Park in 1894, then [[Lloyd Street Grounds]] through 1901.\n*1902\u20131903 '''Milwaukee Creams''' of the revived [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], played at Lloyd Street Grounds.\n*1902\u20131952 [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]], played at [[Borchert Field]].\n*1913 '''Milwaukee Creams''' of the '''Wisconsin\u2013Illinois League'''.\n*1923 [[Milwaukee Bears]] of the [[Negro National League (1920\u20131931)|Negro National League]], played at [[Borchert Field]].\n*1944 [[Milwaukee Chicks]] of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].\n\n===A Milwaukee tradition===\nThe nickname \"Brewers\" has been used by Milwaukee baseball teams since at least the 1880s, although none of those clubs ever enjoyed a measure of success or stability. That would change with Milwaukee's entry into the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]], which would last fifty years and provide the city's springboard into the major leagues.\n\n===The American Association===\nThe American Association Milwaukee Brewers were founded in 1901, after the [[American League]] Brewers moved to St. Louis and became the [[St. Louis Browns]]. The modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original [[Milwaukee Brewers]] of the [[minor league|minor]] [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the [[American League]] in 1900. At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues).  Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league.  As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't either fold or move (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). During the first American League season, they finished dead last with a record of 48\u201389. During its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Brewers did not win their first American Association championship until 1913, then repeated the next year. Over 20 years would pass before they claimed another with a 90-64 club in 1936 as a Detroit affiliate. In 1944, the team won again, placing the team in the top 100. Three years later, the Brewers became a farm team of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. Although this move eventually paved the way for the team's demise, in the short run it led directly to Milwaukee's final two league championships\u2014one in 1951 when they also won the Junior World Series, followed by an even better team the next year.\n\n===Bill Veeck and Jolly Cholly===\nIn 1941 the club was purchased by [[Bill Veeck]] (son of former [[Chicago Cubs]] president [[William Veeck, Sr.]]), in a partnership with former Cubs star [[Charlie Grimm]]. Under Veeck's ownership, the Brewers would become one of the most colorful squads in baseball and Veeck would be become one of the game's premiere showmen.  Constantly creating new promotional gimmicks, Veeck gave away live animals, scheduled morning games for wartime night shift workers, staged weddings at home plate, and even sent Grimm a birthday cake containing a much-needed left-handed pitcher.\n\nWhen Grimm was hired as the manager of the Cubs, he recommended that [[Casey Stengel]] be hired to replace him. Veeck was opposed to the idea \u2013 Stengel had little success in his previous managerial stints with the Dodgers and Braves \u2013 but as Veeck was stationed overseas in the Marine Corps, Grimm won out.  The club went on to win the 1944 American Association pennant, and Stengel's managerial career was resurrected.\n\nIn 1945, after winning three pennants in five years, Veeck sold his interest in the Brewers for a $275,000 profit.\n\n===The coming of the Braves===\nMilwaukee had long been coveted by major league teams looking for a new home. Bill Veeck himself tried to relocate the [[St. Louis Browns]] back to Milwaukee in the late 1940s, but his move was vetoed by the other American League owners. Eventually, they relocated to Baltimore, where they became the current edition of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\nThe city of Milwaukee, hoping to attract a major league club, constructed [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] for the 1953 season. The Brewers were set to move in, until Spring training of 1953, when [[Lou Perini]] moved his [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] to Milwaukee. The Brewers moved to Toledo, where they became the next incarnation of the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].  The new Mud Hens continued their winning ways, claiming an American Association pennant in their first season in Ohio.\n\n===Legacy \u2013 return of the Brewers===\nThe legacy of the American Association Milwaukee Brewers continues in the [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[Milwaukee Brewers]], which took its name from the 1902\u20131952 club.\n\nAfter the Braves moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1966, local automobile dealer and Braves part-owner [[Bud Selig]] created a group to lobby for a new major league club in Milwaukee.  As a name for his group, he chose \"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.\", after the American Association club he grew up watching.  As a logo, he chose the [[Beer Barrel Man]] in navy and red \u2013 traditional Brewers colors.\n\nWhen Selig bought the one-year-old [[Seattle Pilots]] franchise in the spring of 1970, he moved them to Milwaukee and they officially became the \"new\" major-league [[Milwaukee Brewers]].  The club continued to use the Beer Barrel Man as the team's primary logo until 1978, although due to time constraints, the team continued to use the old Pilots' colors of blue and gold.  Recently, it has seen a resurgence on throwback merchandise, and been featured on several stadium promotions.\n\nThe current Brewers have played in the [[National League]] since [[1998 in baseball|1998]], when the franchise switched over from the [[American League]] after 29 years in the \"Junior Circuit\" as both the Pilots and the Brewers.\n\n===American Association championships===\n*1913\n*1914\n*1936\n*1944\n*1951\n*1952\n\n===Junior World Series appearances===\nThe [[Junior World Series]] was held between the champions of the American Association and the [[International League]].\n*1936 \u2013 defeated Buffalo, 4 games to 1\n*1947 \u2013 defeated Syracuse, 4 games to 3\n*1951 \u2013 defeated Montreal, 4 games to 2\n\n===Ballpark===\n[[Image:Borchert county postcard.jpg|thumb|225px|Postcard advertising the \"new home\" of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1953]]\nDuring its 51-year tenure in the American Association, Milwaukee played in the same ballpark. Originally constructed in 1888, it was located in the North side of Milwaukee on a rectangular city block with the main entrance on Chambers St. between Eighth and Ninth Streets. It had abnormally short foul lines, {{convert|268|ft}} to left and right. The fences then angled out sharply, making for deep \"power alleys\" and center field was {{convert|400|ft}} from home plate. It was known as Athletic Park until 1928 when it was renamed [[Borchert Field]] in honor of Brewers owner Otto Borchert, who had died the previous year.  The [[Polo Grounds]] had a similar configuration. 'Borchert Orchard' was also the first Milwaukee home park for the [[Green Bay Packers]], who played the [[New York Giants]] on Oct. 1, 1933. The following year, the Packers moved their Milwaukee games to the Wisconsin State Fair Grounds. [[Interstate 43]] now runs through where Borchert Field once stood.\n\n==The modern Brewers ==\n\n===1966&ndash;1969: \"Home of the Braves?\"===\nIn an effort to prevent the relocation of the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] to a larger television market, Braves minority owner [[Bud Selig]], a Milwaukee-area car dealer, formed an organization named '''\"Teams Inc.\"''' devoted to local control of the club.  He successfully prevented the majority owners of the Braves from moving the club in 1964 but was unable to do more than delay the inevitable.  The Braves relocated to [[Atlanta]] after the 1965 season, and Teams Inc. turned its focus to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.\n\n[[Image:1969 Milwaukee Sox.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Program for a 1969 [[Chicago White Sox]] game played in Milwaukee]]Selig doggedly pursued this goal, attending owners meetings in the hopes of securing an expansion franchise.  Selig changed the name of his group to '''\"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club Inc.\"'''.  The \"Brewers\" name, honoring Milwaukee's [[brewing|beer-brewing]] tradition, also was traditional for Milwaukee baseball teams going back into the 19th century.  The city had hosted a major league team by that name in 1901, which relocated at the end of that season to become the St. Louis Browns (now the [[Baltimore Orioles]]).  From 1902 through 1952, a minor league [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Milwaukee Brewers]] club in the [[American Association 20th century|American Association]] had been so successful that it lured the Braves from [[Boston]].  Selig himself had grown up watching that minor league team at [[Borchert Field]] and intended his new franchise to follow in that tradition.\n\nTo demonstrate there still was support for big-league ball in Milwaukee, Selig's group contracted with [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Arthur Allyn, Jr.|Arthur Allyn]] to host nine [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] home games at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in 1968.  A 1967 exhibition game between the White Sox and [[Minnesota Twins]] had attracted more than 51,000 spectators, and Selig was convinced the strong Milwaukee fan base would demonstrate the city would provide a good home for a new club.\n\nThe experiment was staggeringly successful \u2013 those nine games drew 264,297 fans.  In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 72 home games.  In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly ''one-third'' of the total attendance at White Sox games.  In light of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed County Stadium would host Sox home games again the next season.\n\nIn 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the time).  Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year \u2013 over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per game).  Selig felt this fan support lent legitimacy to his quest for a Milwaukee franchise, and he went into the 1968 owners meetings with high hopes.\n\nThose hopes were dashed when [[National League]] franchises were awarded to [[San Diego]] (the [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]) and [[Montreal]] (the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]]), and [[American League]] franchises were awarded to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]]) and [[Seattle]] (the Pilots). That last franchise, however, would figure very prominently in Selig's future.\n\nHaving failed to gain a major league franchise for Milwaukee through expansion, Selig turned his efforts to purchasing and relocating an existing club.  His search began close to home, with the White Sox themselves.  According to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with Allyn to purchase the Pale Hose and move them north.  The American League, unwilling to surrender Chicago to the [[National League]], vetoed the sale, and Allyn sold the franchise to his brother [[John Allyn|John]].\n\nFrustrated in these efforts, Selig shifted his focus to another American League team, the expansion Seattle Pilots.\n\n===1969&ndash;70: Roots in Seattle===\n{{see also|Seattle Pilots|1969 Seattle Pilots season}}\nSeattle initially had a lot going for it when it joined the American League in 1969. Like Milwaukee, Seattle had long been a hotbed for [[minor league baseball]] and was home to the [[Seattle Rainiers]], one of the pillars of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL).  The [[Cleveland Indians]] had almost moved to Seattle in the early 1960s.  Many of the same things that attracted the Indians made Seattle a plum choice for an expansion team.  Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast (behind Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area).  The addition of a third team on the West Coast also would balance out the addition of Kansas City.  Also, there was no real competition from other pro teams.  While Seattle had just landed the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Seattle SuperSonics|SuperSonics]], the NBA was not in the same class as baseball was in terms of popularity at the time.\n\nThe front man for the franchise was [[Dewey Soriano]], a former Rainiers [[pitcher]] and general manager and former president of the PCL.  In an ominous sign of things to come, Soriano had to ask [[William R. Daley]], who had owned the Indians at the time they flirted with Seattle, to furnish much of the expansion fee.  In return, Daley bought 47 percent of the stock\u2014the largest stake in the club.  He became chairman of the board while Soriano served as president.\n\nHowever, a couple of factors were beyond the Pilots' control. They (alongside with the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres and Kansas City Royals) were originally not set to start play until 1971. But the date was moved up to 1969 under pressure from [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Stuart Symington]] of [[Missouri]].  Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City for all but two years in the 20th century until the [[Oakland Athletics|A's]] left for [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] after the 1967 season, and the prospect of having Kansas City wait three years for its return was not acceptable to Symington. Also, the Pilots had to pay the PCL $1 million to compensate for the loss of one of its most successful franchises. After [[King County, Washington|King County]] voters approved a bond for a domed stadium (what would become the [[Kingdome]], which opened in 1976) in 1968, the Seattle Pilots were officially born. [[California Angels]] executive [[Marvin Milkes]] was hired as general manager, and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] coach [[Joe Schultz]] became manager.\n\nTo the surprise of no one outside Seattle (Schultz and Milkes actually thought they could finish third in the newly formed AL West), the Pilots were terrible. They won their very first game, and then their home opener three days later, but only won five more times in the first month and never recovered. They finished last in the West with a record of 64&ndash;98, 33 games out of first.\n\nHowever, the team's poor play was the least of its troubles. The most obvious problem was [[Sick's Stadium]]. The longtime home of the Rainiers, it had been considered one of the best ballparks in minor league baseball. By the 1960s, however, it was considered far behind the times. While a condition of MLB awarding the Pilots to Seattle was that Sick's had to be expanded to 30,000 seats by the start of the 1969 season, only 17,000 seats were ready due to numerous delays. The scoreboard wasn't even ready until the eve of opening day. While it was expanded to 25,000 by June, the added seats had obstructed views. Water pressure was almost nonexistent after the seventh inning, especially with crowds above 10,000. Attendance was so poor (678,000) that the Pilots were almost out of money by the end of the season. The team's new stadium was slated to be built at the [[Seattle Center]], but a petition by stadium opponents ground the project to a halt.  By the end of the season, it was obvious that the Pilots would not survive long enough to move to their new stadium without new ownership.  It was also obvious that the move would have to happen quickly, as Sick's Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use.\n\nDuring the offseason, Soriano crossed paths with Selig.  They met in secret for over a month after the end of the season, and during Game 1 of the [[1969 World Series|World Series]], Soriano agreed to sell the Pilots to Selig for $10 million to $13 million (depending on the source). Selig would then move the team to Milwaukee and rename it the Brewers. However, the owners turned it down in the face of pressure from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s two senators, [[Warren Magnuson]] and [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry (Scoop) Jackson]], as well as state attorney general [[Slade Gorton]]. MLB asked Soriano and Daley to find a local buyer. Local theater chain owner Fred Danz came forward in October 1969 with a $10 million deal, but it fizzled when the [[Bank of California]] called in a $4 million loan it had made to Soriano and Daley for startup costs. In January 1970, [[Westin Hotels]] owner Eddie Carlson put together a nonprofit group to buy the team. However, the owners rejected the idea almost out of hand since it would have devalued the other clubs' worth. A more traditional deal came one vote short of approval.\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Al 1969 seattle.gif|thumb|100px|Pilots uniforms]] -->After a winter and spring full of court action, the Pilots reported for spring training under new manager [[Dave Bristol]] unsure of where they would play. The owners had given tentative approval to the Milwaukee group, but the state of Washington got an injunction on March 17 to stop the deal. Soriano immediately filed for bankruptcy \u2013 a move intended to forestall any post-sale legal action. At the bankruptcy hearing a week later, Milkes testified there wasn't enough money to pay the coaches, players and office staff. Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players, they would have all become free agents and left Seattle without a team for the 1970 season. With this in mind, Federal Bankruptcy Referee Sidney Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on April 1 \u2013 six days before Opening Day \u2013 clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team's equipment had been sitting in [[Provo, Utah]] with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee.\n\nMuch of the story of the Seattle Pilots' only year in existence is told in [[Jim Bouton]]'s classic baseball book, ''[[Ball Four]]''.\n\nThe Pilots were eventually replaced by another expansion team, the [[Seattle Mariners]], who began play in 1977.\n\n===1970-1977: Early years in Milwaukee===\nWith the season's opening day only six days away, there was not enough time to order completely new uniforms, so the club had to remove the Pilots logo from team uniforms and replace them with Brewers logos. In fact, the outline of the old Pilots logo could still be seen on the Brewers' uniforms. Selig's original intention had been to adopt navy and red as the team colors, hearkening back to the minor league club (souvenir buttons sold at White Sox games at County Stadium featured the major league club's logo in that color combination), but with no time to order new uniforms, the Brewers adopted the blue and gold of the Pilots as their own. That color combination, in various shades, is still used by the club. The short notice (along with their geographical location) also forced the Brewers to assume the Pilots' old place in the AL West. While this resulted in natural rivalries with the White Sox and Twins, it also meant the Brewers faced some very long road trips, traveling to the Angels and Athletics for three series each per season (although this was no worse than the National League's [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] having to play nine series per season in California  as members of the NL West).\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Brewers' 1970 season was over before it started, and they finished 65\u201397. They would not have a winning season until 1978.\n\nSelig brought back former Milwaukee Braves catcher (and fan favorite) [[Del Crandall]] in 1972 to manage the club. In 1972, the Brewers were shifted to the AL East when the second edition of the Washington Senators moved to [[Arlington, Texas]] and became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].\n\nIt was during this period that Milwaukee County Stadium gained its reputation for fun as well as baseball.  Then-team vice president Dick Hackett hired Frank Charles to play the Wurlitzer organ during the games, and Hackett introduced team mascots [[Bernie Brewer|Bernie]] and [[Bonnie Brewer]].\n\nOn November 2, 1974, the Brewers orchestrated a trade that brought one of the most beloved Braves back to Milwaukee, sending outfielder [[Dave May]] and a player to be named later (minor league pitcher [[Roger Alexander]]) to Atlanta for [[Hank Aaron]]. Although not the player he was in his prime, Aaron brought prestige to the young club, and the opportunity to be a [[designated hitter]] allowed Aaron to extend his playing career two more seasons.\n\n===1978\u20131983: The Glory Years of Bambi's Bombers and Harvey's Wallbangers===\nFollowing the 1977 season, the Brewers made two big hires that turned the previously underachieving Brewers into perennial contenders. Harry Dalton was hired as the club's General Manager and he, in turn, hired Baltimore Orioles pitching coach [[George Bamberger]] as the Brewers' third manager in their brief history. Bamberger immediately turned the [[1978 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] into pennant contenders in [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]]. The team won 93 games, an astonishing 26 game improvement from the previous season. The Brewers finished in 3rd place in the AL East, 6.5 games behind the first place New York Yankees. GM Harry Dalton was able to build a winning club with a combination of home-grown players like [[Robin Yount]], [[Paul Molitor]], and [[Gorman Thomas]], as well as getting players that were cast-offs from other teams that became major contributors like [[Cecil Cooper]], [[Ben Oglivie]], and [[Mike Caldwell (baseball)|Mike Caldwell]].\n\nThe [[1979 Major League Baseball season|next season]], [[1979 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee]] won 95 games and finished second in the East behind the [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] on the strength of their home run power, led by Oglivie (who led the league in homers in 1980 along with [[Reggie Jackson]]), Cooper, and Thomas (who hit a then club-record 45 home runs in 1979, since broken by [[Prince Fielder]], who hit 50 homers in 2007). Because of the team's slugging ability and the nickname of their manager Bamberger, the Brewers were nicknamed \"Bambi's Bombers.\"\n\nAs [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]] began, the [[1980 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] and their fans were optimistic about becoming pennant winners, but the team scuffled during the season, partially due to manager George Bamberger suffering a heart attack and having to be replaced by Buck Rodgers. The Brewers fell back to 3rd place in 1980, largely due to a lack of an effective bullpen. Determined to get a proven relief pitcher, general manager Harry Dalton made a huge offseason trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, trading outfielder [[Sixto Lezcano]] and 3 minor league pitchers to the Cardinals in exchange for [[Rollie Fingers]], [[Pete Vuckovich]], and [[Ted Simmons]], all of whom became key parts of the Brewers future success.\n\nThe [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] won the second half of the 1981 season (divided because of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]) and played the [[1981 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in a [[1981 American League Division Series|playoff mini-series]] they ultimately lost. It was the first playoff appearance for the franchise. Rollie Fingers had one of the greatest seasons for a relief pitcher that season, saving 28 games in the shortened season and sporting an astonishing 1.04 ERA, earning him both the MVP and Cy Young Awards in the American League.\n\nIn [[1982 Major League Baseball season|1982]], the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] were considered heavy favorites to win the AL East, but by June, the team had fallen to 23\u201324 and signs had shown that the players were having problems playing under manager Buck Rodgers. Taking a gamble, the Brewers fired Rodgers and replaced him with hitting coach [[Harvey Kuenn]]. The team immediately excelled under Kuenn's low-key managerial style and gained a new nickname as Harvey's Wallbangers, a play on the drink [[Harvey Wallbanger (cocktail)|Harvey Wallbanger]] and the team's manager's name. The Brewers went 72\u201343 under Kuenn for the rest of the season and went wild offensively, clubbing a then club-record 216 home runs during the season. The Brewers alone had three players finish in the top five in the league in home runs with Gorman Thomas, who led the league with 39, Ben Oglivie, who hit 34, and Cecil Cooper, who hit 32. Late in the season, to try to ensure the Brewers' pennant chase, the team made one last trade on August 30 for [[Don Sutton]]. That trade would become even more important on the final game of the regular season between the Brewers and the [[1982 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]], with both teams tied for first place in the AL East. Don Sutton started against [[Jim Palmer]] and the Brewers won 10\u20132, thanks to Robin Yount hitting two clutch home runs, clinching the AL East Division. The Brewers finished the season 95\u201367, the best record in baseball that year.\n\nThe Brewers faced the [[1982 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1982 American League Championship Series]] and lost the first two games in California, but then rallied to win the next two games back in Milwaukee, setting up the pivotal Game 5, with the winner being the American League Champions. Down 3\u20132 in the 7th, Cecil Cooper hit a clutch 2-run single to put the Brewers on top and proved to be a game winner. The Brewers became the first team to win the American League Championship Series when down two games to none.\n\nThe Brewers then played the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1982 World Series|World Series]], which was seen as a match-up of contrasting playing styles, as the Cardinals' offensive style was speed and defense, whereas the Brewers' offense was power hitting. Affectionately called \"The Sud-Way series, [[wordplay]] for [[subway series]] and parodying the two cities as homes of major breweries ([[Miller Brewing Company]] in Milwaukee and [[Anheuser-Busch]] in St. Louis) the Brew Crew won Game One 10\u20130, thanks to [[Paul Molitor]]'s World Series record 5 hits and a complete game shutout by Mike Caldwell. The Cardinals won the next two games and seemed to have Game 4 in complete control until the Brewers rallied for six runs in the 7th to win the game 7\u20135. The Brewers then won Game Five 6\u20134, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead, but the Cardinals trounced Don Sutton winning Game 6 13\u20131, and rallied for three runs late in Game 7 to win the Series, 4 games to 3. Many point to the lack of a bullpen for their downfall, as the Brewers had the lead in five of the seven games. Ace closer [[Rollie Fingers]] missed the playoffs due to a torn muscle in his throwing arm that not only kept him out for the entire playoffs but also would have him miss the entire 1983 season.\n\nThe Brewers had many individual accomplishments during their two playoff years, as both in 1981 and 1982, Brewer players won both the AL MVP and Cy Young Awards, with Rollie Fingers winning both awards in 1981, and Robin Yount winning the MVP and Pete Vuckovich winning the Cy Young in 1982.\n\nThe Brewers were in contention to repeat in 1983, but the team fell on a rough September to finish in 4th place with an 87\u201375 record, their last winning season until 1987. Part of the reason for the Brewers' fall in 1983 was the absence of three main parts of their pennant-winning club the year before. [[Rollie Fingers]] was lost for the whole season with a torn muscle in his throwing arm, beloved slugger [[Gorman Thomas]] struggled badly offensively and was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]], and their ace, [[Pete Vuckovich]], was revealed to have had a torn rotator cuff that had been plaguing him since 1981 and only pitched in 5 games in 1983. Two milestones were reached by Brewers players in 1983, however, when [[Don Sutton]] got his 3,000th career strikeout and [[Ted Simmons]] got his 2,000th career hit. Harvey Kuenn resigned as manager after the season.\n\n===1984\u20131993: Rollercoaster, riding the highs and lows===\nFollowing their two playoff years, the club quickly retreated to the bottom of the standings, never finishing higher than fifth (out of seven) in their division from 1984 to 1986. Hope was restored in 1987 when, guided by rookie manager [[Tom Trebelhorn]], the team began the year with a 13-game winning streak. Unfortunately, they followed that hot start with a 12-game skid in May. But \"Team Streak\" eventually posted a strong third-place finish. Highlights of the year included [[Paul Molitor]]'s 39-game hitting streak and what is still the only [[no-hitter]] in team history, pitched by [[Juan Nieves]] on April 15.\n\nOn that day, Nieves became the first (and so far, only) Brewer and first [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican-born]] Major Leaguer to pitch a no-hitter, defeating the [[1987 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] 7\u20130 at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. The final out came on a climactic diving catch in right-center field by Robin Yount of a line drive hit by [[Eddie Murray]]. The game also was the first time the Orioles were no-hit at Memorial Stadium. Yount later recalled at a Brewers banquet that he did not have to dive to catch the line drive hit by Murray but figured ending the game with a diving catch would be the icing on the cake for Nieves' no-hitter. Part of the Brewers' resurgence came from cultivating a new crop of young stars in their farm system, like pitchers Teddy Higuera and Dan Plesac, and position players B.J. Surhoff, Dale Sveum, and Rob Deer.\n\nIn [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988]] the [[1988 Milwaukee Brewers season|team]] had another strong season, finishing only two games out of first (albeit with a lesser record than the previous year) in a close playoff race with four other clubs. Following this year, the team slipped, posting mediocre records from 1989 through 1991, after which Trebelhorn was fired. In 1992, reminiscent of the resurgence which greeted Trebelhorn's arrival in 1987, the Brewers rallied behind the leadership of rookie manager [[Phil Garner]] and posted their best record since their World Series year in 1982, finishing the season 92\u201370 and in second place, four games behind that year's eventual World Champion [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]]. As a bit of a shocker for Brewers fans, who were used to the team sporting several power hitters, the Brewers in 1992 instead led the American League with 256 ''stolen bases'', while hitting only 82 home runs, with only two players ([[Greg Vaughn]] and Paul Molitor) hitting more than 12 for the year. Despite not making the playoffs, the Brewers had some other memorable moments, as [[Pat Listach]] hit .290 and stole 54 bases while winning the AL Rookie of the Year award, while Robin Yount got his 3000th career hit. 1992 proved to be the end of an era for the Brewers, as teammates [[Robin Yount]], [[Paul Molitor]], and [[Jim Gantner]], who had been together since 1978, would go their separate ways, as Molitor left the Brewers for the Toronto Blue Jays, Gantner retired, and Yount would only last one more season before retiring in 1993.\n\nThe hope of additional pennant races was quickly dashed, as the club plummeted to the bottom of the standings in [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], finishing an abysmal 26 games out of first. Since 1992, highlights were few and far between as the franchise failed to produce a winning season, having not fielded a competitive team because of a combination of bad management and financial constraints that limit the team relative to the resources available to other, larger-market clubs.\n\nAs the 1990s came to a close, the Brewers were on their way to becoming a perennial doormat. A lack of good management and an aging ballpark in old County Stadium, were both becoming stark problems for the Brewers and many fans began to wonder if the Brewers would ever become contenders again.\n\n===1994\u20131998: Taking it National===\nIn 1994, Major League Baseball adopted a new, expanded playoff system. This change would necessitate a restructuring of each league from two divisions into three. The Brewers were transferred from the old AL East division to the newly created AL Central. (Due to the baseball strike, however, the new-look playoffs and [[1994 World Series|World Series]] did not materialize that year.)\n\nIn March 1995, two new franchises\u2014the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]\u2014were awarded by Major League Baseball, to begin play in 1998. It was decided to add one new team to each league. At the time, however, MLB did not want to have an odd number of teams per league because they would either have to give teams many more off-days than in the past, or [[interleague play]] would have to be extended year-round, or both (14 years later however, another realignment would ''cause'' there to be an odd number of teams in each league with year-round interleague play).  In order for MLB officials to continue the existing schedule, where teams play almost every day and where interleague play is limited to a few days per year, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams. The decision was made to have one existing club switch leagues.<ref>''See also'' [[Major League Baseball#League organization]].</ref>\n\nThis realignment was widely considered to have great financial benefit to the club moving.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Commissioner (then club owner) Bud Selig decided another team should have the first chance to switch leagues. The [[Kansas City Royals]] of the American League's Central Division were asked first, but they decided not to move over to the National League's Central Division.<ref name=BrewersSwitch>{{cite news|title=Brewers switch leagues, join Reds in NL Central|url=http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1997/brew110697.html|work=[[The Kentucky Post]] ([[Associated Press]])|publisher=[[E.

At the same time, the [[Detroit Tigers]] agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee).<ref name=BrewersSwitch/> The Tampa Bay Devil Rays joined the AL East and the Arizona Diamondbacks joined the NL West.  Had the Brewers elected not to move to the National League, the [[Minnesota Twins]] would have been offered the opportunity next.<ref>Pappas, Doug, [http://www.roadsidephotos.com/baseball/97-4news.htm \"News Briefs: Fall 1997\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727032139/http://www.roadsidephotos.com/baseball/97-4news.htm |date=2008-07-27 }}, ''Outside the Lines'', Fall 1997.</ref>\n\nMilwaukee had formerly been a National League town, having been the home of the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] for 13 seasons (1953\u201365) until their relocation to Atlanta. With the Brewers having joined the National League, it was now necessary for their pitchers to take batting practice, because the NL has a no DH rule.\n\nCoincidentally, the [[Houston Astros]], who were also in the NL Central at the time of the Brewers' league switch, would join the American League in 2013. That gave the two leagues the same number of teams (15), but necessitated expanded interleague play because of the odd number of teams that were present in each league.\n\n===1999\u20132003: Building Miller Park===\n[[File:Miller Park.jpg|thumbnail|right|270px|[[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], the current home of the Milwaukee Brewers.]]\nAs early as 1993, Brewers owner Bud Selig had talked of a new ballpark for the Brewers to replace [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], which had become heavily outdated and antiquated and didn't even have luxury suites.\n\nBy 1996, the club was set to build a new ballpark near the site of County Stadium, which would have a retractable roof to counter the unpredictable Wisconsin weather in the spring and autumn. It also helped to bring more fans and their families from all around Wisconsin to come to games with a practical guarantee of no rain-outs, bring in more potential revenue for the club.\n\n[[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] was opened in 2001, built to replace Milwaukee County Stadium. The stadium was built with $310 million of public funds, drawing some controversy, and is the only sporting facility to have a fan-shaped retractable roof. Miller Park has a [[seating capacity]] of seating 41,900 and with standing room 43,000, which is 10,000 fewer seats than County Stadium.\n\nThe park was to have opened a year earlier, but an accident during its construction, which resulted in the deaths of three workers, forced a year's delay and $50 million to $75 million in damage. On July 14, 1999, the three men lost their lives when the Lampson \"[[Big Blue (crane)|Big Blue]]\" crane, one of the largest in the world, collapsed while trying to lift a 400-ton right field roof panel. A statue commemorating the men now stands between the home plate entrance to Miller Park and [[Helfaer Field]].\n\nThe Brewers made renovations to Miller Park before the 2006 campaign, adding both [[LED]] scoreboards from [[Daktronics]], a company in [[Brookings, South Dakota]], in left field and on the second-tier of the stadium, as well as a picnic area in right field, shortening the distance of the right-field fence.<ref name=Daktronics>{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx |title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Milwaukee Brewers |access-date=2012-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030103803/http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=2012-10-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The picnic area was an immediate hit and sold out for the season before the year began.\n\nMiller Park also features another fan favorite, [[Sausage Race|The Racing Sausages]], in a race of five costumed mascots, held before the bottom of the sixth inning.\n\nWhile the Brewers' new park was a hit, the club itself was not successful playing in it, as the Brewers finished the season even worse than their previous seasons, going 68\u201394 in their first season at Miller Park. The Brewers finished 2002 even worse, finishing with a dismal 56\u2013106 record, 41 games out of first place, the worst record in franchise history.\n\nIn [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]], the Brewers hired [[Doug Melvin]] as General Manager, who in turn brought in [[Ned Yost]], coach with the Atlanta Braves and a former member of the 1982 American League Champion Brewers, as manager. Though the Brewers only went 68\u201394 in 2003, the Brewers did raise hopes with a winning record in August during the season.\n\n===2004\u2013present: Attanasio era===\n\n====2004\u20132006: Building a winner====\nOn January 16, 2004, Selig announced that his ownership group was putting the team up for sale, to the great relief of many fans who were unhappy with the team's lackluster performance and poor management by his daughter, [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]], over the previous decade. In September 2004, the Brewers announced they had reached a verbal agreement with Los Angeles investment banker [[Mark Attanasio]] to purchase the team for a reported US$223 million. The sale to Attanasio was completed on January 13, 2005, at Major League Baseball's quarterly owners meeting. Other members of Attanasio's ownership group include [[private equity]] investor [[John Canning, Jr.]], David Uihlein, Harris Turer and Stephen Marcus, all of whom were involved with the previous ownership group led by Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2005/03/21/story1.html Attanasio seeks more local owners]. The Business Journal of Milwaukee, March 18, 2005</ref> Since taking over the franchise, Attanasio has worked hard to build bridges with Milwaukee baseball fans, including giving away every seat to the final home game of 2005 free of charge and bringing back the classic \"ball and glove\" logo of the club's glory days on \"Retro Friday\" home games, during which they also wear versions of the team's old pinstriped uniforms.\n\n=====2004=====\n{{main|2004 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nThe Brewers caused a stir in the first half of the 2004 season, when the team had a winning record in the first half of the season, even briefly being in 1st place in the NL Central. However, lack of a productive offense doomed the Brewers and the club sunk back to last place, finishing the season 67\u201394. The Brewers did have some bright moments during the season with pitcher [[Ben Sheets]] striking out 18 Atlanta Braves in one game and the Brewers coming back from a 9-run deficit to beat the [[2004 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].\n\nAfter the 2004 season, with Mark Attanasio now in control of the franchise, the Brewers were finally able to spend some money on free agents. The Brewers first significant free-agent signing in many years was veteran catcher [[Damian Miller]], a Wisconsin native, and to address a need for better run production, the Brewers traded speedy outfielder Scott Podsednik and relief pitcher Luis Vizca\u00edno to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Carlos Lee]]. The arrival of Lee gave Brewer fans even higher hopes that better seasons were on the way for the Brewers.\n[[File:Prince Rickie.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rickie Weeks and Prince Fielder at Spring training, 2005]]\n\n=====2005=====\n{{main|2005 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], under Attanasio's ownership, the team finished 81\u201381 to secure its first non-losing record since 1992. True to form, Carlos Lee provided the Brewers with much needed run support, hitting 32 home runs and driving in 112. Starting pitcher Chris Capuano also had a stellar season, going 18\u201312 with a 3.99 ERA, the most wins by a Brewer pitcher since Pete Vuckovich won 18 games in 1982.\n\nWith a solid base of young talent assembled over the past five years, including [[Prince Fielder]], [[Rickie Weeks]], [[J. J. Hardy]] and [[Corey Hart (baseball)|Corey Hart]], the Brewers showed renewed competitiveness. Further encouraging this sentiment, the Brewers had hired former stars Yount (bench coach; resigned in November 2006) and [[Dale Sveum]] (third base coach), both very popular players for the Brewers in the '80s.\n\n=====2006=====\n{{main|2006 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nIn [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], the Brewers' play disappointed fans, players, and management. They began the season 5\u20131 and had a 14\u201311 record at the end of April. On [[Mother's Day]] Bill Hall hit a walk off home run with his mother in the stands, a play that was shown on ESPN throughout the summer. However, soon starters JJ Hardy, Rickie Weeks, and Corey Koskie were lost to injuries, and the Brewers were forced to trade for veteran infielders [[David Bell (baseball)|David Bell]] and [[Tony Graffanino]]. They also suffered setbacks when losing starting pitchers [[Ben Sheets]] and [[Tomo Ohka]] for a substantial amount of time, forcing Triple A starters [[Ben Hendrickson]], [[Dana Eveland]], [[Carlos Villanueva (baseball)|Carlos Villanueva]], and [[Zach Jackson (pitcher, born 1983)|Zach Jackson]] into starting roles at different points in the year. Shortly before the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star]] break the Brewers climbed to one game above .500, but then lost their next three to the [[Chicago Cubs]] and would never return to .500. After the All Star break closer Derrick Turnbow blew four straight save opportunities. This led to the Brewers being far enough down in the standings that management decided to trade free agent-to-be [[Carlos Lee]] to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for closer [[Francisco Cordero]], outfielder [[Kevin Mench]], and two minor league prospects. Cordero replaced Turnbow as the Brewers closer and had immediate success, converting his first 13 save opportunities. On August 24 the Brewers completed a sweep of the [[2006 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] to climb to less than five games out in both the NL Central Division and NL Wild Card races, but then Milwaukee went on a 10-game losing streak that ended any postseason hope. The Brewers did rebound and play well in September including a four-game sweep of [[2006 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]], but it was too little too late. The Brewers ended the season with a 75\u201387 record.\n\nAt the end of the season, Attanasio stated that he and General Manager Doug Melvin would have to make some decisions about returning players for the 2007 season. With young players waiting in the minor leagues, during the off-season the key additions were starting pitcher and 2006 NLCS MVP [[Jeff Suppan]], starter [[Claudio Vargas]], reliever [[Greg Aquino]], catcher [[Johnny Estrada]], and returning Brewer [[Craig Counsell]]. The Brewers parted ways with 2006 starters [[Doug Davis (pitcher)|Doug Davis]] and Tomo Ohka, as well as fan favorite [[Jeff Cirillo]], who wanted more playing time with another team.\n\n====2007: The return to respectability====\n{{main|2007 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n[[File:Prince Fielder (929557698).jpg|thumb|upright|Prince Fielder]]\n[[File:Ben Sheets 2008-04-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ben Sheets]]\n\nBefore the 2007 season, the buzz surrounding the Brewers greatly increased. They were dubbed a \"sleeper team\" and \"contenders in the NL\" by numerous sports analysts and magazines. ESPN's Peter Gammons and Dan Patrick both picked The Brewers to beat out the defending champion [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] and re-vamped [[2007 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] to win the NL Central. To celebrate the successful 1982 Milwaukee Brewers team, the franchise decided to have the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] be named as the \"25th Anniversary of '82\", with more fan giveaways than any other Major League Baseball team except the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], and more discounts and deals than any other time in Brewers' history.\n\nESPN.com's lead story on August 29 stated: \".... Then there are the Brewers. The strange, impossible-to-figure-out Brewers. They once had the best record in the majors, were 14 games over .500 twice, and led the division by as many as 8\u00bd games on June 23. Since then, and there's no nice way of saying it; they've reeked.\".<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&id=2995727&sportCat=mlb\"Cubs sitting in the driver's seat]</ref> The Brewers cast this negativity to the side, and rebounded in September. Despite poor performances from the usually steady [[Chris Capuano]] and more nagging injuries to [[Ben Sheets]], the Brewers found themselves in a heated pennant race with Chicago's North Siders. The team's playoff drive took a hit late in the year, however, losing three of four games in a crucial series in Atlanta, dropping the Brewers to a season-high 3.5 games out of first. The Brewers won the first two games of their final homestand of the season to pull within two games of the Cubs, but faced a near impossible task with the club's elimination number down to only three and the wild card leading [[2007 San Diego Padres season|Padres]] coming to town. The club played well, but the Cubs clinched on the final Friday of the season. On September 29 the Brewers beat Padres 4\u20133 in extra innings to secure a winning season. The game was tied in the ninth inning by a triple by [[Tony Gwynn, Jr.]] in a highlight reel play that was repeated often during the 2007 post season. That win, and the win the next day, by the Brewers kept the Padres from advancing to the playoffs. The irony, of course, being that Gwynn's [[Tony Gwynn|father]] was arguably the most popular Padre of all-time, and Tony Gwynn, Jr. would later be traded to the Padres in 2009. Milwaukee finished at a respectable 83\u201379, only two games behind Chicago, the club's best finish since 1992.\nFirst baseman [[Prince Fielder]] made history in 2007, becoming the first Brewer and the youngest player ever to reach the 50 home run mark in a single season. For his effort, he finished third in the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player voting, garnering 284 total points including 5 first place votes. Fielder was also awarded the [[Hank Aaron Award]] for reaching the amazing single year record. Third baseman [[Ryan Braun]] was also rewarded for his historic season by being named 2007 NL Rookie of the Year.\n\n====2008: The return to the postseason====\n{{main|2008 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n[[File:DSC03365 Ryan Braun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ryan Braun]], 2008]]\n\nThe Brewers came into 2008 with hopes of ending the team's 26-year playoff drought, adding several veterans to the team in outfielder [[Mike Cameron]] and catcher [[Jason Kendall]], as well as relief pitchers \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 and [[Salom\u00f3n Torres]]. The Brewers started April on a solid winning note, but suffered two big blows in their pitching rotation when [[Dave Bush]] was demoted to AAA Nashville, and [[Yovani Gallardo]] suffered a potential season ending knee injury. The team dropped below .500 by the middle of May, capped off by a sweep from the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nThe Brewers rebounded in June as Salom\u00f3n Torres took over as closer, becoming a big success, and soon climbed back into contention. As June came to a close, the Brewers made their biggest move for playoff contention as they traded 4 prospects, most notably [[Matt LaPorta]], to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for [[CC Sabathia]]. General Manager Doug Melvin summed up the trade by saying, \"We are going for it.\" The Brewers came into the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]] with a 52\u201343 record, still third behind the Cubs and Cardinals. Ben Sheets was named starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star game, and Ryan Braun also started at left field. Corey Hart was named to the team in the Final Vote.\n\nThe Brewers came out of the All-Star break with a bang as they won their first seven games back, all of them on the road, sweeping first the Giants and then the Cardinals, taking over first place in the Wild Card standings. The Brewers came into the end of July still in the hunt for the division, but the front running Cubs swept the Brewers in a four-game set at Miller Park. While the Brewers were still holding on to the Wild Card lead, the division was never seriously challenged for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe Brewers came off the sweep from the Cubs with an amazing August, winning 20 of 28 games in the month. Sabathia made history by becoming the first pitcher in over 90 years to win his first 9 games after being traded mid-season. With a steady five game lead for the Wild Card, the hope of a playoff spot seemed secured, but the Brewers struggled in September, first getting swept by the [[2008 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], and then just over a week later, getting swept in four games by the [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], losing their lead in the Wild Card. Feeling a change was needed, the Brewers fired manager Ned Yost with just 12 games left in the season, replacing him with Brewers third base coach [[Dale Sveum]]. Sveum named Garth Iorg as his replacement as third base coach, and made [[Robin Yount]] the new bench coach, replacing [[Ted Simmons]]. With the final 6x games at home, the Brewers were still in the hunt for the Wild Card behind the New York Mets. They first swept the Pittsburgh Pirates, thanks to walk-off home runs by [[Prince Fielder]] and [[Ryan Braun]], tying the New York Mets for the Wild Card lead with 3 games to go against the NL Central division champion [[2008 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].\n\nThe Brewers took the first game thanks to a pinch-hit home run by [[Rickie Weeks]] and stellar relief pitching by [[Seth McClung]]. The Cubs took the second game, with the Wild Card race still in a dead tie. CC Sabathia was called to pitch his third game in a week, and was stellar, pitching a complete game, while Ryan Braun hit possibly the biggest home run in club history with a 2-run shot in the 8th inning to break a 1\u20131 tie. The Brewers won 3\u20131 while the New York Mets lost to the [[2008 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] 4\u20132, sealing the Brewers the Wild Card spot.\n\n=====2008 NLDS=====\n{{main|2008 National League Division Series}}\n\nThe Brewers finished the 2008 season one game ahead of the New York Mets in the wild card race with a final record of 90\u201372, and faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. This was the first time the Brewers reached the playoffs since 1982.\n\nThe Brewers played their first postseason game in 26 years on October 1. Pitcher [[Yovani Gallardo]] made his first postseason start and only his second start since coming off the disabled list in late September. The Brewers lost the first game of the NLDS 3\u20131 on a dominant performance by Phillies pitcher [[Cole Hamels]]. Hamels allowed only two hits and struck out nine Brewers batters in eight shutout innings. The Brewers mounted a comeback in the 9th inning as closer [[Brad Lidge]] allowed two hits, a walk, and a run to score. However, Brewers right fielder Corey Hart struck out with runners on second and third to end the game.\n\nThe Brewers hosted Game 3, which was the first playoff game ever hosted at Miller Park and the first in Milwaukee since Game 5 of the 1982 World Series. The Brewers won, but were eliminated in Game 4, ending the Brewers season while the Phillies went on to win the World Series.\n\n====2009: Missing playoffs====\n{{main|2009 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nDuring the off-season, the Brewers lost C.C. Sabathia when he filed for free agency and signed a lucrative deal with the [[New York Yankees]]. Despite the loss of a starting pitcher in Sabathia, the Brewers were able to sign all-time [[save (baseball)|save]] leader [[Trevor Hoffman]]. The Brewers were not able to build on their success from the year prior falling below .500 but were witness to Prince Fielder setting the all-time franchise record for RBI.\n\n====2010====\n{{main|2010 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\nThe Brewers attempted to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free agent [[Doug Davis (pitcher)|Doug Davis]], but the Brewers still struggled. After just one month, the Brewers released [[Jeff Suppan]], Doug Davis got injured, and Trevor Hoffman struggled to get saves. The only bright spots of the season was the Brewers' hitting. The Brewers were the only team in baseball to have three players with 100+ RBIs in Ryan Braun, Casey McGehee, and Corey Hart. The Brewers lost 9 games in a row in May and never fully recovered, finishing the season 77\u201385, which was good for 3rd place in the National League Central division, behind the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals. The only other bright spots of the season was Trevor Hoffman getting his 600th career save and the emergence of new closer [[John Axford]]. After the season, the Brewers chose not to renew the contract of manager Ken Macha. In October, just days after the World Series, the Brewers hired [[Ron Roenicke]], bench coach of the Los Angeles Angels, to be the Brewers' new manager.\n\n====2011 season: NL Central champs====\n{{Main|2011 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n[[File:Shaun Marcum at Miller Park, Milwaukee, Wisconsin - 20110612.jpg|thumb|200px|Shaun Marcum, 2011]]\nWith the trades for [[Shaun Marcum]] and [[Zack Greinke]], the Brewers were tabbed by many experts as favorites to not only win the NL Central Division, but also contenders for the National League pennant. The Brewers did suffer some early losses in spring training, as Zack Greinke was lost to a rib injury that would keep him out for a month, and Corey Hart was out for the first half of April with a hamstring injury, which caused the Brewers to make a last-minute trade at the end of spring training for Washington Nationals outfielder Nyjer Morgan.\n\nThe Brewers struggled during the first month of the season, losing their first 4 games of the season and fell as far down as to 5th place in the NL Central Division, but the Brewers rebounded starting at the end of May and throughout June and early July. By the All-Star Break, the Brewers were in 2nd place in the division, behind Pittsburgh and St. Louis. To address some needed bullpen depth, the Brewers made a shocking trade just hours after the All-Star Game, trading two Class-A prospects to the New York Mets for ace reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who immediately became the Brewers set-up reliever for closer John Axford.\n\nThe Brewers went on a hot winning stretch through the month of August and by the beginning of September were 10 1/2 games ahead of St. Louis for the NL Central lead. Though the Brewers scuffled some in September, the Brewers clinched the division on September 26, beating the Florida Marlins 4\u20131. The Brewers finished the season with a 96\u201366 record, the best record in franchise history.\n\nAlong with their team accomplishments, the Brewers had many individual achievements from their players. Ryan Braun finished the season with 33 homers and 33 steals while finishing second in the National League in batting average, hitting .332 while Prince Fielder finished second in the league in both home runs and RBIs, hitting 38 home runs while driving in 120.\n\nThe Brewers starting pitching was also drastically better than 2010. Each of the Brewers 5 regular starters had 10-plus wins during the regular season. Yovani Gallardo won 17 games, the most by a Brewer since 2005, Zack Greinke won 16 games despite missing one month, both Shawn Marcum and Randy Wolf won 13 games, and number five starter Chris Narveson won 11 games. It was the first time since 1982 that the Brewers had five pitchers with 10 or more wins in a season. The Brewers also used fewer starting pitchers than any team in baseball, using only six starting pitchers, with [[Marco Estrada (baseball)|Marco Estrada]] filling in for 7 games when Greinke and later Narveson were out with injuries.\n\n====2011 Postseason====\nThe Brewers faced the NL West Champion Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS and won the first two games at Miller Park, with Yovani Gallardo pitching 8 stellar innings in a 4-1 Game 1 win. The Diamondbacks won games 3 and 4 in Arizona, setting up a deciding Game 5 back in Miller Park. The Brewers had a 2\u20131 lead going into the 9th inning when closer John Axford blew his first save since April, giving up the lead. The Brewers went on to win the game and the series in the 10th inning on a base hit by Nyjer Morgan driving in Carlos Gomez for the winning run. The Brewers faced their divisional foe and the NL Wild Card winner, the St. Louis Cardinals, who had upset the favored Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. Many Brewer fans{{Who|date=June 2012}} welcomed facing the Cardinals with the National League pennant at stake, with the Brewers and Cardinals having a growing rivalry, and also a chance for the Brewers to avenge their 1982 World Series defeat, which was at the hands of the Cardinals. The two teams split the first two games at Miller Park, then the Cardinals took two out of 3 games at Busch Stadium and won Game 6 to win the National League pennant and eventually the World Series against the Texas Rangers. Probably the biggest reason for the Brewers defeat{{According to whom|date=June 2012}} was the downfall of their starting pitching. In their 11 postseason games, the Brewers starting pitchers only had three quality starts, with Yovani Gallardo accounting for two of them, both of which were in the NLDS. The other quality start was Randy Wolf in Game 4 of the NLCS.\n\n====2012====\n{{Main|2012 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\nIn the offseason, the Brewers would lose many of their spot players that had helped them during the season, such as [[Mark Kotsay]], [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], and [[Craig Counsell]] but their most notable loss was that of Prince Fielder, who would leave the team via free agency after having been a part of the Brewers organization for almost a decade. Fielder would end up signing with the Detroit Tigers. The Brewers would make two significant free agent signings during the off-season, signing shortstop Alex Gonzalez and third baseman Aramis Ramierez to improve the left side of the Brewers infield. The Brewers would also sign Japanese outfielder Norichika Aoki to bring some needed outfield depth.\n\nThe biggest news of all during the off-season, though, was the issue of the reigning NL MVP Ryan Braun apparently testing positive for PED's and facing a possible 50-game suspension. Braun would appeal the suspension and won on the basis that the test was not processed properly, making him the first player to win an appeal against a suspension regarding illegal substances.\n\nDespite the offseason losses and controversies, the Brewers fans still looked forward to the 2012 season with great optimism, as the Brewers, by the end of February, had sold over 1.5 million tickets, the most before the month of March. However, the Brewers started the season poorly, with a 40\u201345 record by the All-Star break.<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=320708118&teams=milwaukee-brewers-vs-houston-astros</ref> Poor bullpen play put the team even further out of contention by the end of July, which caused the Brewers to trade ace pitcher [[Zack Greinke]] to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in exchange for top minor league shortstop Jean Segura and two minor league relief pitchers.\n\nSuddenly, in mid-August, the Brewers went on a run to put themselves back in postseason contention. The bullpen started to turn itself around and the team was able to get production from several minor league call-ups, like [[Mike Fiers]], [[Martin Maldonado]], [[Jeff Bianchi]], and [[Wily Peralta]]. Combined with stellar hitting of [[Ryan Braun]], [[Aramis Ram\u00edrez]], [[Corey Hart (baseball)|Corey Hart]], and [[Jonathan Lucroy]], the Brewers, from August 16 to September 23, won 26 of 35 games. However, the Brewers were eliminated from postseason contention on September 30, a 7\u20130 loss to the [[Houston Astros]].\n\nThe Brewers still finished with a winning record in 2012, going 83\u201379, finishing in 3rd place in the NL Central behind Cincinnati and St. Louis.\n\n====2013====\nThe Brewers hoped to become contenders again in 2013, and tried to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free-agent [[Kyle Lohse]], but the Brewers, after starting off well with a 14\u201311 record in April, fell flat with a 6\u201322 mark in May, and never regained momentum, finishing the season 74\u201388.\n\nFurther compounding the Brewers' fall during the season were nagging injuries to Aramis Ram\u00edrez, and also Ryan Braun's supposed involvement with the Biogenesis scandal, which resulted in Braun being suspended for the final 60 games of the regular season after he admitted to taking PEDs during the 2011 playoffs. Major League Baseball didn't force Braun to surrender his 2011 National League MVP award.\n\nOn the field, the Brewers did have several individual performances that gave fans some hope for the coming seasons. Shortstop Jean Segura finished second in the National League with 44 stolen bases, and Carlos Gomez had a breakout season, batting .284 with 24 home runs, 40 stolen bases, and became the first Brewer since 1982 to win a Gold Glove award for his defensive play, and catcher Jonathan Lucroy had a stellar offensive season, hitting 18 home runs and driving in 82 RBIs.\n\n====2014====\nFew experts considered the Brewers as contenders in the NL Central for 2014, even after the Brewers signed another free-agent starting pitcher in [[Matt Garza]]; most expected the Brewers to finish no better than 4th in the division. The team also improved their bullpen with resigning Francisco Rodriguez as closer, trading outfielder Nori Aoki to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for a young pitcher in Will Smith, and signing veteran slugging first baseman Mark Reynolds.\n\nThe Brewers started the season hot, going 20\u20137 in April, much to the surprise of many. The Brewers have showed much improved starting pitching, with a steady rotation in Yovani Gallardo, Kyle Lohse, Matt Garza, Wily Peralta, and Marco Estrada. In addition, Francisco Rodriguez regained his old form, successfully closing out his first 17 saves of the season, and Will Smith became virtually untouchable, sporting a 0.88 ERA in the first two months of the season.\n\nThough the Brewers showed some struggles in the months of May and July, the team continued to stay on top of the standings as one of the better teams in the National League, helped by an 18\u201310 record in June. By mid September, however, they had lost their division lead to the St. Louis Cardinals and were trailing behind the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card race.\n\nThe Brewers were in first place in the division from April 5 to September 1, but ultimately finished third in the division after a sub-.500 September, barely getting over .500 with an 82\u201380 record.<ref>http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/epic-collapse-forces-hard-look-everywhere-b99363945z1-278142131.html</ref>\n\nA couple of standout performers for the Brewers came from Jonathon Lucroy, who finished with a .301 batting average and led the National League with 53 doubles and set a new Major League record for doubles by a catcher in a season with 48. Second-year pitcher Wily Peralta had a 17\u201311 record, while Kyle Lohse had a 13\u20139 record with 2 complete game shutouts.\n\n====2015====\nThe offseason for the Brewers was relatively quiet, with only a couple of trades made where the Brewers parted with two starting pitchers. [[Marco Estrada (baseball)|Marco Estrada]] was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for first baseman [[Adam Lind]],<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11802384/toronto-blue-jays-trade-adam-lind-milwaukee-brewers-marco-estrada</ref> and [[Yovani Gallardo]], after 8 seasons with the Brewers and becoming the franchise's all-time strikeout leader, was traded to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/01/19/rangers-acquire-yovani-gallardo-in-trade/21932721/</ref> During the offseason, [[Ryan Braun]], who had his worst season ever during 2014 (.266 avg., 19 HR, and 81 RBI's), had surgery on his right thumb,<ref>http://www.brewcrewball.com/2014/10/2/6894993/ryan-braun-surgery-thumb-brewers-cryotherapy</ref> which had bothered him all during the season and was thought to be the reason behind his dismal numbers. On the field, the Brewers' season went south almost immediately, going 5\u201317 in the month of April. On May 4, manager Ron Roenicke was fired and Craig Counsell was named interim manager, staying manager for the Brewers through the rest of the season, as the team finished 68\u201394.\n\n====2016: Rebuilding====\nThe Brewers began a mode of rebuilding the team, with Doug Melvin stepping down as general manager and being replaced with Houston Astros assistant GM, [[David Stearns]]. Stearns kept interim manager [[Craig Counsell]], making him the Brewers full-time manager, and traded away over half of the Brewers' 40-man roster from 2015 before the 2016 season came to a close. The Brewers finished the 2016 season with a 73\u201389 record, but had a 41\u201340 record at home, and had two players lead the National League in major offensive categories, with infielder [[Jonathan Villar]] leading the NL, and all of Major League Baseball, with 62 stolen bases, and first baseman Chris Carter tied for the NL lead in home runs, with 41. Ryan Braun also had a rebound season, with a .305 batting average, 30 home runs, 91 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases. The Brewers also traded away many franchise stars in exchange for prospects, such as Jonathan Lucroy and Carlos Gomez, and other starters, with the exception of Ryan Braun.\n\n====2017====\nThe Brewers came into 2017 with minimal expectations other than continuing their rebuilding of the team. The team surprised many by finishing the month of April at .500, with encouraging performances from Eric Thames, Chase Anderson, Jesus Aguilar, and Travis Shaw. The Brewers continued to stay around .500 for the next two months, and took advantage of the struggles of the Cubs and Cardinals, and started July with a hot 7\u20132 start, putting the Brewers at 50-41 for the season, 5.5 games ahead of the Cubs in the NL Central at the All-Star break. The Brewers struggled after the All-Star break, going 3-11 for the rest of July, followed by a 6-game losing streak in the middle of August. The Brewers still stayed in the race for the Wild Card game, but fell short of the postseason and the NL Central Division, with an 86\u201376 record, which still was a surprise for many in the baseball community.\n\n====2018====\nWith the opportunity to build off their surprising 2017 run, Brewers GM David Stearns worked on stocking up the Brewers roster for 2018, including signing pitchers Jhoulys Chacin and Junior Guerra, and outfielder Lorenzo Cain, who had originally started his MLB career in Milwaukee. The Brewers also traded for another outfielder, Christian Yelich, for four minor leaguers. The Brewers started 2018 well, helped by a stretch in May where they went 19\u20138 to put themselves on top in the NL Central division, taking advantage, once again, of early struggles for both the Cubs and Cardinals. However, the team struggled again in the middle of the season, going 40-39 through the months of June, July, and August. However, they were still in the playoff hunt, leading in the Wild Card, but were still 5 games behind the division-leading Cubs going into the final month of the season. The Brewers got hot again, going 19\u20137 in September, including winning 10 of their last 11 games, the last 8 in a row, to catch the Cubs. Christian Yelich led the offense, going on an offensive tear, including hitting clutch home runs in two of the final three games of the season against the Detroit Tigers. The Brewers tied the Cubs for the NL Central lead, resulting in a one-game playoff for the division title. The Brewers won 3\u20131, clinching their second division title of the decade, and only their 3rd in franchise history, finishing with a 96\u201367 record, tying the franchise record for wins in a season. The Brewers continued their hot run in the NLDS, against the Colorado Rockies, sweeping them in three games to advance to the NLCS, also achieving at least 12 wins in a row for only the second time in their history. The Brewers faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, but the Brewers were unable to keep their late momentum, as the Dodgers bullpen was able to quiet the Brewers' bats, winning the National League pennant in seven games.\n\n====2019====\nFollowing their amazing 2018 campaign, GM David Stearns worked more on adding more talent to the Brewers roster, including signing free agent catcher [[Yasmani Grandal]] and third baseman [[Mike Moustakas]], each on one year contracts. The Brewers headed into the month of September with an overall record of 69\u201366, being four games behind the Cubs for the second wild card spot and trailing the Cardinals by six and a half games for the division lead. On September 25, the Brewers beat the Cincinnati Reds 9\u20132 to clinch a postseason spot for the sixth time in franchise history, knocking the Cubs out of playoff contention. It was also the first time the Brewers had made the postseason for a consecutive season since 1982. But in their final three regular season games, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies at [[Coors Field]], which lead to the Brewers finishing 20\u20137 in September, 89-73 for the regular season, and finishing two games behind the NL Central Champion Cardinals. They ended up taking the second spot in the wild card. Therefore, the Brewers faced the eventual World Champion Washington Nationals in the NL wild card game in Washington D.C., where they lost 4\u20133.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Peter Filichia, ''Professional Baseball Franchises'', Facts on File Press, 1993.\n*Philip J.

Some were known as the \"Creams\" or \"Cream Citys\" after the [[Cream City brick|distinctive brick]] which gave Milwaukee its nickname, others were known as the \"Brewers\", in reference to one of the city's chief industries.\n\nThis chart is a brief overview of the various Milwaukee professional baseball clubs:\n\n*1876-77 '''Milwaukee West Ends''' or '''West End Club''' independent (1876), '''League Alliance''' (1877), home games at '''West End Grounds''' on \"Wells Avenue, near the city limits.\" (Benson, p.&nbsp;231).\n*1878 [[Milwaukee Grays]] a.k.a.

That would change with Milwaukee's entry into the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]], which would last fifty years and provide the city's springboard into the major leagues.\n\n===The American Association===\nThe American Association Milwaukee Brewers were founded in 1901, after the [[American League]] Brewers moved to St. Louis and became the [[St. Louis Browns]]. The modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original [[Milwaukee Brewers]] of the [[minor league|minor]] [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the [[American League]] in 1900. At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues).  Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league.  As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't either fold or move (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). During the first American League season, they finished dead last with a record of 48\u201389. During its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Brewers did not win their first American Association championship until 1913, then repeated the next year. Over 20 years would pass before they claimed another with a 90-64 club in 1936 as a Detroit affiliate. In 1944, the team won again, placing the team in the top 100. Three years later, the Brewers became a farm team of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. Although this move eventually paved the way for the team's demise, in the short run it led directly to Milwaukee's final two league championships\u2014one in 1951 when they also won the Junior World Series, followed by an even better team the next year.\n\n===Bill Veeck and Jolly Cholly===\nIn 1941 the club was purchased by [[Bill Veeck]] (son of former [[Chicago Cubs]] president [[William Veeck, Sr.]]), in a partnership with former Cubs star [[Charlie Grimm]]. Under Veeck's ownership, the Brewers would become one of the most colorful squads in baseball and Veeck would be become one of the game's premiere showmen.  Constantly creating new promotional gimmicks, Veeck gave away live animals, scheduled morning games for wartime night shift workers, staged weddings at home plate, and even sent Grimm a birthday cake containing a much-needed left-handed pitcher.\n\nWhen Grimm was hired as the manager of the Cubs, he recommended that [[Casey Stengel]] be hired to replace him. Veeck was opposed to the idea \u2013 Stengel had little success in his previous managerial stints with the Dodgers and Braves \u2013 but as Veeck was stationed overseas in the Marine Corps, Grimm won out.  The club went on to win the 1944 American Association pennant, and Stengel's managerial career was resurrected.\n\nIn 1945, after winning three pennants in five years, Veeck sold his interest in the Brewers for a $275,000 profit.\n\n===The coming of the Braves===\nMilwaukee had long been coveted by major league teams looking for a new home. Bill Veeck himself tried to relocate the [[St. Louis Browns]] back to Milwaukee in the late 1940s, but his move was vetoed by the other American League owners. Eventually, they relocated to Baltimore, where they became the current edition of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\nThe city of Milwaukee, hoping to attract a major league club, constructed [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] for the 1953 season. The Brewers were set to move in, until Spring training of 1953, when [[Lou Perini]] moved his [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] to Milwaukee. The Brewers moved to Toledo, where they became the next incarnation of the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].  The new Mud Hens continued their winning ways, claiming an American Association pennant in their first season in Ohio.\n\n===Legacy \u2013 return of the Brewers===\nThe legacy of the American Association Milwaukee Brewers continues in the [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[Milwaukee Brewers]], which took its name from the 1902\u20131952 club.\n\nAfter the Braves moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1966, local automobile dealer and Braves part-owner [[Bud Selig]] created a group to lobby for a new major league club in Milwaukee.  As a name for his group, he chose \"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.\", after the American Association club he grew up watching.  As a logo, he chose the [[Beer Barrel Man]] in navy and red \u2013 traditional Brewers colors.\n\nWhen Selig bought the one-year-old [[Seattle Pilots]] franchise in the spring of 1970, he moved them to Milwaukee and they officially became the \"new\" major-league [[Milwaukee Brewers]].  The club continued to use the Beer Barrel Man as the team's primary logo until 1978, although due to time constraints, the team continued to use the old Pilots' colors of blue and gold.  Recently, it has seen a resurgence on throwback merchandise, and been featured on several stadium promotions.\n\nThe current Brewers have played in the [[National League]] since [[1998 in baseball|1998]], when the franchise switched over from the [[American League]] after 29 years in the \"Junior Circuit\" as both the Pilots and the Brewers.\n\n===American Association championships===\n*1913\n*1914\n*1936\n*1944\n*1951\n*1952\n\n===Junior World Series appearances===\nThe [[Junior World Series]] was held between the champions of the American Association and the [[International League]].\n*1936 \u2013 defeated Buffalo, 4 games to 1\n*1947 \u2013 defeated Syracuse, 4 games to 3\n*1951 \u2013 defeated Montreal, 4 games to 2\n\n===Ballpark===\n[[Image:Borchert county postcard.jpg|thumb|225px|Postcard advertising the \"new home\" of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1953]]\nDuring its 51-year tenure in the American Association, Milwaukee played in the same ballpark. Originally constructed in 1888, it was located in the North side of Milwaukee on a rectangular city block with the main entrance on Chambers St. between Eighth and Ninth Streets. It had abnormally short foul lines, {{convert|268|ft}} to left and right. The fences then angled out sharply, making for deep \"power alleys\" and center field was {{convert|400|ft}} from home plate. It was known as Athletic Park until 1928 when it was renamed [[Borchert Field]] in honor of Brewers owner Otto Borchert, who had died the previous year.  The [[Polo Grounds]] had a similar configuration. 'Borchert Orchard' was also the first Milwaukee home park for the [[Green Bay Packers]], who played the [[New York Giants]] on Oct. 1, 1933. The following year, the Packers moved their Milwaukee games to the Wisconsin State Fair Grounds. [[Interstate 43]] now runs through where Borchert Field once stood.\n\n==The modern Brewers ==\n\n===1966&ndash;1969: \"Home of the Braves?\"===\nIn an effort to prevent the relocation of the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] to a larger television market, Braves minority owner [[Bud Selig]], a Milwaukee-area car dealer, formed an organization named '''\"Teams Inc.\"''' devoted to local control of the club.  He successfully prevented the majority owners of the Braves from moving the club in 1964 but was unable to do more than delay the inevitable.  The Braves relocated to [[Atlanta]] after the 1965 season, and Teams Inc. turned its focus to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.\n\n[[Image:1969 Milwaukee Sox.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Program for a 1969 [[Chicago White Sox]] game played in Milwaukee]]Selig doggedly pursued this goal, attending owners meetings in the hopes of securing an expansion franchise.  Selig changed the name of his group to '''\"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club Inc.\"'''.  The \"Brewers\" name, honoring Milwaukee's [[brewing|beer-brewing]] tradition, also was traditional for Milwaukee baseball teams going back into the 19th century.  The city had hosted a major league team by that name in 1901, which relocated at the end of that season to become the St. Louis Browns (now the [[Baltimore Orioles]]).  From 1902 through 1952, a minor league [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Milwaukee Brewers]] club in the [[American Association 20th century|American Association]] had been so successful that it lured the Braves from [[Boston]].  Selig himself had grown up watching that minor league team at [[Borchert Field]] and intended his new franchise to follow in that tradition.\n\nTo demonstrate there still was support for big-league ball in Milwaukee, Selig's group contracted with [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Arthur Allyn, Jr.|Arthur Allyn]] to host nine [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] home games at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in 1968.  A 1967 exhibition game between the White Sox and [[Minnesota Twins]] had attracted more than 51,000 spectators, and Selig was convinced the strong Milwaukee fan base would demonstrate the city would provide a good home for a new club.\n\nThe experiment was staggeringly successful \u2013 those nine games drew 264,297 fans.  In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 72 home games.  In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly ''one-third'' of the total attendance at White Sox games.  In light of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed County Stadium would host Sox home games again the next season.\n\nIn 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the time).  Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year \u2013 over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per game).  Selig felt this fan support lent legitimacy to his quest for a Milwaukee franchise, and he went into the 1968 owners meetings with high hopes.\n\nThose hopes were dashed when [[National League]] franchises were awarded to [[San Diego]] (the [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]) and [[Montreal]] (the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]]), and [[American League]] franchises were awarded to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (the [[Kansas City Royals|Royals]]) and [[Seattle]] (the Pilots). That last franchise, however, would figure very prominently in Selig's future.\n\nHaving failed to gain a major league franchise for Milwaukee through expansion, Selig turned his efforts to purchasing and relocating an existing club.  His search began close to home, with the White Sox themselves.  According to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with Allyn to purchase the Pale Hose and move them north.  The American League, unwilling to surrender Chicago to the [[National League]], vetoed the sale, and Allyn sold the franchise to his brother [[John Allyn|John]].\n\nFrustrated in these efforts, Selig shifted his focus to another American League team, the expansion Seattle Pilots.\n\n===1969&ndash;70: Roots in Seattle===\n{{see also|Seattle Pilots|1969 Seattle Pilots season}}\nSeattle initially had a lot going for it when it joined the American League in 1969. Like Milwaukee, Seattle had long been a hotbed for [[minor league baseball]] and was home to the [[Seattle Rainiers]], one of the pillars of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL).  The [[Cleveland Indians]] had almost moved to Seattle in the early 1960s.  Many of the same things that attracted the Indians made Seattle a plum choice for an expansion team.  Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast (behind Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area).  The addition of a third team on the West Coast also would balance out the addition of Kansas City.  Also, there was no real competition from other pro teams.  While Seattle had just landed the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Seattle SuperSonics|SuperSonics]], the NBA was not in the same class as baseball was in terms of popularity at the time.\n\nThe front man for the franchise was [[Dewey Soriano]], a former Rainiers [[pitcher]] and general manager and former president of the PCL.  In an ominous sign of things to come, Soriano had to ask [[William R. Daley]], who had owned the Indians at the time they flirted with Seattle, to furnish much of the expansion fee.  In return, Daley bought 47 percent of the stock\u2014the largest stake in the club.  He became chairman of the board while Soriano served as president.\n\nHowever, a couple of factors were beyond the Pilots' control. They (alongside with the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres and Kansas City Royals) were originally not set to start play until 1971. But the date was moved up to 1969 under pressure from [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Stuart Symington]] of [[Missouri]].  Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City for all but two years in the 20th century until the [[Oakland Athletics|A's]] left for [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] after the 1967 season, and the prospect of having Kansas City wait three years for its return was not acceptable to Symington. Also, the Pilots had to pay the PCL $1 million to compensate for the loss of one of its most successful franchises. After [[King County, Washington|King County]] voters approved a bond for a domed stadium (what would become the [[Kingdome]], which opened in 1976) in 1968, the Seattle Pilots were officially born. [[California Angels]] executive [[Marvin Milkes]] was hired as general manager, and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] coach [[Joe Schultz]] became manager.\n\nTo the surprise of no one outside Seattle (Schultz and Milkes actually thought they could finish third in the newly formed AL West), the Pilots were terrible. They won their very first game, and then their home opener three days later, but only won five more times in the first month and never recovered. They finished last in the West with a record of 64&ndash;98, 33 games out of first.\n\nHowever, the team's poor play was the least of its troubles. The most obvious problem was [[Sick's Stadium]]. The longtime home of the Rainiers, it had been considered one of the best ballparks in minor league baseball. By the 1960s, however, it was considered far behind the times. While a condition of MLB awarding the Pilots to Seattle was that Sick's had to be expanded to 30,000 seats by the start of the 1969 season, only 17,000 seats were ready due to numerous delays. The scoreboard wasn't even ready until the eve of opening day. While it was expanded to 25,000 by June, the added seats had obstructed views. Water pressure was almost nonexistent after the seventh inning, especially with crowds above 10,000. Attendance was so poor (678,000) that the Pilots were almost out of money by the end of the season. The team's new stadium was slated to be built at the [[Seattle Center]], but a petition by stadium opponents ground the project to a halt.  By the end of the season, it was obvious that the Pilots would not survive long enough to move to their new stadium without new ownership.  It was also obvious that the move would have to happen quickly, as Sick's Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use.\n\nDuring the offseason, Soriano crossed paths with Selig.  They met in secret for over a month after the end of the season, and during Game 1 of the [[1969 World Series|World Series]], Soriano agreed to sell the Pilots to Selig for $10 million to $13 million (depending on the source). Selig would then move the team to Milwaukee and rename it the Brewers. However, the owners turned it down in the face of pressure from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s two senators, [[Warren Magnuson]] and [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry (Scoop) Jackson]], as well as state attorney general [[Slade Gorton]]. MLB asked Soriano and Daley to find a local buyer. Local theater chain owner Fred Danz came forward in October 1969 with a $10 million deal, but it fizzled when the [[Bank of California]] called in a $4 million loan it had made to Soriano and Daley for startup costs. In January 1970, [[Westin Hotels]] owner Eddie Carlson put together a nonprofit group to buy the team. However, the owners rejected the idea almost out of hand since it would have devalued the other clubs' worth. A more traditional deal came one vote short of approval.\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Al 1969 seattle.gif|thumb|100px|Pilots uniforms]] -->After a winter and spring full of court action, the Pilots reported for spring training under new manager [[Dave Bristol]] unsure of where they would play. The owners had given tentative approval to the Milwaukee group, but the state of Washington got an injunction on March 17 to stop the deal. Soriano immediately filed for bankruptcy \u2013 a move intended to forestall any post-sale legal action. At the bankruptcy hearing a week later, Milkes testified there wasn't enough money to pay the coaches, players and office staff. Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players, they would have all become free agents and left Seattle without a team for the 1970 season. With this in mind, Federal Bankruptcy Referee Sidney Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on April 1 \u2013 six days before Opening Day \u2013 clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team's equipment had been sitting in [[Provo, Utah]] with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee.\n\nMuch of the story of the Seattle Pilots' only year in existence is told in [[Jim Bouton]]'s classic baseball book, ''[[Ball Four]]''.\n\nThe Pilots were eventually replaced by another expansion team, the [[Seattle Mariners]], who began play in 1977.\n\n===1970-1977: Early years in Milwaukee===\nWith the season's opening day only six days away, there was not enough time to order completely new uniforms, so the club had to remove the Pilots logo from team uniforms and replace them with Brewers logos. In fact, the outline of the old Pilots logo could still be seen on the Brewers' uniforms. Selig's original intention had been to adopt navy and red as the team colors, hearkening back to the minor league club (souvenir buttons sold at White Sox games at County Stadium featured the major league club's logo in that color combination), but with no time to order new uniforms, the Brewers adopted the blue and gold of the Pilots as their own. That color combination, in various shades, is still used by the club. The short notice (along with their geographical location) also forced the Brewers to assume the Pilots' old place in the AL West. While this resulted in natural rivalries with the White Sox and Twins, it also meant the Brewers faced some very long road trips, traveling to the Angels and Athletics for three series each per season (although this was no worse than the National League's [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] having to play nine series per season in California  as members of the NL West).\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Brewers' 1970 season was over before it started, and they finished 65\u201397. They would not have a winning season until 1978.\n\nSelig brought back former Milwaukee Braves catcher (and fan favorite) [[Del Crandall]] in 1972 to manage the club. In 1972, the Brewers were shifted to the AL East when the second edition of the Washington Senators moved to [[Arlington, Texas]] and became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].\n\nIt was during this period that Milwaukee County Stadium gained its reputation for fun as well as baseball.  Then-team vice president Dick Hackett hired Frank Charles to play the Wurlitzer organ during the games, and Hackett introduced team mascots [[Bernie Brewer|Bernie]] and [[Bonnie Brewer]].\n\nOn November 2, 1974, the Brewers orchestrated a trade that brought one of the most beloved Braves back to Milwaukee, sending outfielder [[Dave May]] and a player to be named later (minor league pitcher [[Roger Alexander]]) to Atlanta for [[Hank Aaron]]. Although not the player he was in his prime, Aaron brought prestige to the young club, and the opportunity to be a [[designated hitter]] allowed Aaron to extend his playing career two more seasons.\n\n===1978\u20131983: The Glory Years of Bambi's Bombers and Harvey's Wallbangers===\nFollowing the 1977 season, the Brewers made two big hires that turned the previously underachieving Brewers into perennial contenders. Harry Dalton was hired as the club's General Manager and he, in turn, hired Baltimore Orioles pitching coach [[George Bamberger]] as the Brewers' third manager in their brief history. Bamberger immediately turned the [[1978 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] into pennant contenders in [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]]. The team won 93 games, an astonishing 26 game improvement from the previous season. The Brewers finished in 3rd place in the AL East, 6.5 games behind the first place New York Yankees. GM Harry Dalton was able to build a winning club with a combination of home-grown players like [[Robin Yount]], [[Paul Molitor]], and [[Gorman Thomas]], as well as getting players that were cast-offs from other teams that became major contributors like [[Cecil Cooper]], [[Ben Oglivie]], and [[Mike Caldwell (baseball)|Mike Caldwell]].\n\nThe [[1979 Major League Baseball season|next season]], [[1979 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee]] won 95 games and finished second in the East behind the [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] on the strength of their home run power, led by Oglivie (who led the league in homers in 1980 along with [[Reggie Jackson]]), Cooper, and Thomas (who hit a then club-record 45 home runs in 1979, since broken by [[Prince Fielder]], who hit 50 homers in 2007). Because of the team's slugging ability and the nickname of their manager Bamberger, the Brewers were nicknamed \"Bambi's Bombers.\"\n\nAs [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]] began, the [[1980 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] and their fans were optimistic about becoming pennant winners, but the team scuffled during the season, partially due to manager George Bamberger suffering a heart attack and having to be replaced by Buck Rodgers. The Brewers fell back to 3rd place in 1980, largely due to a lack of an effective bullpen. Determined to get a proven relief pitcher, general manager Harry Dalton made a huge offseason trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, trading outfielder [[Sixto Lezcano]] and 3 minor league pitchers to the Cardinals in exchange for [[Rollie Fingers]], [[Pete Vuckovich]], and [[Ted Simmons]], all of whom became key parts of the Brewers future success.\n\nThe [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] won the second half of the 1981 season (divided because of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]) and played the [[1981 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in a [[1981 American League Division Series|playoff mini-series]] they ultimately lost. It was the first playoff appearance for the franchise. Rollie Fingers had one of the greatest seasons for a relief pitcher that season, saving 28 games in the shortened season and sporting an astonishing 1.04 ERA, earning him both the MVP and Cy Young Awards in the American League.\n\nIn [[1982 Major League Baseball season|1982]], the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] were considered heavy favorites to win the AL East, but by June, the team had fallen to 23\u201324 and signs had shown that the players were having problems playing under manager Buck Rodgers. Taking a gamble, the Brewers fired Rodgers and replaced him with hitting coach [[Harvey Kuenn]]. The team immediately excelled under Kuenn's low-key managerial style and gained a new nickname as Harvey's Wallbangers, a play on the drink [[Harvey Wallbanger (cocktail)|Harvey Wallbanger]] and the team's manager's name. The Brewers went 72\u201343 under Kuenn for the rest of the season and went wild offensively, clubbing a then club-record 216 home runs during the season. The Brewers alone had three players finish in the top five in the league in home runs with Gorman Thomas, who led the league with 39, Ben Oglivie, who hit 34, and Cecil Cooper, who hit 32. Late in the season, to try to ensure the Brewers' pennant chase, the team made one last trade on August 30 for [[Don Sutton]]. That trade would become even more important on the final game of the regular season between the Brewers and the [[1982 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]], with both teams tied for first place in the AL East. Don Sutton started against [[Jim Palmer]] and the Brewers won 10\u20132, thanks to Robin Yount hitting two clutch home runs, clinching the AL East Division. The Brewers finished the season 95\u201367, the best record in baseball that year.\n\nThe Brewers faced the [[1982 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1982 American League Championship Series]] and lost the first two games in California, but then rallied to win the next two games back in Milwaukee, setting up the pivotal Game 5, with the winner being the American League Champions. Down 3\u20132 in the 7th, Cecil Cooper hit a clutch 2-run single to put the Brewers on top and proved to be a game winner. The Brewers became the first team to win the American League Championship Series when down two games to none.\n\nThe Brewers then played the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1982 World Series|World Series]], which was seen as a match-up of contrasting playing styles, as the Cardinals' offensive style was speed and defense, whereas the Brewers' offense was power hitting. Affectionately called \"The Sud-Way series, [[wordplay]] for [[subway series]] and parodying the two cities as homes of major breweries ([[Miller Brewing Company]] in Milwaukee and [[Anheuser-Busch]] in St. Louis) the Brew Crew won Game One 10\u20130, thanks to [[Paul Molitor]]'s World Series record 5 hits and a complete game shutout by Mike Caldwell. The Cardinals won the next two games and seemed to have Game 4 in complete control until the Brewers rallied for six runs in the 7th to win the game 7\u20135. The Brewers then won Game Five 6\u20134, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead, but the Cardinals trounced Don Sutton winning Game 6 13\u20131, and rallied for three runs late in Game 7 to win the Series, 4 games to 3. Many point to the lack of a bullpen for their downfall, as the Brewers had the lead in five of the seven games. Ace closer [[Rollie Fingers]] missed the playoffs due to a torn muscle in his throwing arm that not only kept him out for the entire playoffs but also would have him miss the entire 1983 season.\n\nThe Brewers had many individual accomplishments during their two playoff years, as both in 1981 and 1982, Brewer players won both the AL MVP and Cy Young Awards, with Rollie Fingers winning both awards in 1981, and Robin Yount winning the MVP and Pete Vuckovich winning the Cy Young in 1982.\n\nThe Brewers were in contention to repeat in 1983, but the team fell on a rough September to finish in 4th place with an 87\u201375 record, their last winning season until 1987. Part of the reason for the Brewers' fall in 1983 was the absence of three main parts of their pennant-winning club the year before. [[Rollie Fingers]] was lost for the whole season with a torn muscle in his throwing arm, beloved slugger [[Gorman Thomas]] struggled badly offensively and was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]], and their ace, [[Pete Vuckovich]], was revealed to have had a torn rotator cuff that had been plaguing him since 1981 and only pitched in 5 games in 1983. Two milestones were reached by Brewers players in 1983, however, when [[Don Sutton]] got his 3,000th career strikeout and [[Ted Simmons]] got his 2,000th career hit. Harvey Kuenn resigned as manager after the season.\n\n===1984\u20131993: Rollercoaster, riding the highs and lows===\nFollowing their two playoff years, the club quickly retreated to the bottom of the standings, never finishing higher than fifth (out of seven) in their division from 1984 to 1986. Hope was restored in 1987 when, guided by rookie manager [[Tom Trebelhorn]], the team began the year with a 13-game winning streak. Unfortunately, they followed that hot start with a 12-game skid in May. But \"Team Streak\" eventually posted a strong third-place finish. Highlights of the year included [[Paul Molitor]]'s 39-game hitting streak and what is still the only [[no-hitter]] in team history, pitched by [[Juan Nieves]] on April 15.\n\nOn that day, Nieves became the first (and so far, only) Brewer and first [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican-born]] Major Leaguer to pitch a no-hitter, defeating the [[1987 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] 7\u20130 at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. The final out came on a climactic diving catch in right-center field by Robin Yount of a line drive hit by [[Eddie Murray]]. The game also was the first time the Orioles were no-hit at Memorial Stadium. Yount later recalled at a Brewers banquet that he did not have to dive to catch the line drive hit by Murray but figured ending the game with a diving catch would be the icing on the cake for Nieves' no-hitter. Part of the Brewers' resurgence came from cultivating a new crop of young stars in their farm system, like pitchers Teddy Higuera and Dan Plesac, and position players B.J. Surhoff, Dale Sveum, and Rob Deer.\n\nIn [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988]] the [[1988 Milwaukee Brewers season|team]] had another strong season, finishing only two games out of first (albeit with a lesser record than the previous year) in a close playoff race with four other clubs. Following this year, the team slipped, posting mediocre records from 1989 through 1991, after which Trebelhorn was fired. In 1992, reminiscent of the resurgence which greeted Trebelhorn's arrival in 1987, the Brewers rallied behind the leadership of rookie manager [[Phil Garner]] and posted their best record since their World Series year in 1982, finishing the season 92\u201370 and in second place, four games behind that year's eventual World Champion [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]]. As a bit of a shocker for Brewers fans, who were used to the team sporting several power hitters, the Brewers in 1992 instead led the American League with 256 ''stolen bases'', while hitting only 82 home runs, with only two players ([[Greg Vaughn]] and Paul Molitor) hitting more than 12 for the year. Despite not making the playoffs, the Brewers had some other memorable moments, as [[Pat Listach]] hit .290 and stole 54 bases while winning the AL Rookie of the Year award, while Robin Yount got his 3000th career hit. 1992 proved to be the end of an era for the Brewers, as teammates [[Robin Yount]], [[Paul Molitor]], and [[Jim Gantner]], who had been together since 1978, would go their separate ways, as Molitor left the Brewers for the Toronto Blue Jays, Gantner retired, and Yount would only last one more season before retiring in 1993.\n\nThe hope of additional pennant races was quickly dashed, as the club plummeted to the bottom of the standings in [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], finishing an abysmal 26 games out of first. Since 1992, highlights were few and far between as the franchise failed to produce a winning season, having not fielded a competitive team because of a combination of bad management and financial constraints that limit the team relative to the resources available to other, larger-market clubs.\n\nAs the 1990s came to a close, the Brewers were on their way to becoming a perennial doormat. A lack of good management and an aging ballpark in old County Stadium, were both becoming stark problems for the Brewers and many fans began to wonder if the Brewers would ever become contenders again.\n\n===1994\u20131998: Taking it National===\nIn 1994, Major League Baseball adopted a new, expanded playoff system. This change would necessitate a restructuring of each league from two divisions into three. The Brewers were transferred from the old AL East division to the newly created AL Central. (Due to the baseball strike, however, the new-look playoffs and [[1994 World Series|World Series]] did not materialize that year.)\n\nIn March 1995, two new franchises\u2014the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]\u2014were awarded by Major League Baseball, to begin play in 1998. It was decided to add one new team to each league. At the time, however, MLB did not want to have an odd number of teams per league because they would either have to give teams many more off-days than in the past, or [[interleague play]] would have to be extended year-round, or both (14 years later however, another realignment would ''cause'' there to be an odd number of teams in each league with year-round interleague play).  In order for MLB officials to continue the existing schedule, where teams play almost every day and where interleague play is limited to a few days per year, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams. The decision was made to have one existing club switch leagues.<ref>''See also'' [[Major League Baseball#League organization]].</ref>\n\nThis realignment was widely considered to have great financial benefit to the club moving.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Commissioner (then club owner) Bud Selig decided another team should have the first chance to switch leagues. The [[Kansas City Royals]] of the American League's Central Division were asked first, but they decided not to move over to the National League's Central Division.<ref name=BrewersSwitch>{{cite news|title=Brewers switch leagues, join Reds in NL Central|url=http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1997/brew110697.html|work=[[The Kentucky Post]] ([[Associated Press]])|publisher=[[E.

Had the Brewers elected not to move to the National League, the [[Minnesota Twins]] would have been offered the opportunity next.<ref>Pappas, Doug, [http://www.roadsidephotos.com/baseball/97-4news.htm \"News Briefs: Fall 1997\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727032139/http://www.roadsidephotos.com/baseball/97-4news.htm |date=2008-07-27 }}, ''Outside the Lines'', Fall 1997.</ref>\n\nMilwaukee had formerly been a National League town, having been the home of the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] for 13 seasons (1953\u201365) until their relocation to Atlanta. With the Brewers having joined the National League, it was now necessary for their pitchers to take batting practice, because the NL has a no DH rule.\n\nCoincidentally, the [[Houston Astros]], who were also in the NL Central at the time of the Brewers' league switch, would join the American League in 2013. That gave the two leagues the same number of teams (15), but necessitated expanded interleague play because of the odd number of teams that were present in each league.\n\n===1999\u20132003: Building Miller Park===\n[[File:Miller Park.jpg|thumbnail|right|270px|[[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], the current home of the Milwaukee Brewers.]]\nAs early as 1993, Brewers owner Bud Selig had talked of a new ballpark for the Brewers to replace [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], which had become heavily outdated and antiquated and didn't even have luxury suites.\n\nBy 1996, the club was set to build a new ballpark near the site of County Stadium, which would have a retractable roof to counter the unpredictable Wisconsin weather in the spring and autumn. It also helped to bring more fans and their families from all around Wisconsin to come to games with a practical guarantee of no rain-outs, bring in more potential revenue for the club.\n\n[[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] was opened in 2001, built to replace Milwaukee County Stadium. The stadium was built with $310 million of public funds, drawing some controversy, and is the only sporting facility to have a fan-shaped retractable roof. Miller Park has a [[seating capacity]] of seating 41,900 and with standing room 43,000, which is 10,000 fewer seats than County Stadium.\n\nThe park was to have opened a year earlier, but an accident during its construction, which resulted in the deaths of three workers, forced a year's delay and $50 million to $75 million in damage. On July 14, 1999, the three men lost their lives when the Lampson \"[[Big Blue (crane)|Big Blue]]\" crane, one of the largest in the world, collapsed while trying to lift a 400-ton right field roof panel. A statue commemorating the men now stands between the home plate entrance to Miller Park and [[Helfaer Field]].\n\nThe Brewers made renovations to Miller Park before the 2006 campaign, adding both [[LED]] scoreboards from [[Daktronics]], a company in [[Brookings, South Dakota]], in left field and on the second-tier of the stadium, as well as a picnic area in right field, shortening the distance of the right-field fence.<ref name=Daktronics>{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx |title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Milwaukee Brewers |access-date=2012-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030103803/http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=2012-10-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The picnic area was an immediate hit and sold out for the season before the year began.\n\nMiller Park also features another fan favorite, [[Sausage Race|The Racing Sausages]], in a race of five costumed mascots, held before the bottom of the sixth inning.\n\nWhile the Brewers' new park was a hit, the club itself was not successful playing in it, as the Brewers finished the season even worse than their previous seasons, going 68\u201394 in their first season at Miller Park. The Brewers finished 2002 even worse, finishing with a dismal 56\u2013106 record, 41 games out of first place, the worst record in franchise history.\n\nIn [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003]], the Brewers hired [[Doug Melvin]] as General Manager, who in turn brought in [[Ned Yost]], coach with the Atlanta Braves and a former member of the 1982 American League Champion Brewers, as manager. Though the Brewers only went 68\u201394 in 2003, the Brewers did raise hopes with a winning record in August during the season.\n\n===2004\u2013present: Attanasio era===\n\n====2004\u20132006: Building a winner====\nOn January 16, 2004, Selig announced that his ownership group was putting the team up for sale, to the great relief of many fans who were unhappy with the team's lackluster performance and poor management by his daughter, [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]], over the previous decade. In September 2004, the Brewers announced they had reached a verbal agreement with Los Angeles investment banker [[Mark Attanasio]] to purchase the team for a reported US$223 million. The sale to Attanasio was completed on January 13, 2005, at Major League Baseball's quarterly owners meeting. Other members of Attanasio's ownership group include [[private equity]] investor [[John Canning, Jr.]], David Uihlein, Harris Turer and Stephen Marcus, all of whom were involved with the previous ownership group led by Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2005/03/21/story1.html Attanasio seeks more local owners]. The Business Journal of Milwaukee, March 18, 2005</ref> Since taking over the franchise, Attanasio has worked hard to build bridges with Milwaukee baseball fans, including giving away every seat to the final home game of 2005 free of charge and bringing back the classic \"ball and glove\" logo of the club's glory days on \"Retro Friday\" home games, during which they also wear versions of the team's old pinstriped uniforms.\n\n=====2004=====\n{{main|2004 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nThe Brewers caused a stir in the first half of the 2004 season, when the team had a winning record in the first half of the season, even briefly being in 1st place in the NL Central. However, lack of a productive offense doomed the Brewers and the club sunk back to last place, finishing the season 67\u201394. The Brewers did have some bright moments during the season with pitcher [[Ben Sheets]] striking out 18 Atlanta Braves in one game and the Brewers coming back from a 9-run deficit to beat the [[2004 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].\n\nAfter the 2004 season, with Mark Attanasio now in control of the franchise, the Brewers were finally able to spend some money on free agents. The Brewers first significant free-agent signing in many years was veteran catcher [[Damian Miller]], a Wisconsin native, and to address a need for better run production, the Brewers traded speedy outfielder Scott Podsednik and relief pitcher Luis Vizca\u00edno to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Carlos Lee]]. The arrival of Lee gave Brewer fans even higher hopes that better seasons were on the way for the Brewers.\n[[File:Prince Rickie.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rickie Weeks and Prince Fielder at Spring training, 2005]]\n\n=====2005=====\n{{main|2005 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], under Attanasio's ownership, the team finished 81\u201381 to secure its first non-losing record since 1992. True to form, Carlos Lee provided the Brewers with much needed run support, hitting 32 home runs and driving in 112. Starting pitcher Chris Capuano also had a stellar season, going 18\u201312 with a 3.99 ERA, the most wins by a Brewer pitcher since Pete Vuckovich won 18 games in 1982.\n\nWith a solid base of young talent assembled over the past five years, including [[Prince Fielder]], [[Rickie Weeks]], [[J. J. Hardy]] and [[Corey Hart (baseball)|Corey Hart]], the Brewers showed renewed competitiveness. Further encouraging this sentiment, the Brewers had hired former stars Yount (bench coach; resigned in November 2006) and [[Dale Sveum]] (third base coach), both very popular players for the Brewers in the '80s.\n\n=====2006=====\n{{main|2006 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nIn [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], the Brewers' play disappointed fans, players, and management. They began the season 5\u20131 and had a 14\u201311 record at the end of April. On [[Mother's Day]] Bill Hall hit a walk off home run with his mother in the stands, a play that was shown on ESPN throughout the summer. However, soon starters JJ Hardy, Rickie Weeks, and Corey Koskie were lost to injuries, and the Brewers were forced to trade for veteran infielders [[David Bell (baseball)|David Bell]] and [[Tony Graffanino]]. They also suffered setbacks when losing starting pitchers [[Ben Sheets]] and [[Tomo Ohka]] for a substantial amount of time, forcing Triple A starters [[Ben Hendrickson]], [[Dana Eveland]], [[Carlos Villanueva (baseball)|Carlos Villanueva]], and [[Zach Jackson (pitcher, born 1983)|Zach Jackson]] into starting roles at different points in the year. Shortly before the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star]] break the Brewers climbed to one game above .500, but then lost their next three to the [[Chicago Cubs]] and would never return to .500. After the All Star break closer Derrick Turnbow blew four straight save opportunities. This led to the Brewers being far enough down in the standings that management decided to trade free agent-to-be [[Carlos Lee]] to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for closer [[Francisco Cordero]], outfielder [[Kevin Mench]], and two minor league prospects. Cordero replaced Turnbow as the Brewers closer and had immediate success, converting his first 13 save opportunities. On August 24 the Brewers completed a sweep of the [[2006 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] to climb to less than five games out in both the NL Central Division and NL Wild Card races, but then Milwaukee went on a 10-game losing streak that ended any postseason hope. The Brewers did rebound and play well in September including a four-game sweep of [[2006 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]], but it was too little too late. The Brewers ended the season with a 75\u201387 record.\n\nAt the end of the season, Attanasio stated that he and General Manager Doug Melvin would have to make some decisions about returning players for the 2007 season. With young players waiting in the minor leagues, during the off-season the key additions were starting pitcher and 2006 NLCS MVP [[Jeff Suppan]], starter [[Claudio Vargas]], reliever [[Greg Aquino]], catcher [[Johnny Estrada]], and returning Brewer [[Craig Counsell]]. The Brewers parted ways with 2006 starters [[Doug Davis (pitcher)|Doug Davis]] and Tomo Ohka, as well as fan favorite [[Jeff Cirillo]], who wanted more playing time with another team.\n\n====2007: The return to respectability====\n{{main|2007 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n[[File:Prince Fielder (929557698).jpg|thumb|upright|Prince Fielder]]\n[[File:Ben Sheets 2008-04-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ben Sheets]]\n\nBefore the 2007 season, the buzz surrounding the Brewers greatly increased. They were dubbed a \"sleeper team\" and \"contenders in the NL\" by numerous sports analysts and magazines. ESPN's Peter Gammons and Dan Patrick both picked The Brewers to beat out the defending champion [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] and re-vamped [[2007 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] to win the NL Central. To celebrate the successful 1982 Milwaukee Brewers team, the franchise decided to have the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] be named as the \"25th Anniversary of '82\", with more fan giveaways than any other Major League Baseball team except the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], and more discounts and deals than any other time in Brewers' history.\n\nESPN.com's lead story on August 29 stated: \".... Then there are the Brewers. The strange, impossible-to-figure-out Brewers. They once had the best record in the majors, were 14 games over .500 twice, and led the division by as many as 8\u00bd games on June 23. Since then, and there's no nice way of saying it; they've reeked.\".<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&id=2995727&sportCat=mlb\"Cubs sitting in the driver's seat]</ref> The Brewers cast this negativity to the side, and rebounded in September. Despite poor performances from the usually steady [[Chris Capuano]] and more nagging injuries to [[Ben Sheets]], the Brewers found themselves in a heated pennant race with Chicago's North Siders. The team's playoff drive took a hit late in the year, however, losing three of four games in a crucial series in Atlanta, dropping the Brewers to a season-high 3.5 games out of first. The Brewers won the first two games of their final homestand of the season to pull within two games of the Cubs, but faced a near impossible task with the club's elimination number down to only three and the wild card leading [[2007 San Diego Padres season|Padres]] coming to town. The club played well, but the Cubs clinched on the final Friday of the season. On September 29 the Brewers beat Padres 4\u20133 in extra innings to secure a winning season. The game was tied in the ninth inning by a triple by [[Tony Gwynn, Jr.]] in a highlight reel play that was repeated often during the 2007 post season. That win, and the win the next day, by the Brewers kept the Padres from advancing to the playoffs. The irony, of course, being that Gwynn's [[Tony Gwynn|father]] was arguably the most popular Padre of all-time, and Tony Gwynn, Jr. would later be traded to the Padres in 2009. Milwaukee finished at a respectable 83\u201379, only two games behind Chicago, the club's best finish since 1992.\nFirst baseman [[Prince Fielder]] made history in 2007, becoming the first Brewer and the youngest player ever to reach the 50 home run mark in a single season. For his effort, he finished third in the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player voting, garnering 284 total points including 5 first place votes. Fielder was also awarded the [[Hank Aaron Award]] for reaching the amazing single year record. Third baseman [[Ryan Braun]] was also rewarded for his historic season by being named 2007 NL Rookie of the Year.\n\n====2008: The return to the postseason====\n{{main|2008 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n[[File:DSC03365 Ryan Braun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ryan Braun]], 2008]]\n\nThe Brewers came into 2008 with hopes of ending the team's 26-year playoff drought, adding several veterans to the team in outfielder [[Mike Cameron]] and catcher [[Jason Kendall]], as well as relief pitchers \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 and [[Salom\u00f3n Torres]]. The Brewers started April on a solid winning note, but suffered two big blows in their pitching rotation when [[Dave Bush]] was demoted to AAA Nashville, and [[Yovani Gallardo]] suffered a potential season ending knee injury. The team dropped below .500 by the middle of May, capped off by a sweep from the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nThe Brewers rebounded in June as Salom\u00f3n Torres took over as closer, becoming a big success, and soon climbed back into contention. As June came to a close, the Brewers made their biggest move for playoff contention as they traded 4 prospects, most notably [[Matt LaPorta]], to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for [[CC Sabathia]]. General Manager Doug Melvin summed up the trade by saying, \"We are going for it.\" The Brewers came into the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]] with a 52\u201343 record, still third behind the Cubs and Cardinals. Ben Sheets was named starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star game, and Ryan Braun also started at left field. Corey Hart was named to the team in the Final Vote.\n\nThe Brewers came out of the All-Star break with a bang as they won their first seven games back, all of them on the road, sweeping first the Giants and then the Cardinals, taking over first place in the Wild Card standings. The Brewers came into the end of July still in the hunt for the division, but the front running Cubs swept the Brewers in a four-game set at Miller Park. While the Brewers were still holding on to the Wild Card lead, the division was never seriously challenged for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe Brewers came off the sweep from the Cubs with an amazing August, winning 20 of 28 games in the month. Sabathia made history by becoming the first pitcher in over 90 years to win his first 9 games after being traded mid-season. With a steady five game lead for the Wild Card, the hope of a playoff spot seemed secured, but the Brewers struggled in September, first getting swept by the [[2008 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], and then just over a week later, getting swept in four games by the [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], losing their lead in the Wild Card. Feeling a change was needed, the Brewers fired manager Ned Yost with just 12 games left in the season, replacing him with Brewers third base coach [[Dale Sveum]]. Sveum named Garth Iorg as his replacement as third base coach, and made [[Robin Yount]] the new bench coach, replacing [[Ted Simmons]]. With the final 6x games at home, the Brewers were still in the hunt for the Wild Card behind the New York Mets. They first swept the Pittsburgh Pirates, thanks to walk-off home runs by [[Prince Fielder]] and [[Ryan Braun]], tying the New York Mets for the Wild Card lead with 3 games to go against the NL Central division champion [[2008 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].\n\nThe Brewers took the first game thanks to a pinch-hit home run by [[Rickie Weeks]] and stellar relief pitching by [[Seth McClung]]. The Cubs took the second game, with the Wild Card race still in a dead tie. CC Sabathia was called to pitch his third game in a week, and was stellar, pitching a complete game, while Ryan Braun hit possibly the biggest home run in club history with a 2-run shot in the 8th inning to break a 1\u20131 tie. The Brewers won 3\u20131 while the New York Mets lost to the [[2008 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] 4\u20132, sealing the Brewers the Wild Card spot.\n\n=====2008 NLDS=====\n{{main|2008 National League Division Series}}\n\nThe Brewers finished the 2008 season one game ahead of the New York Mets in the wild card race with a final record of 90\u201372, and faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. This was the first time the Brewers reached the playoffs since 1982.\n\nThe Brewers played their first postseason game in 26 years on October 1. Pitcher [[Yovani Gallardo]] made his first postseason start and only his second start since coming off the disabled list in late September. The Brewers lost the first game of the NLDS 3\u20131 on a dominant performance by Phillies pitcher [[Cole Hamels]]. Hamels allowed only two hits and struck out nine Brewers batters in eight shutout innings. The Brewers mounted a comeback in the 9th inning as closer [[Brad Lidge]] allowed two hits, a walk, and a run to score. However, Brewers right fielder Corey Hart struck out with runners on second and third to end the game.\n\nThe Brewers hosted Game 3, which was the first playoff game ever hosted at Miller Park and the first in Milwaukee since Game 5 of the 1982 World Series. The Brewers won, but were eliminated in Game 4, ending the Brewers season while the Phillies went on to win the World Series.\n\n====2009: Missing playoffs====\n{{main|2009 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n\nDuring the off-season, the Brewers lost C.C. Sabathia when he filed for free agency and signed a lucrative deal with the [[New York Yankees]]. Despite the loss of a starting pitcher in Sabathia, the Brewers were able to sign all-time [[save (baseball)|save]] leader [[Trevor Hoffman]]. The Brewers were not able to build on their success from the year prior falling below .500 but were witness to Prince Fielder setting the all-time franchise record for RBI.\n\n====2010====\n{{main|2010 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\nThe Brewers attempted to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free agent [[Doug Davis (pitcher)|Doug Davis]], but the Brewers still struggled. After just one month, the Brewers released [[Jeff Suppan]], Doug Davis got injured, and Trevor Hoffman struggled to get saves. The only bright spots of the season was the Brewers' hitting. The Brewers were the only team in baseball to have three players with 100+ RBIs in Ryan Braun, Casey McGehee, and Corey Hart. The Brewers lost 9 games in a row in May and never fully recovered, finishing the season 77\u201385, which was good for 3rd place in the National League Central division, behind the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals. The only other bright spots of the season was Trevor Hoffman getting his 600th career save and the emergence of new closer [[John Axford]]. After the season, the Brewers chose not to renew the contract of manager Ken Macha. In October, just days after the World Series, the Brewers hired [[Ron Roenicke]], bench coach of the Los Angeles Angels, to be the Brewers' new manager.\n\n====2011 season: NL Central champs====\n{{Main|2011 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\n[[File:Shaun Marcum at Miller Park, Milwaukee, Wisconsin - 20110612.jpg|thumb|200px|Shaun Marcum, 2011]]\nWith the trades for [[Shaun Marcum]] and [[Zack Greinke]], the Brewers were tabbed by many experts as favorites to not only win the NL Central Division, but also contenders for the National League pennant. The Brewers did suffer some early losses in spring training, as Zack Greinke was lost to a rib injury that would keep him out for a month, and Corey Hart was out for the first half of April with a hamstring injury, which caused the Brewers to make a last-minute trade at the end of spring training for Washington Nationals outfielder Nyjer Morgan.\n\nThe Brewers struggled during the first month of the season, losing their first 4 games of the season and fell as far down as to 5th place in the NL Central Division, but the Brewers rebounded starting at the end of May and throughout June and early July. By the All-Star Break, the Brewers were in 2nd place in the division, behind Pittsburgh and St. Louis. To address some needed bullpen depth, the Brewers made a shocking trade just hours after the All-Star Game, trading two Class-A prospects to the New York Mets for ace reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who immediately became the Brewers set-up reliever for closer John Axford.\n\nThe Brewers went on a hot winning stretch through the month of August and by the beginning of September were 10 1/2 games ahead of St. Louis for the NL Central lead. Though the Brewers scuffled some in September, the Brewers clinched the division on September 26, beating the Florida Marlins 4\u20131. The Brewers finished the season with a 96\u201366 record, the best record in franchise history.\n\nAlong with their team accomplishments, the Brewers had many individual achievements from their players. Ryan Braun finished the season with 33 homers and 33 steals while finishing second in the National League in batting average, hitting .332 while Prince Fielder finished second in the league in both home runs and RBIs, hitting 38 home runs while driving in 120.\n\nThe Brewers starting pitching was also drastically better than 2010. Each of the Brewers 5 regular starters had 10-plus wins during the regular season. Yovani Gallardo won 17 games, the most by a Brewer since 2005, Zack Greinke won 16 games despite missing one month, both Shawn Marcum and Randy Wolf won 13 games, and number five starter Chris Narveson won 11 games. It was the first time since 1982 that the Brewers had five pitchers with 10 or more wins in a season. The Brewers also used fewer starting pitchers than any team in baseball, using only six starting pitchers, with [[Marco Estrada (baseball)|Marco Estrada]] filling in for 7 games when Greinke and later Narveson were out with injuries.\n\n====2011 Postseason====\nThe Brewers faced the NL West Champion Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS and won the first two games at Miller Park, with Yovani Gallardo pitching 8 stellar innings in a 4-1 Game 1 win. The Diamondbacks won games 3 and 4 in Arizona, setting up a deciding Game 5 back in Miller Park. The Brewers had a 2\u20131 lead going into the 9th inning when closer John Axford blew his first save since April, giving up the lead. The Brewers went on to win the game and the series in the 10th inning on a base hit by Nyjer Morgan driving in Carlos Gomez for the winning run. The Brewers faced their divisional foe and the NL Wild Card winner, the St. Louis Cardinals, who had upset the favored Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. Many Brewer fans{{Who|date=June 2012}} welcomed facing the Cardinals with the National League pennant at stake, with the Brewers and Cardinals having a growing rivalry, and also a chance for the Brewers to avenge their 1982 World Series defeat, which was at the hands of the Cardinals. The two teams split the first two games at Miller Park, then the Cardinals took two out of 3 games at Busch Stadium and won Game 6 to win the National League pennant and eventually the World Series against the Texas Rangers. Probably the biggest reason for the Brewers defeat{{According to whom|date=June 2012}} was the downfall of their starting pitching. In their 11 postseason games, the Brewers starting pitchers only had three quality starts, with Yovani Gallardo accounting for two of them, both of which were in the NLDS. The other quality start was Randy Wolf in Game 4 of the NLCS.\n\n====2012====\n{{Main|2012 Milwaukee Brewers season}}\nIn the offseason, the Brewers would lose many of their spot players that had helped them during the season, such as [[Mark Kotsay]], [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]], and [[Craig Counsell]] but their most notable loss was that of Prince Fielder, who would leave the team via free agency after having been a part of the Brewers organization for almost a decade. Fielder would end up signing with the Detroit Tigers. The Brewers would make two significant free agent signings during the off-season, signing shortstop Alex Gonzalez and third baseman Aramis Ramierez to improve the left side of the Brewers infield. The Brewers would also sign Japanese outfielder Norichika Aoki to bring some needed outfield depth.\n\nThe biggest news of all during the off-season, though, was the issue of the reigning NL MVP Ryan Braun apparently testing positive for PED's and facing a possible 50-game suspension. Braun would appeal the suspension and won on the basis that the test was not processed properly, making him the first player to win an appeal against a suspension regarding illegal substances.\n\nDespite the offseason losses and controversies, the Brewers fans still looked forward to the 2012 season with great optimism, as the Brewers, by the end of February, had sold over 1.5 million tickets, the most before the month of March. However, the Brewers started the season poorly, with a 40\u201345 record by the All-Star break.<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=320708118&teams=milwaukee-brewers-vs-houston-astros</ref> Poor bullpen play put the team even further out of contention by the end of July, which caused the Brewers to trade ace pitcher [[Zack Greinke]] to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in exchange for top minor league shortstop Jean Segura and two minor league relief pitchers.\n\nSuddenly, in mid-August, the Brewers went on a run to put themselves back in postseason contention. The bullpen started to turn itself around and the team was able to get production from several minor league call-ups, like [[Mike Fiers]], [[Martin Maldonado]], [[Jeff Bianchi]], and [[Wily Peralta]]. Combined with stellar hitting of [[Ryan Braun]], [[Aramis Ram\u00edrez]], [[Corey Hart (baseball)|Corey Hart]], and [[Jonathan Lucroy]], the Brewers, from August 16 to September 23, won 26 of 35 games. However, the Brewers were eliminated from postseason contention on September 30, a 7\u20130 loss to the [[Houston Astros]].\n\nThe Brewers still finished with a winning record in 2012, going 83\u201379, finishing in 3rd place in the NL Central behind Cincinnati and St. Louis.\n\n====2013====\nThe Brewers hoped to become contenders again in 2013, and tried to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free-agent [[Kyle Lohse]], but the Brewers, after starting off well with a 14\u201311 record in April, fell flat with a 6\u201322 mark in May, and never regained momentum, finishing the season 74\u201388.\n\nFurther compounding the Brewers' fall during the season were nagging injuries to Aramis Ram\u00edrez, and also Ryan Braun's supposed involvement with the Biogensis scandal, which resulted in Braun being suspended for the final 60 games of the regular season after he admitted to taking PEDs during the 2011 playoffs. Major League Baseball didn't force Braun to surrender his 2011 National League MVP award.\n\nOn the field, the Brewers did have several individual performances that gave fans some hope for the coming seasons. Shortstop Jean Segura finished second in the National League with 44 stolen bases, and Carlos Gomez had a breakout season, batting .284 with 24 home runs, 40 stolen bases, and became the first Brewer since 1982 to win a Gold Glove award for his defensive play, and catcher Jonathan Lucroy had a stellar offensive season, hitting 18 home runs and driving in 82 RBIs.\n\n====2014====\nFew experts considered the Brewers as contenders in the NL Central for 2014, even after the Brewers signed another free-agent starting pitcher in [[Matt Garza]]; most expected the Brewers to finish no better than 4th in the division. The team also improved their bullpen with resigning Francisco Rodriguez as closer, trading outfielder Nori Aoki to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for a young pitcher in Will Smith, and signing veteran slugging first baseman Mark Reynolds.\n\nThe Brewers started the season hot, going 20\u20137 in April, much to the surprise of many. The Brewers have showed much improved starting pitching, with a steady rotation in Yovani Gallardo, Kyle Lohse, Matt Garza, Wily Peralta, and Marco Estrada. In addition, Francisco Rodriguez regained his old form, successfully closing out his first 17 saves of the season, and Will Smith became virtually untouchable, sporting a 0.88 ERA in the first two months of the season.\n\nThough the Brewers showed some struggles in the months of May and July, the team continued to stay on top of the standings as one of the better teams in the National League, helped by an 18\u201310 record in June. By mid September, however, they had lost their division lead to the St. Louis Cardinals and were trailing behind the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card race.\n\nThe Brewers were in first place in the division from April 5 to September 1, but ultimately finished third in the division after a sub-.500 September, barely getting over .500 with an 82\u201380 record.<ref>http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/epic-collapse-forces-hard-look-everywhere-b99363945z1-278142131.html</ref>\n\nA couple of standout performers for the Brewers came from Jonathon Lucroy, who finished with a .301 batting average and led the National League with 53 doubles and set a new Major League record for doubles by a catcher in a season with 48. Second-year pitcher Wily Peralta had a 17\u201311 record, while Kyle Lohse had a 13\u20139 record with 2 complete game shutouts.\n\n====2015====\nThe offseason for the Brewers was relatively quiet, with only a couple of trades made where the Brewers parted with two starting pitchers. [[Marco Estrada (baseball)|Marco Estrada]] was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for first baseman [[Adam Lind]],<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11802384/toronto-blue-jays-trade-adam-lind-milwaukee-brewers-marco-estrada</ref> and [[Yovani Gallardo]], after 8 seasons with the Brewers and becoming the franchise's all-time strikeout leader, was traded to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/01/19/rangers-acquire-yovani-gallardo-in-trade/21932721/</ref> During the offseason, [[Ryan Braun]], who had his worst season ever during 2014 (.266 avg., 19 HR, and 81 RBI's), had surgery on his right thumb,<ref>http://www.brewcrewball.com/2014/10/2/6894993/ryan-braun-surgery-thumb-brewers-cryotherapy</ref> which had bothered him all during the season and was thought to be the reason behind his dismal numbers. On the field, the Brewers' season went south almost immediately, going 5\u201317 in the month of April. On May 4, manager Ron Roenicke was fired and Craig Counsell was named interim manager, staying manager for the Brewers through the rest of the season, as the team finished 68\u201394.\n\n====2016: Rebuilding====\nThe Brewers began a mode of rebuilding the team, with Doug Melvin stepping down as general manager and being replaced with Houston Astros assistant GM, [[David Stearns]]. Stearns kept interim manager [[Craig Counsell]], making him the Brewers full-time manager, and traded away over half of the Brewers' 40-man roster from 2015 before the 2016 season came to a close. The Brewers finished the 2016 season with a 73\u201389 record, but had a 41\u201340 record at home, and had two players lead the National League in major offensive categories, with infielder [[Jonathan Villar]] leading the NL, and all of Major League Baseball, with 62 stolen bases, and first baseman Chris Carter tied for the NL lead in home runs, with 41. Ryan Braun also had a rebound season, with a .305 batting average, 30 home runs, 91 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases. The Brewers also traded away many franchise stars in exchange for prospects, such as Jonathan Lucroy and Carlos Gomez, and other starters, with the exception of Ryan Braun.\n\n====2017====\nThe Brewers came into 2017 with minimal expectations other than continuing their rebuilding of the team. The team surprised many by finishing the month of April at .500, with encouraging performances from Eric Thames, Chase Anderson, Jesus Aguilar, and Travis Shaw. The Brewers continued to stay around .500 for the next two months, and took advantage of the struggles of the Cubs and Cardinals, and started July with a hot 7\u20132 start, putting the Brewers at 50-41 for the season, 5.5 games ahead of the Cubs in the NL Central at the All-Star break. The Brewers struggled after the All-Star break, going 3-11 for the rest of July, followed by a 6-game losing streak in the middle of August. The Brewers still stayed in the race for the Wild Card game, but fell short of the postseason and the NL Central Division, with an 86\u201376 record, which still was a surprise for many in the baseball community.\n\n====2018====\nWith the opportunity to build off their surprising 2017 run, Brewers GM David Stearns worked on stocking up the Brewers roster for 2018, including signing pitchers Jhoulys Chacin and Junior Guerra, and outfielder Lorenzo Cain, who had originally started his MLB career in Milwaukee. The Brewers also traded for another outfielder, Christian Yelich, for four minor leaguers. The Brewers started 2018 well, helped by a stretch in May where they went 19\u20138 to put themselves on top in the NL Central division, taking advantage, once again, of early struggles for both the Cubs and Cardinals. However, the team struggled again in the middle of the season, going 40-39 through the months of June, July, and August. However, they were still in the playoff hunt, leading in the Wild Card, but were still 5 games behind the division-leading Cubs going into the final month of the season. The Brewers got hot again, going 19\u20137 in September, including winning 10 of their last 11 games, the last 8 in a row, to catch the Cubs. Christian Yelich led the offense, going on an offensive tear, including hitting clutch home runs in two of the final three games of the season against the Detroit Tigers. The Brewers tied the Cubs for the NL Central lead, resulting in a one-game playoff for the division title. The Brewers won 3\u20131, clinching their second division title of the decade, and only their 3rd in franchise history, finishing with a 96\u201367 record, tying the franchise record for wins in a season. The Brewers continued their hot run in the NLDS, against the Colorado Rockies, sweeping them in three games to advance to the NLCS, also achieving at least 12 wins in a row for only the second time in their history. The Brewers faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, but the Brewers were unable to keep their late momentum, as the Dodgers bullpen was able to quiet the Brewers' bats, winning the National League pennant in seven games.\n\n====2019====\nFollowing their amazing 2018 campaign, GM David Stearns worked more on adding more talent to the Brewers roster, including signing free agent catcher [[Yasmani Grandal]] and third baseman [[Mike Moustakas]], each on one year contracts. The Brewers headed into the month of September with an overall record of 69\u201366, being four games behind the Cubs for the second wild card spot and trailing the Cardinals by six and a half games for the division lead. On September 25, the Brewers beat the Cincinnati Reds 9\u20132 to clinch a postseason spot for the sixth time in franchise history, knocking the Cubs out of playoff contention. It was also the first time the Brewers had made the postseason for a consecutive season since 1982. But in their final three regular season games, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies at [[Coors Field]], which lead to the Brewers finishing 20\u20137 in September, 89-73 for the regular season, and finishing two games behind the NL Central Champion Cardinals. They ended up taking the second spot in the wild card. Therefore, the Brewers faced the eventual World Champion Washington Nationals in the NL wild card game in Washington D.C., where they lost 4\u20133.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Peter Filichia, ''Professional Baseball Franchises'', Facts on File Press, 1993.\n*Philip J.

The show was based on the [[board game]] [[Scattergories|of the same name]] and featured a panel of five celebrities. However, the difference was that instead of being live in studio, each celebrity's participation was videotaped in advance; the celebrities also recorded introductions for Clark and dialogues leading into and out of commercial breaks.\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe team in control was given 15 seconds to name up to six items that fit a particular category and started with a specific letter of the alphabet. The team scored a point each time the team gave an acceptable word. However, no player could give two consecutive answers, and no word could be used as part of more than two answers.\n\nAfter the list was complete or time ran out, the other team could challenge any word they believed to be unacceptable. If challenged, a panel of five jurors voted whether or not the word was acceptable, with the majority vote ruling. If the word was unacceptable, the controlling team lost a point; otherwise the controlling team received an additional point.\n\nOriginally, Clark read the category and then the letter in play for the round and members of each team attempted to buzz-in and provide a word that fit both criteria. The team who won the toss-up scored a point and played the remainder of that half of the round. This was later changed to having the challengers play the first category and letter.\n\nOnce the first part of their round was done, the team in control was given a chance to earn up to four additional points with the celebrity panel. One at a time the team chose a member of the panel and that celebrity's response was played back to the team. If the celebrity gave an answer that was not on the team's list, they received one point. If the team chose a celebrity that gave an answer matching any of the team's answers, a point was taken away.\n\nIn the second round, the above point values were doubled and whoever was ahead at the end of the round won the game and $500.\n\nIf both teams were tied at the end of round two, a toss-up similar to the one used to determine control at the beginning of the episode was played. The first team member to buzz-in and give an answer ruled valid by the judges won the game for their team.\n\n==Bonus round==\nFor the bonus game, one final category was played. This time, each of the five celebrities was assigned a random letter and had to give an answer that started with their letter.\n\nAfter the winning team was given the category, going in order from left to right they had to give two answers for each celebrity and both answers had to start with the celebrity's assigned letter. The team was given twenty-five seconds to do this.\n\nAfter the time expired, the judges went over the team's words and if any words were disallowed, the celebrity attached to those words was taken out of play. Celebrities were also taken out of play if the team failed to come up with the necessary two words.\n\nOnce the judges were done, the team was shown each of the celebrities' responses that they had unlocked. If a celebrity gave an answer that was not one of the two given by the team, they captured that celebrity. If the team managed to capture three celebrities, they won a cash jackpot that started at $4,000 and increased by $1,000 each day it went unclaimed.  If they were unsuccessful, they earned $100 for each celebrity that they unlocked.\n\nOriginally, the winning team picked one of five cards, each containing the name of a different celebrity. The team won the jackpot if they had captured the celebrity whose name was on the card, or all five celebrities were captured. If they were unsuccessful, they won $200 for each captured celebrity.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Scattergories'' and a revival of Grundy's earlier hit ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]'' joined the NBC lineup on the same day. NBC was looking to replace the soap opera ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', which had been airing since 1984 but had recently suffered a dive in ratings thanks in part to stations becoming more prone to moving their schedules around to open the 3:00 pm slot ''Santa Barbara'' occupied for other programming such as talk shows. NBC agreed to give that time slot back to the affiliates once ''Santa Barbara'' ended; NBC was the first of the major American broadcast networks to do this; ABC gave the slot back in 2012, while CBS affiliates and some ABC affiliates are allowed flexibility as to where they choose to air programming.\n\nIn exchange, NBC reclaimed the noon hour as a network time slot and chose to place both of its new game shows there. ''Scattergories'' aired at 12:30 pm, following ''Scrabble'', for its entire run. However, many affiliates of the three major networks had for years chosen to preempt any network programming that they aired in the noon hour, instead airing local newscasts or syndicated programming. ''Scattergories'' was no exception, as not all of NBC's affiliates cleared the show. In markets that did, the series was up against ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' on ABC and the top-rated ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on CBS and did not perform well against either soap opera.\n\nNBC decided to end ''Scattergories'' after twenty weeks; the show's last episode aired on June 11, 1993. It was replaced by ''[[Caesars Challenge]]'', which aired until January 14, 1994.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0180980|Scattergories}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scattergories (Game Show)}}\n[[Category:1993 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1993 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s American game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on board games]]\n[[Category:Television series by Reg Grundy Productions]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n[[Category:Television shows based on Hasbro toys]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Scattergories\n| genre                = [[Game show]]\n| presenter            = [[Dick Clark]]\n| narrated             = [[Charlie Tuna]]\n| country              = United States\n| company              = [[Reg Grundy Productions]]\n| distributor          = [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]]\n| language             = English\n| num_episodes         = 105\n| runtime              = 25 minutes\n| channel              = [[NBC]]\n| first_aired          = {{start date|1993|01|18}}\n| last_aired           = {{end date|1993|06|11}}\n}}\n\n'''''Scattergories''''' is an American game show on [[NBC|NBC daytime]] hosted by [[Dick Clark]], with [[Charlie Tuna]] as announcer, that aired from January 18 to June 11, 1993.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/376/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|page=377}}</ref> The show, which was adapted from the [[Parker Brothers]] [[board game]] [[Scattergories|of the same name]], was produced by [[Reg Grundy Productions]] and was the second to last American game show to be produced by the company.\n\n==Main game==\nTwo teams of four players competed in a battle of the sexes manner (four men vs. four women).

It was the second single to be released from the band's third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]''.\n\nThe song peaked at number two in the UK charts in September 1997, being kept from the top spot by the record-breaking [[Elton John]] single \"[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]\", which was re-recorded and released in memory of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], who had died three weeks before the release of \"Stand by Me\". Despite this, \"Stand by Me\" still went gold in the UK, and would eventually reach platinum status in 2019. It ended up at number 46 on the end of year charts in the United Kingdom for 1997. The song also reached number two in Ireland and reached the top 10 in Finland, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden.\n\n==History==\nNoel Gallagher claims to have written the song whilst suffering from food poisoning when he first moved to London. His mother Peggy would phone him to check on him and repeatedly told him to ensure he was eating properly. This spurred Gallagher to cook himself a proper British Sunday dinner, which resulted in a bout of food poisoning. In a 1997 interview promoting ''Be Here Now'', Noel Gallagher had the following to say: \"It starts, 'Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday'. When I first moved to London me mam kept on ringing up and asking was I eating properly. Yes, Mam. So I tried to cook a [[Sunday roast]] and puked up for two days with food poisoning. It was back to [[Pot Noodle]]s after that.\"<ref name=\"special\">Noel Gallagher; {{YouTube|igEJsHmhV9k|Oasis: Be Here Now Special}}; hosted by [[Molly Meldrum]]; 1997</ref>\n\nThe title for the song likely comes from the [[Ben E. King]] song \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", which was covered by the Gallaghers' idol [[John Lennon]]. In a characteristic example of Noel Gallagher lifting elements from songs of which he is fond, the rousing sequence of [[Chord progression|chord changes]] between the repeated chorus lyrics 'Stand by me/Nobody knows the way it's gonna be' bears a remarkable similarity to a similar chord sequence in [[Mott The Hoople]]'s \"[[All the Young Dudes (song)|All the Young Dudes]]\", acknowledged by Gallagher: \"It's a bit like \"Live Forever\", I suppose, with a touch of \"All the Young Dudes\" in the background\u2014though I made sure I changed the chords.\"<ref name=\"special\" />\n\n==Live performances==\nDue to Noel Gallagher's general dislike of ''Be Here Now'', \"Stand by Me\" was rarely played live by the band at their concerts after the Be Here Now Tour, as it was Noel who usually decided the set lists for Oasis' tours. A live version of the song from this tour can be found on the double-CD version of ''[[Familiar to Millions]]''.\n\nA well-known acoustic version of \"Stand by Me\" was shown on television the night before the release of ''Be Here Now'' as part of a [[BBC One]] documentary, featuring Noel, [[Liam Gallagher]] and drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] sitting by the side of a swimming pool, with Liam on vocals, Noel on acoustic guitar and White playing [[tambourine]]. This version became available with the 2016 \"Chasing The Sun\" edition of ''Be Here Now''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the song was shot on 20 September 1997. It was a reworking of a famous series of adverts for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. Entitled 'The Whole Picture', the adverts showed people appearing to be engaging in criminal and/or anti-social acts\u2014only for it to be revealed that they are actually helping someone else.

It was the second single to be released from the band's third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]''.\n\nThe song peaked at number two in the UK charts in September 1997, being kept from the top spot by the record-breaking [[Elton John]] single \"[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]\", which was re-recorded and released in memory of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], who had died three weeks before the release of \"Stand by Me\". Despite this, \"Stand by Me\" still went gold in the UK, and would eventually reach platinum status in 2019. It ended up at number 46 on the end of year charts in the United Kingdom for 1997. The song also reached number two in Ireland and reached the top 10 in Finland, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden.\n\n==History==\nNoel Gallagher claims to have written the song whilst suffering from food poisoning when he first moved to London. His mother Peggy would phone him to check on him and repeatedly told him to ensure he was eating properly. This spurred Gallagher to cook himself a proper British Sunday dinner, which resulted in a bout of food poisoning. In a 1997 interview promoting ''Be Here Now'', Noel Gallagher had the following to say: \"It starts, 'Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday'. When I first moved to London me mam kept on ringing up and asking was I eating properly. Yes, Mam. So I tried to cook a [[Sunday roast]] and puked up for two days with food poisoning. It was back to [[Pot Noodle]]s after that.\"<ref name=\"special\">Noel Gallagher; {{YouTube|igEJsHmhV9k|Oasis: Be Here Now Special}}; hosted by [[Molly Meldrum]]; 1997</ref>\n\nThe title for the song likely comes from the [[Ben E. King]] song \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", which was covered by the Gallaghers' idol [[John Lennon]]. In a characteristic example of Noel Gallagher lifting elements from songs of which he is fond, the rousing sequence of [[Chord progression|chord changes]] between the repeated chorus lyrics 'Stand by me/Nobody knows the way it's gonna be' bears a remarkable similarity to a similar chord sequence in [[Mott The Hoople]]'s \"[[All the Young Dudes (song)|All the Young Dudes]]\", acknowledged by Gallagher: \"It's a bit like \"Live Forever\", I suppose, with a touch of \"All the Young Dudes\" in the background\u2014though I made sure I changed the chords.\"<ref name=\"special\" />\n\n==Live performances==\nDue to Noel Gallagher's general dislike of ''Be Here Now'', \"Stand by Me\" was rarely played live by the band at their concerts after the Be Here Now Tour, as it was Noel who usually decided the set lists for Oasis' tours. A live version of the song from this tour can be found on the double-CD version of ''[[Familiar to Millions]]''.\n\nA well-known acoustic version of \"Stand by Me\" was shown on television the night before the release of ''Be Here Now'' as part of a [[BBC One]] documentary, featuring Noel, [[Liam Gallagher]] and drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] sitting by the side of a swimming pool, with Liam on vocals, Noel on acoustic guitar and White playing [[tambourine]]. This version became available with the 2016 \"Chasing The Sun\" edition of Be Here Now.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the song was shot on 20 September 1997. It was a reworking of a famous series of adverts for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. Entitled 'The Whole Picture', the adverts showed people appearing to be engaging in criminal and/or anti-social acts\u2014only for it to be revealed that they are actually helping someone else. For example, a scruffily-dressed [[skinhead]] rushes at a businessman; it appears he is making an effort to [[mug]] him and break into his car, when he is actually getting it open for the businessman who locked the key inside it. Similarly, the music video shows a shop appearing to be being burgled \u2014 its window is smashed and people are taking away electrical goods \u2014 only for it to be revealed that in fact the victim of a motorcycle crash has gone through the window and is buried under the goods. At the same time, a man who was earlier shown to be apparently running away from approaching police officers was actually rushing to save a girl from being run over by the motorcycle \u2014 the officers just happened to come by at that time.<ref>{{cite web |date=2009-07-05 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9kdHXrJYF8 |title=Oasis- Stand by me (original and official) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2009-07-05}}</ref> The video was filmed in the suburban town of [[Feltham]], in [[west London]].\n\n==Track listing==\n'''CD (Promo)''' <small>SAMPCS 4621</small> \n#\"Stand by Me\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:51\n\n'''CD''' <small>CRESCD 278</small>\n#\"Stand by Me\" \u2013 5:55\n#\"(I Got) The Fever\" \u2013 5:14\n#\"My Sister Lover\" \u2013 5:58\n#\"Going Nowhere\" \u2013 4:41\n\n'''7\"''' <small>CRE 278</small> / Cassette <small>CRECS 278</small> / CD (Promo) <small>CCD 278X</small>\n#\"Stand by Me\" \u2013 5:55\n#\"(I Got) The Fever\" \u2013 5:14\n\n'''12\"''' <small>CRE 278T</small>\n#\"Stand by Me\" \u2013 5:55\n#\"(I Got) The Fever\" \u2013 5:14\n#\"My Sister Lover\" \u2013 5:58\n\n* \"My Sister Lover\" - Some fans believe the title to be a reference to the band Sister Lovers, a group that invited Oasis to a May 1993 gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], where they were spotted by [[Creation Records]] chief [[Alan McGee]], who reportedly offered Oasis a recording contract on the spot after the gig.\n* \"Going Nowhere\" - apparently Noel's attempt at a [[Burt Bacharach]] style song - can be found on ''[[The Masterplan (Oasis album)|The Masterplan]]'', a collection of Oasis B-sides.

It is generally considered the midpoint between the cities of [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of both cities, approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], less than {{convert|19|mi|km}} from [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the [[Carquinez Bridge]], and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from the [[Benicia Bridge]]. Fairfield was founded in 1856 by [[clipper]]ship [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|captain Robert H. Waterman]], and named after his former hometown of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].\n\nIt is the home of [[Travis Air Force Base]] and the headquarters of [[Jelly Belly]].  With a population of 108,321 at the 2010 census, it is slightly smaller in population than [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Other nearby cities include [[Suisun City, California|Suisun City]], [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]], [[Rio Vista, California|Rio Vista]], [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], and [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|34.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 5.65% water.\n\nThe city is located within the California Coastal Ranges. The city is centered directly north of the [[Suisun Bay]] and northeast of the [[San Pablo Bay]]. Much of the Suisun Bay contains the [[Suisun Marsh]], the largest saltwater marsh on the west coast of the United States.\n\nThe city includes one hospital '''NorthBay Medical Center''', a 154-bed advanced medical facility that also features a level II Trauma Center.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the City of Fairfield website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |title=About Fairfield |access-date=January 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230074905/http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Native Americans, such as those from the Ion culture, settled in the Rockville and Green Valley areas. Artifacts that have been found from some of the earliest human inhabitants of the Fairfield area are dated to be around five to six thousand years old, making them some of the oldest Native American settlements in Northern California. \n \nThe first European contact came in 1810 when the Spanish army was ordered to attack the [[Suisunes|Suisun Indians]]. In 1835 the Mexican [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo|General Vallejo]] was so magnanimous in victory over the Indian Chief Sem Yeto that the chief later became his ally in conflicts against other tribes. In 1837 the [[Chief Solano|Indian Chief Solano]] received the [[Rancho Suisun]] Mexican land grant. This grant eventually came into the hands of a clipper ship captain from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] named [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|Robert H. Waterman]]. He not only parceled out the town in 1856, but also, in a commercially shrewd move, entered Fairfield in the race for Solano County seat in 1858, and won it from [[Benicia, California|Benicia]]. As an inducement he granted {{convert|16|acre|ha}} of land for the construction of county buildings. In 1903 Fairfield was incorporated as a city.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 329\n|1880= 424\n|1910= 834\n|1920= 1008\n|1930= 1131\n|1940= 1312\n|1950= 3118\n|1960= 14968\n|1970= 44146\n|1980= 58099\n|1990= 77211\n|2000= 96178\n|2010= 105321\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=116884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=April 26, 2015|df=mdy}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0623182|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Fairfield city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Fairfield had a population of 105,322.

It is generally considered the midpoint between the cities of [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of both cities, approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the city center of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], less than {{convert|19|mi|km}} from [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the [[Carquinez Bridge]], and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from the [[Benicia Bridge]]. Fairfield was founded in 1856 by [[clipper]]ship [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|captain Robert H. Waterman]], and named after his former hometown of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].\n\nIt is the home of [[Travis Air Force Base]] and the headquarters of [[Jelly Belly]].  With a population of 108,321 at the 2010 census, it is slightly smaller in population than [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Other nearby cities include [[Suisun City, California|Suisun City]], [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]], [[Rio Vista, California|Rio Vista]], [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], and [[Napa, California|Napa]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|34.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is water. The total area is 5.65% water.\n\nThe city is located within the California Coastal Ranges. The city is centered directly north of the [[Suisun Bay]] and northeast of the [[San Pablo Bay]]. Much of the Suisun Bay contains the [[Suisun Marsh]], the largest saltwater marsh on the west coast of the United States.\n\nThe city includes one hospital '''NorthBay Medical Center''', a 154-bed advanced medical facility that also features a level II Trauma Center.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the City of Fairfield website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |title=About Fairfield |access-date=January 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230074905/http://www.ci.fairfield.ca.us/about/history/default.asp |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Native Americans, such as those from the Ion culture, settled in the Rockville and Green Valley areas. Artifacts that have been found from some of the earliest human inhabitants of the Fairfield area are dated to be around five to six thousand years old, making them some of the oldest Native American settlements in Northern California. \n \nThe first European contact came in 1810 when the Spanish army was ordered to attack the [[Suisunes|Suisun Indians]]. In 1835 the Mexican [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo|General Vallejo]] was so magnanimous in victory over the Indian Chief Sem Yeto that the chief later became his ally in conflicts against other tribes. In 1837 the [[Chief Solano|Indian Chief Solano]] received the [[Rancho Suisun]] Mexican land grant. This grant eventually came into the hands of a clipper ship captain from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] named [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|Robert H. Waterman]]. He not only parceled out the town in 1856, but also, in a commercially shrewd move, entered Fairfield in the race for Solano County seat in 1858, and won it from [[Benicia, California|Benicia]]. As an inducement he granted {{convert|16|acre|ha}} of land for the construction of county buildings. In 1903 Fairfield was incorporated as a city.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 329\n|1880= 424\n|1910= 834\n|1920= 1008\n|1930= 1131\n|1940= 1312\n|1950= 3118\n|1960= 14968\n|1970= 44146\n|1980= 58099\n|1990= 77211\n|2000= 96178\n|2010= 105321\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=116884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=April 26, 2015|df=mdy}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0623182|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Fairfield city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Fairfield had a population of 105,322.

Considered an outstanding preacher as well as a strong polemical writer defending [[Anglicanism]], Stillingfleet was known as \"the beauty of holiness\" for his good looks in the pulpit,<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Sermon|volume=24|page=674}}</ref> and was called by [[John Hough (bishop)|John Hough]] \"the ablest man of his time\".<ref>[[David C. Douglas]], ''English Scholars'' (1939), p. 254.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHe was born in [[Cranborne]], [[Dorset]]. He went at the age of thirteen to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1652.<ref>{{acad|id=STLT648E|name=Stillingfleet, Edward}}</ref> He became vicar of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]] in 1657.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\">{{cite EB1911 |date=1911b|wstitle=Stillingfleet, Edward |volume=25 |page=921}}</ref>\n\nIn 1665, after he had made his name as a writer, he became vicar at [[St Andrew, Holborn]].  He preached at [[St Margaret, Westminster]] on 10 October 1666, the 'day of humiliation and fasting' after the [[Great Fire of London]], with such an attendance that there was standing room only. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded that he could not get in to hear the sermon, eating a meal of herrings in a pub instead.<ref>Adrian Tinniswood, ''By Permission of Heaven: The Story of the Great Fire of London'' (2003), p. 181.</ref>\n\nHe then held many [[preferment]]s, including a [[chaplain|Royal Chaplaincy]], and the [[Dean of St Paul's|Deanery of St Paul's]] (1678), the latter involving him in work connected with the building of the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He became [[Bishop of Worcester]] in 1689. He was a frequent speaker in the [[House of Lords]], and had considerable influence as a churchman.\n\nHe supported [[Richard Bentley]], who lived in his household as a tutor for a number of years, from shortly after his graduation in 1693. Bentley would later be his chaplain and biographer, and describe him as \"one of the most universal scholars that ever lived\".<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bentley, Richard (scholar) |display=Bentley, Richard |volume=3 |page=750}}</ref><ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45118 british-history.ac.uk</ref>\n\nIn 1691, at his request, [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] wrote to the magistrates of [[Middlesex]], asking for stronger enforcement of the laws against [[vice]]. This was an early move in the campaign of the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]].<ref>Deborah Payne Fisk, ''The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre'' (20000, p. 212.</ref>\n\nAt his death Stillingfleet left a library of some 10,000 printed books, which were purchased by [[Narcissus Marsh]] and today are part of [[Marsh's Library]] in Dublin, Ireland. His manuscript collection was purchased by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (1661\u20131724), and passed with the Harleian Manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 as one of the foundation collections.\n\n==Patronage, politics and views==\nStillingfleet had to wait many years for a bishopric, a fact linked to his disfavour at Court in the 1680s. He never, though, lacked for well-connected patrons. The first was [[Sir Roger Burgoyne, 2nd Baronet]], a barrister and MP in the [[Long Parliament]], in whose gift was [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]], his living; followed by Francis Pierrepont, a Parliamentarian colonel and younger brother of [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester]] (a Royalist) and [[William Pierrepont (politician)|William Pierrepont]] (like Francis a Parliamentarian). These both offered him tutoring positions. He was also supported by [[Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet|Harbottle Grimstone]], who as [[Master of the Rolls]] gave him a preaching position in the [[Rolls Chapel]].<ref>John Trevor Cliffe, ''The Puritan Gentry Besieged, 1650-1700'' (1993), p. 40.</ref>\n\nThe transition at the Restoration was certainly problematic. [[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]] presented Stillingfleet to St Andrew, Holborn. [[Humphrey Henchman]], [[Bishop of London]], employed him to write a vindication of [[William Laud]]'s answer to [[John Percy]] (''alias'' Fisher).<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\"/> According to Jon Parkin,\n\n{{cquote|The apparent ease with which younger writers like Stillingfleet squared their allegiance to the restored regime, coupled with their espousal of a naturalistic, [[erastian]] and apparently [[Hobbesian]] [[ecclesiology]], earned them the description of 'men of latitude'.}}\n\nStillingfleet was a leader within the Church of England of the \"[[latitudinarian]]s\", the group of Anglicans thus defined pejoratively. Latitudinarism as doctrine was considered to have grown from the teaching of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], but in practical terms conditions at the Restoration did not favour it. Quite a number of its Cambridge adherents left an unpromising career in religion for the law, or had to rely for patronage on those who had done so.<ref>Parkin, p. 27.</ref>\n\nStillingfleet was most closely associated, in his attitudes, with such as [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Isaac Barrow]], [[Robert South]] and [[John Tillotson]]. They agreed, for example, on a literal interpretation to Biblical [[exegesis]], discarding [[allegorical]] readings.<ref>B. W. Young, ''Religion and Enlightenment in Eighteenth-Century England: Theological Debate from Locke to Burke'' (1998), p. 190.</ref> With Tillotson he favoured the so-called Erastian view, that the ruler had great powers over the Church, from the days of 1660; after the [[Glorious Revolution]] they became [[Low Church]] moderates.<ref>Tony Claydon, ''Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760'' (2007), p. 330.</ref> With [[Gilbert Burnet]], [[Benjamin Hoadly]], [[Simon Patrick]], [[William Powell (clergyman)|William Powell]] and [[William Whiston]], he held some [[High Church]] views also.<ref>William Gibson, ''Altitudinarian Equivocation: George Smalridge's Churchmanship'', p. 57 in William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram (editors), ''Religious Identities in Britain, 1660-1832'' (2005).</ref>\n\nWith [[Thomas Tenison]], Stillingfleet and Tillotson preached on behalf of reason and [[natural religion]]. They are described as influential [[Arminianism|Arminian]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].{{sfn|Coffey|2006|p=227|ps=.

He preached at [[St Margaret, Westminster]] on 10 October 1666, the 'day of humiliation and fasting' after the [[Great Fire of London]], with such an attendance that there was standing room only. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded that he could not get in to hear the sermon, eating a meal of herrings in a pub instead.<ref>Adrian Tinniswood, ''By Permission of Heaven: The Story of the Great Fire of London'' (2003), p. 181.</ref>\n\nHe then held many [[preferment]]s, including a [[chaplain|Royal Chaplaincy]], and the [[Dean of St Paul's|Deanery of St Paul's]] (1678), the latter involving him in work connected with the building of the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He became [[Bishop of Worcester]] in 1689. He was a frequent speaker in the [[House of Lords]], and had considerable influence as a churchman.\n\nHe supported [[Richard Bentley]], who lived in his household as a tutor for a number of years, from shortly after his graduation in 1693. Bentley would later be his chaplain and biographer, and describe him as \"one of the most universal scholars that ever lived\".<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bentley, Richard (scholar) |display=Bentley, Richard |volume=3 |page=750}}</ref><ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45118 british-history.ac.uk</ref>\n\nIn 1691, at his request, [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] wrote to the magistrates of [[Middlesex]], asking for stronger enforcement of the laws against [[vice]]. This was an early move in the campaign of the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]].<ref>Deborah Payne Fisk, ''The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre'' (20000, p. 212.</ref>\n\nAt his death Stillingfleet left a library of some 10,000 printed books, which were purchased by [[Narcissus Marsh]] and today are part of [[Marsh's Library]] in Dublin, Ireland. His manuscript collection was purchased by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (1661\u20131724), and passed with the Harleian Manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 as one of the foundation collections.\n\n==Patronage, politics and views==\nStillingfleet had to wait many years for a bishopric, a fact linked to his disfavour at Court in the 1680s. He never, though, lacked for well-connected patrons. The first was [[Sir Roger Burgoyne, 2nd Baronet]], a barrister and MP in the [[Long Parliament]], in whose gift was [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]], his living; followed by Francis Pierrepont, a Parliamentarian colonel and younger brother of [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester]] (a Royalist) and [[William Pierrepont (politician)|William Pierrepont]] (like Francis a Parliamentarian). These both offered him tutoring positions.

[[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]] presented Stillingfleet to St Andrew, Holborn. [[Humphrey Henchman]], [[Bishop of London]], employed him to write a vindication of [[William Laud]]'s answer to [[John Percy]] (''alias'' Fisher).<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\"/> According to Jon Parkin,\n\n{{cquote|The apparent ease with which younger writers like Stillingfleet squared their allegiance to the restored regime, coupled with their espousal of a naturalistic, [[erastian]] and apparently [[Hobbesian]] [[ecclesiology]], earned them the description of 'men of latitude'.}}\n\nStillingfleet was a leader within the Church of England of the \"[[latitudinarian]]s\", the group of Anglicans thus defined pejoratively. Latitudinarism as doctrine was considered to have grown from the teaching of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], but in practical terms conditions at the Restoration did not favour it. Quite a number of its Cambridge adherents left an unpromising career in religion for the law, or had to rely for patronage on those who had done so.<ref>Parkin, p. 27.</ref>\n\nStillingfleet was most closely associated, in his attitudes, with such as [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Isaac Barrow]], [[Robert South]] and [[John Tillotson]].

Young, ''Religion and Enlightenment in Eighteenth-Century England: Theological Debate from Locke to Burke'' (1998), p. 190.</ref> With Tillotson he favoured the so-called Erastian view, that the ruler had great powers over the Church, from the days of 1660; after the [[Glorious Revolution]] they became [[Low Church]] moderates.<ref>Tony Claydon, ''Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760'' (2007), p. 330.</ref> With [[Gilbert Burnet]], [[Benjamin Hoadly]], [[Simon Patrick]], [[William Powell (clergyman)|William Powell]] and [[William Whiston]], he held some [[High Church]] views also.<ref>William Gibson, ''Altitudinarian Equivocation: George Smalridge's Churchmanship'', p. 57 in William Gibson, Robert G.
