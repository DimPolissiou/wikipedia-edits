Among them are ''ijma'', ''qiya'', ''ijtihad'' and others depending on sect and the school of Islamic law. Included in secondary sources are [[fatwa]]s, which are often widely distributed, orally or in writing by Muslim clerics, to the masses, in local language and describe behavior, roles and rights of women that conforms with religious requirements. Fatwas are theoretically non-binding, but seriously considered and have often been practiced by most Muslim believers. The secondary sources typically fall into five types of influence: the declared role or behavior for Muslims, both women and men, is considered obligatory, commendable, permissible, despised or prohibited.

Therefore, they also are required to complete all the duties of a Muslim worshiper, including the completion of religious traditions, specifically the pilgrimage to Mecca. Islamic culture marked a movement towards liberation and equality for women, since prior Arab cultures did not enable women to have such freedoms. Now, women in Islam are even entitled to their own right to land. There is evidence that Muhammad asked women for advice and took their thoughts into account, specifically with regard to the Quran. Women were allowed to pray with men, take part in commercial interactions, and played a role in education. One of Muhammad\u2019s wives, Aisah, played a significant role in medicine, history and rhetoric. Women, however, did not hold religious titles, but some held political power with their husbands or own their own. The historic role of women in Islam is connected to societal patriarchal ideals, rather than actual ties to the Quran.

[[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Quran, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oneworld Publisher|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=275\u2013276}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, numerous prominent scholars in the tradition of Orthodox Islam have issued fatwas (legal opinions) against domestic violence.

God does not create the organs of the body haphazardly without a plan. It is not possible that He should have created the clitoris in woman's body only in order that it be cut off at an early stage in life. This is a contradiction into which neither true religion nor the Creator could possibly fall. If God has created the clitoris as a sexually sensitive organ, whose sole function seems to be the procurement of sexual pleasure for women, it follows that He also considers such pleasure for women as normal and legitimate, and therefore as an integral part of mental health.\"<ref name=\"Jawad 1998 129\">{{Cite book|title=The Rights of Women in Islam: An Authentic Approach|last=Jawad|first=Haifaa|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=978-0333734582|location=London, England|pages=129}}</ref>\n\n[[Sheikh Abbas|Sheikh Abbas el Hocine Bencheikh]], a diplomat and Rector of the L'institut Musulman at the Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Paris, pointed to the total lack of Islamic theological justification for female circumcision: \"If circumcision for the man (though not compulsory) has an aesthetic and hygienic purpose, there is no existing religious Islamic text of value to be considered in favour of female excision, as proven by the fact that this practice is totally non-existent in most of the Islamic countries.\"<ref name=\"Jawad 1998 58\"/>\n\n[[Mahmud Shaltut]], the former Sheikh of Al-Azhar in Cairo \u2013 one of the most important religious offices in Sunni Islam \u2013 also stated that female circumcision has no theological basis: \"Islamic legislation provides a general principle, namely that should meticulous and careful examination of certain issues prove that it is definitely harmful or immoral, then it should be legitimately stopped to put an end to this damage or immorality.

A ''tafriq'' is a divorce for certain allowable reasons. This divorce is granted by a ''qadi'', a religious judge, in cases where the ''qadi'' accepts her claims of abuse or abandonment. If a tafriq is denied by the ''qadi'', she cannot divorce. If a tafriq is granted, the marriage is dissolved and the husband is obligated to pay her the deferred [[mahr]] in their marriage contract. The second method, by far more common in wife-initiated divorces, ''khul'' is a divorce without cause, by mutual consent. This divorce requires a husband's consent and it must be supported by consideration that passes from the wife to the husband. Often, this consideration almost always consists of the wife relinquishing her claim to the deferred mahr. In actual practice and outside of Islamic judicial theory, a woman's right to divorce is often extremely limited compared with that of men in the Middle East.<ref name=\"divorceenc\">Joseph and Najmabadi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Uyypm6T7ZsC&pg=RA1-PA100&ots=2K5j-yYVmK&dq=women+divorce+rights+islam&sig=YXS2kjkb7KhQ37NZBsi8pn6e8zo#PRA1-PA99,M1 p99].</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the comparatively limited methods of divorce available to a woman, Islam allows a Muslim husband to unilaterally divorce his wife, as ''talaq'', with no requirement to show cause; however, in practice there is variance by country as to whether there are any additional legal processes when a husband divorces his wife by this method. For example, the Tunisian Law of Personal Status (1957) makes repudiation by a husband invalid until it has been ratified by a court, and provides for further financial compensation to the wife.<ref name=\"Glass\u00e9 1989 100\u2013101\" /> Similar laws have been enacted elsewhere, both within an interpretive framework of traditional shar\u012b'ah law, and through the operation of civil codes not based upon the shar\u012b'ah.<ref name=\"Glass\u00e9 1989 100\u2013101\" /> However, upon talaq, the husband must pay the wife her deferred mahr.<ref>WAEL B. HALLAQ, SHARIA: THEORY, PRACTICE, TRANSFORMATIONS 271 (2009)</ref> Some Muslim-majority countries mandate additional financial contributions to be made to the wife on top of the mahr: for example, the Syrian Law of Personal Status (1953) makes the payment of maintenance to the wife by the husband obligatory for one year after the divorce, which is thus a legal recourse of the wife against the husband.<ref name=\"Glass\u00e9 1989 100\u2013101\" /> The husband is free to marry again immediately after a divorce, but the woman must observe ''[[iddah]]'', that is wait for 3 lunar months<ref>{{Cite quran|2|228}}</ref> before she can remarry after divorce, to establish paternity, in case she discovers she is pregnant.

'''Lack of scriptural validity'''. The Sorbonne-educated Franco-Bosnian academic [[Jasna \u0160ami\u0107]] has posited that the term \"\u1e25ij\u0101b\" does not have any connection with the noun or concept of \"headscarf\": \"The expression hijab in the Koran means 'the veil hiding God'. In other words one can never see and get to know God, because our intellect is too weak [to fully comprehend Him].\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/04/the-hijab-to-wear-or-not-wear.html|title=The hijab: To wear or not to wear?|last=\u0160ami\u0107|first=Jasna|date=4 March 2016|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> Other analysts have pointed out that the Quranic verse most cited in defence of the \u1e25ij\u0101b (S\u016brat al-A\u1e25z\u0101b, [http://al-quran.info/#33:59 33:59]) does not mention this article of clothing at all; instead, it references a \"long, overflowing gown\" which was the traditional dress at the time of this revelation.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\n2. '''Lack of historical authenticity'''. Similarly, it has been noted that the \u1e25ij\u0101b as worn today is historically alien to the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is illustrated by an incident involving [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. During his rule as the 2nd President of Egypt (1956-1970), Nasser was given a list of demands by the Supreme Leader of the [Muslim] Brotherhood as part of a process of political reconciliation. This list included \"imposing \u1e25ij\u0101b on Muslim women\": \"The audience members didn't understand what the word '\u1e25ij\u0101b' meant. When Nasser explained that the Brotherhood wanted Egyptian women to wear a headscarf, the audience members burst out laughing.\"<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/21/as-muslim-women-we-actually-ask-you-not-to-wear-the-hijab-in-the-name-of-interfaith-solidarity/|title=As Muslim women, we actually ask you not to wear the hijab in the name of interfaith solidarity|last=Nomani|first=Asra Q.|date=21 December 2015|work=The Washington Post|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=This historical claim is not noted in the source, only Gamal's statement is. Either it is a case of WP:synthesis or a failed verification.|date=July 2017}}\n\n3. '''Superficiality'''. The rise of the \u1e25ij\u0101b in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has been criticised as \"reverse objectification\", whereby women are primarily judged by what they wear as opposed to their broader conduct as human beings, despite their ostensibly modest dress. The Singaporean writer Sya Taha has expressed this as follows: \"In any commercial magazine targeted at Muslim women, compare the number of pages dedicated to hijab styling or makeup with sport, art, music, humanitarian work or science...In contrast, Muslim women that do not wear hijab are often framed as though they must justify and reconcile how they can identify as Muslim women.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/fashionbeauty/shopping/the-hijab-obsession-moving-on/38500/|title=The hijab obsession: moving on\u2026|last=Taha|first=Sya|date=20 April 2015|website=Aquila Style|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n4. '''Consumerism'''. [[Shelina Zahra Janmohamed]], the author and Vice President of brand consultancy Ogilvy Noor, has warned that the rise of contemporary Islamic fashion as exemplified by the \u1e25ij\u0101b risks being overwhelmed by the '\"consumerism and objectification\" of the mainstream fashion industry: \"Muslim fashion is teetering between asserting a Muslim woman's right to be beautiful and well-turned out, and buying more stuff than you need, and being judged by your clothes \u2013 both of which are the opposite of Islamic values.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-the-hijab-went-high-fashion-and-divided-muslim-women/|title=How the hijab went high-fashion and divided Muslim women|last=Sanghani|first=Radhika|date=18 February 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n5. '''Commercialism and Exploitation'''. Finally, the concern that the \u1e25ij\u0101b is being promoted for commercial rather than religious reasons is a live one. For example, the promoter of \"[[World Hijab Day]]\" \u2013 an event which began in 2013, and which encourages non-Muslim women to try out \u1e25ij\u0101bs \u2013 is a Bangladeshi-American owner of a headscarf company, which typifies the prevalent [[conflict of interest]] issues.<ref name=\":9\" /> Similarly, the popularisation of the [[Tudong|''tudung'']] \u1e25ij\u0101b in Malaysia has been characterised as an exercise in \"cashing in\" on a trend that is part of a multibillion-dollar industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/tudung-industry-in-malaysia-cashing-in-on-conservative-islam|title=Tudung industry in Malaysia: Cashing in on conservative Islam|last=Boo|first=Su-Lyn|date=10 May 2015|work=Malay Mail|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> Additionally, the fact many of these \u1e25ij\u0101b garments are made by poorly-paid (often Muslim) women in developing countries contravenes the Quranic precepts of consuming without abuse ([http://al-quran.info/#2:60 2:60]) or oppressing others ([http://al-quran.info/#20:81 20:81]).<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Effect of globalisation on Muslim women's couture ===\n[[File:Sahabat (5761248957).jpg|thumb|229x229px|Two Malaysian women wearing contrasting styles of clothing: the (post-)modern ''[[hijab]]'' on the one hand (left), and a variant of the traditional Islamic ''[[kebaya]]'' blouse-shirt combination on the other.

Firstly, retail outlets for Western fashion labels are now commonly found in OIC member states: to give but one example, Calvin Klein has stores from the [[Citypark Albania|Citypark shopping mall]] in Tirana, Albania to the [[Plaza Indonesia]] mall in Jakarta. Secondly, fashion labels specialising in modest attire (particularly but not exclusively the hijab or headscarf worn by some Muslim women) have sprung up in a number of OIC states and observer countries.\n\nThirdly, in addition to the many already existing fashion schools in Islamic world, branches of international fashion schools have opened across the OIC: most notably, the Paris-based ''\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure des arts et techniques de la mode'' or [[ESMOD]] has branch campuses in Beirut (established in 1999),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-beyrouth|title = ESMOD BEYROUTH|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD BEYROUTH|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Damascus (1995),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-damas|title = ESMOD DAMAS|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD DAMAS|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Dubai (2006),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-dubai|title = ESMOD DUBAI|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD DUBAI|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Istanbul (2010),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-istanbul|title = ESMOD ISTANBUL|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD ISTANBUL|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Kuala Lumpur (2012),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-kuala-lumpur|title = ESMOD KUALA LUMPUR|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD KUALA LUMPUR|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Jakarta (1996),<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-jakarta|title = ESMOD JAKARTA|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD JAKARTA|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Sousse (1989) and Tunis (1989).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-sousse|title = ESMOD SOUSSE|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD SOUSSE|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esmod.com/fr/content/esmod-tunis|title = ESMOD TUNIS|date = |accessdate = 8 July 2015|website = ESMOD TUNIS|publisher = ESMOD Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme}}</ref> Fourthly, numerous fashion weeks have been inaugurated in many Muslim-majority countries: some of the more prestigious ones include [http://www.cairofashionweek.com/ Cairo] (first run in 2015),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ww.egyptindependent.com/cairo-fashion-week-promises-modish-extravaganza/|title=Cairo Fashion Week promises modish extravaganza|last=El-Behary|first=Hend|date=27 December 2016|work=Egypt Independent|access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref> [[Jakarta Fashion Week|Jakarta]] (2008), [https://www.klfashionweek.com/ Kuala Lumpur] (2013), the [http://pfdc.org/ Pakistan Fashion Design Council Fashion Week] (2010) and [http://mbfwistanbul.com/ Fashion Week Istanbul] (2010).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/fashion/2018/03/27/istanbul-fashion-week-takes-its-turn-with-dynamic-start|title=Istanbul fashion week takes its turn with dynamic start|last=G\u00fcrb\u00fcz|first=\u015eeyma Nazl\u0131|date=26 March 2018|work=Daily Sabah|access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFifthly, the fashion media sector within the Muslim world for both Western and Islamic fashion has grown tremendously from the 1990s onwards.

Prominent examples of these processes include the syncretist philosophy of ''[[Din-i Ilahi|d\u012bn-i-il\u0101h\u012b]]'' (\"religion of God\"), an amalgam of several religions devised by Emperor [[Akbar]] (1542-1605) that was practiced at the [[Mughul]] Court in India;<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam|last=Glass\u00e9|first=Cyril|publisher=Stacey International|year=1989|isbn=|location=London, England|pages=272}}</ref> the crypto-Christianity of Kosovo, a belief system that created a tradition of joint Catholic-Muslim households which persisted into the twentieth century;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kosovo: A Short History|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=978-0333666128|location=London and Basingstoke|pages=129\u2013134}}</ref> and ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'', the official foundational philosophy of the modern Indonesian state which draws on indigenous beliefs, as well as Hindu, Christian and Islamic traditions.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, a number of new factors have facilitated the comparison of spiritual traditions \u2013 and the place of women within them \u2013 to an unprecedented level. These include: (i) a fresh wave of technological globalisation, which has obliterated communicational borders; (ii) the advent of cheap mass international air travel, which has hugely increased people's exposure to other cultures; and (iii) the internationalisation of higher education, whereby students and scholars alike are spending ever-increasing amounts of time in countries with different religious demographic compositions to their own.\n\nNotwithstanding these developments, comparing the position of women in Islam with that of women in other faith traditions is complicated by the following determinants: \n# '''Geographical and cultural breadth'''. Given that the Muslim world encompasses states as diverse as Albania, Mali and Kazakhstan, diverse interpretations of texts such as the Quran are inevitable, although there are also large areas of concordance between the orthodox schools of Islamic thought, both Sunni and Shi'a. The prevalence of cultural customs which are sometimes ascribed to Islam but which have at best a tenuous scriptural basis (and that in fact may be diametrically opposed to the teachings of the religion) is another element which needs to be recognised.\n# '''Scholarly differences'''. When analysing both Islam in general and the topic of women in Islam in particular, the views of scholars and commentators are profoundly shaped by certain cultural lenses. Those coming from a Western background, such as the Switzerland-born writer [[Gai Eaton|Charles le Gai Eaton]], tend to compare and contrast Islam with Christianity; Eaton concluded that Islam, with certain important qualifications, was \"essentially patriarchal\". Conversely, those coming from an East Asian background tend to emphasise similarities between Islam and religions such as Taoism, which stress complementarity between the sexes: according to the Japanese scholar Sachiko Murata, it was mandatory for her to use the ''[[I Ching]]'' as a means of \"[conceptualising] Islamic teachings on the feminine principle without doing violence to the original texts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tao of Islam: A Sourcebook on Gender Relationships in Islamic Thought|last=Murata|first=Sachiko|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0791409145|location=Albany, NY|pages=6}}</ref> \n# '''Political distortions'''. The historical strength of various Muslim-led polities \u2013 which, unlike other comparable non-Western entities such as China and Japan, were adjacent to \"Christian\" Europe and/or perceived to be in competition with Western powers \u2013 meant that the question of women in Islam has not always been approached objectively by those professing expertise in the subject. This can be viewed as part of the \"[[Orientalism|Orientalist]]\" academic discourse (as defined by [[Edward Said]]) that creates a rigid East-West dichotomy in which dynamic and positive values are ascribed to Western civilisation; by contrast, \"Oriental\" societies (including but certainly not limited to Islamic ones) are depicted as being \"stationary\" and in need of \"modernising\" through imperial administrations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Sociology|last=Abercrombie|first=Nicholas|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0140513806|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Eve's role in the Fall ===\nIn contrast with the biblical account of [[Fall of man|the Fall]], in Islamic tradition Eve (\u1e24aww\u0101) did not tempt Adam (\u0100dam) to eat the forbidden fruit; instead, they were tempted together by the Devil. This means that Eve was not the cause of Adam's expulsion from paradise: he was also responsible, and therefore both men and women are faced equally with its consequences. This has a number of important implications for the Islamic understanding of womanhood and women's roles in both religious and social life.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Heart of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity|last = Nasr|first = Seyyed Hossein|publisher = HarperSanFrancisco|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-06-073064-2|location = New York|page = 15}}</ref> For one, in Islam, women are not seen as a source of evil as a result of the Fall.<ref name=\"Eaton 2000 88\">{{Cite book|title = Remembering God: Reflections on Islam|last = Eaton|first = Gai|publisher = The Islamic Texts Society|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-946621-84-2|location = Cambridge, England|pages = [https://archive.org/details/rememberinggodre0000eato/page/88 88]|url = https://archive.org/details/rememberinggodre0000eato/page/88}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the Biblical statement that Eve was created from Adam's rib (the famous 'third rib') finds no echo in the Quranic account: both male and female were created 'from one soul' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150501064500/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php S\u016brah 4:1]).<ref name=\"Eaton 2000 88\" /> Similarly, the concept that (as per [http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm Genesis 3:16]) the pains of childbirth are a punishment for Eve's sin is alien to the Quran.<ref name=\"Eaton 2000 88\" />\n\n=== The Virgin Mary ===\nThe [[Mary in Islam|Virgin Mary]] (Mary\u0101m) is considered by the Quran to hold the most exalted spiritual position amongst women.

However, its general approach to sexuality is profoundly distinct to that of Christianity.

Among them are ''ijma'', ''qiya'', ''ijtihad'' and others depending on sect and the school of Islamic law. Included in secondary sources are [[fatwa]]s, which are often widely distributed, orally or in writing by Muslim clerics, to the masses, in local language and describe behavior, roles and rights of women that conforms with religious requirements. Fatwas are theoretically non-binding, but seriously considered and have often been practiced by most Muslim believers. The secondary sources typically fall into five types of influence: the declared role or behavior for Muslims, both women and men, is considered obligatory, commendable, permissible, despised or prohibited. There is considerable controversy, change over time, and conflict between the secondary sources.<ref>Agrama, H. A. (2010). \"Ethics, tradition, authority: Toward an anthropology of the fatwa\".

Therefore, they also are required to complete all the duties of a Muslim worshiper, including the completion of religious traditions, specifically the pilgrimage to Mecca. Islamic culture marked a movement towards liberation and equality for women, since prior Arab cultures did not enable women to have such freedoms. Now, women in Islam are even entitled to their own right to land. There is evidence that Muhammad asked women for advice and took their thoughts into account, specifically with regard to the Quran. Women were allowed to pray with men, take part in commercial interactions, and played a role in education. One of Muhammad\u2019s wives, Aisah, played a significant role in medicine, history and rhetoric. Women, however, did not hold religious titles, but some held political power with their husbands or own their own.

Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Quran, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oneworld Publisher|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=275\u2013276}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, numerous prominent scholars in the tradition of Orthodox Islam have issued fatwas (legal opinions) against domestic violence.

Throughout Islamic history, intellectuals, theologians, and mystics have extensively discussed the nature and characteristics of romantic love ('''ishq'').<ref name=EI2-ishk/> In its most common intellectual interpretation of the [[Golden age of Islam|Islamic Golden Age]], ''ishq'' refers to an irresistible desire to obtain possession of the beloved, expressing a deficiency that the lover must remedy in order to reach perfection.<ref name=EI2-ishk/> Like the perfections of the soul and the body, love thus admits of hierarchical degrees, but its underlying reality is the aspiration to the beauty which God manifested in the world when he created Adam in his own image.<ref name=EI2-ishk/>\n\nThe Arab love story of [[Layla and Majnun|L\u0101yla and Majn\u016bn]] was arguably more widely known amongst Muslims than that of Romeo and Juliet in (Northern) Europe,<ref name=\":3\" /> while [[Jami|J\u0101m\u012b]]'s retelling of the story of [[Yusuf and Zulaikha|Yusuf (Joseph) and Zulaykh\u0101]] \u2014 based upon the narrative of [[Yusuf (surah)|Surat Yusuf]] in the Quran \u2014 is a seminal text in the Persian, Urdu, and Bengali literary canons.

[[Ibn Arabi|Ibn 'Arab\u012b]] reflected on the above \u1e25ad\u012bth as follows: \"\u2026.he [Mu\u1e25ammad] mentioned women [as one of three things from God's world made lovable to him]. Do you think that which would take him far from his Lord was made lovable to him? Of course not. That which would bring him near to his Lord was made lovable to him.\n\n\"He who knows the measure of women and their mystery will not renounce love for them.

A ''tafriq'' is a divorce for certain allowable reasons. This divorce is granted by a ''qadi'', a religious judge, in cases where the ''qadi'' accepts her claims of abuse or abandonment. If a tafriq is denied by the ''qadi'', she cannot divorce. If a tafriq is granted, the marriage is dissolved and the husband is obligated to pay her the deferred [[mahr]] in their marriage contract. The second method, by far more common in wife-initiated divorces, ''khul'' is a divorce without cause, by mutual consent. This divorce requires a husband's consent and it must be supported by consideration that passes from the wife to the husband.

For example, the Tunisian Law of Personal Status (1957) makes repudiation by a husband invalid until it has been ratified by a court, and provides for further financial compensation to the wife.<ref name=\"Glass\u00e9 1989 100\u2013101\" /> Similar laws have been enacted elsewhere, both within an interpretive framework of traditional shar\u012b'ah law, and through the operation of civil codes not based upon the shar\u012b'ah.<ref name=\"Glass\u00e9 1989 100\u2013101\" /> However, upon talaq, the husband must pay the wife her deferred mahr.<ref>WAEL B.

'''Lack of scriptural validity'''. The Sorbonne-educated Franco-Bosnian academic [[Jasna \u0160ami\u0107]] has posited that the term \"\u1e25ij\u0101b\" does not have any connection with the noun or concept of \"headscarf\": \"The expression hijab in the Koran means 'the veil hiding God'. In other words one can never see and get to know God, because our intellect is too weak [to fully comprehend Him].\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/04/the-hijab-to-wear-or-not-wear.html|title=The hijab: To wear or not to wear?|last=\u0160ami\u0107|first=Jasna|date=4 March 2016|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> Other analysts have pointed out that the Quranic verse most cited in defence of the \u1e25ij\u0101b (S\u016brat al-A\u1e25z\u0101b, [http://al-quran.info/#33:59 33:59]) does not mention this article of clothing at all; instead, it references a \"long, overflowing gown\" which was the traditional dress at the time of this revelation.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\n2. '''Lack of historical authenticity'''. Similarly, it has been noted that the \u1e25ij\u0101b as worn today is historically alien to the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is illustrated by an incident involving [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. During his rule as the 2nd President of Egypt (1956-1970), Nasser was given a list of demands by the Supreme Leader of the [Muslim] Brotherhood as part of a process of political reconciliation. This list included \"imposing \u1e25ij\u0101b on Muslim women\": \"The audience members didn't understand what the word '\u1e25ij\u0101b' meant. When Nasser explained that the Brotherhood wanted Egyptian women to wear a headscarf, the audience members burst out laughing.\"<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/21/as-muslim-women-we-actually-ask-you-not-to-wear-the-hijab-in-the-name-of-interfaith-solidarity/|title=As Muslim women, we actually ask you not to wear the hijab in the name of interfaith solidarity|last=Nomani|first=Asra Q.|date=21 December 2015|work=The Washington Post|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=This historical claim is not noted in the source, only Gamal's statement is.

The rise of the \u1e25ij\u0101b in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has been criticised as \"reverse objectification\", whereby women are primarily judged by what they wear as opposed to their broader conduct as human beings, despite their ostensibly modest dress. The Singaporean writer Sya Taha has expressed this as follows: \"In any commercial magazine targeted at Muslim women, compare the number of pages dedicated to hijab styling or makeup with sport, art, music, humanitarian work or science...In contrast, Muslim women that do not wear hijab are often framed as though they must justify and reconcile how they can identify as Muslim women.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/fashionbeauty/shopping/the-hijab-obsession-moving-on/38500/|title=The hijab obsession: moving on\u2026|last=Taha|first=Sya|date=20 April 2015|website=Aquila Style|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n4. '''Consumerism'''. [[Shelina Zahra Janmohamed]], the author and Vice President of brand consultancy Ogilvy Noor, has warned that the rise of contemporary Islamic fashion as exemplified by the \u1e25ij\u0101b risks being overwhelmed by the '\"consumerism and objectification\" of the mainstream fashion industry: \"Muslim fashion is teetering between asserting a Muslim woman's right to be beautiful and well-turned out, and buying more stuff than you need, and being judged by your clothes \u2013 both of which are the opposite of Islamic values.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-the-hijab-went-high-fashion-and-divided-muslim-women/|title=How the hijab went high-fashion and divided Muslim women|last=Sanghani|first=Radhika|date=18 February 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n5. '''Commercialism and Exploitation'''. Finally, the concern that the \u1e25ij\u0101b is being promoted for commercial rather than religious reasons is a live one. For example, the promoter of \"[[World Hijab Day]]\" \u2013 an event which began in 2013, and which encourages non-Muslim women to try out \u1e25ij\u0101bs \u2013 is a Bangladeshi-American owner of a headscarf company, which typifies the prevalent [[conflict of interest]] issues.<ref name=\":9\" /> Similarly, the popularisation of the [[Tudong|''tudung'']] \u1e25ij\u0101b in Malaysia has been characterised as an exercise in \"cashing in\" on a trend that is part of a multibillion-dollar industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/tudung-industry-in-malaysia-cashing-in-on-conservative-islam|title=Tudung industry in Malaysia: Cashing in on conservative Islam|last=Boo|first=Su-Lyn|date=10 May 2015|work=Malay Mail|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> Additionally, the fact many of these \u1e25ij\u0101b garments are made by poorly-paid (often Muslim) women in developing countries contravenes the Quranic precepts of consuming without abuse ([http://al-quran.info/#2:60 2:60]) or oppressing others ([http://al-quran.info/#20:81 20:81]).<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Effect of globalisation on Muslim women's couture ===\n[[File:Sahabat (5761248957).jpg|thumb|229x229px|Two Malaysian women wearing contrasting styles of clothing: the (post-)modern ''[[hijab]]'' on the one hand (left), and a variant of the traditional Islamic ''[[kebaya]]'' blouse-shirt combination on the other.

Prominent examples of these processes include the syncretist philosophy of ''[[Din-i Ilahi|d\u012bn-i-il\u0101h\u012b]]'' (\"religion of God\"), an amalgam of several religions devised by Emperor [[Akbar]] (1542-1605) that was practiced at the [[Mughul]] Court in India;<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam|last=Glass\u00e9|first=Cyril|publisher=Stacey International|year=1989|isbn=|location=London, England|pages=272}}</ref> the crypto-Christianity of Kosovo, a belief system that created a tradition of joint Catholic-Muslim households which persisted into the twentieth century;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kosovo: A Short History|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=978-0333666128|location=London and Basingstoke|pages=129\u2013134}}</ref> and ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'', the official foundational philosophy of the modern Indonesian state which draws on indigenous beliefs, as well as Hindu, Christian and Islamic traditions.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, a number of new factors have facilitated the comparison of spiritual traditions \u2013 and the place of women within them \u2013 to an unprecedented level. These include: (i) a fresh wave of technological globalisation, which has obliterated communicational borders; (ii) the advent of cheap mass international air travel, which has hugely increased people's exposure to other cultures; and (iii) the internationalisation of higher education, whereby students and scholars alike are spending ever-increasing amounts of time in countries with different religious demographic compositions to their own.\n\nNotwithstanding these developments, comparing the position of women in Islam with that of women in other faith traditions is complicated by the following determinants: \n# '''Geographical and cultural breadth'''. Given that the Muslim world encompasses states as diverse as Albania, Mali and Kazakhstan, diverse interpretations of texts such as the Quran are inevitable, although there are also large areas of concordance between the orthodox schools of Islamic thought, both Sunni and Shi'a. The prevalence of cultural customs which are sometimes ascribed to Islam but which have at best a tenuous scriptural basis (and that in fact may be diametrically opposed to the teachings of the religion) is another element which needs to be recognised.\n# '''Scholarly differences'''. When analysing both Islam in general and the topic of women in Islam in particular, the views of scholars and commentators are profoundly shaped by certain cultural lenses. Those coming from a Western background, such as the Switzerland-born writer [[Gai Eaton|Charles le Gai Eaton]], tend to compare and contrast Islam with Christianity; Eaton concluded that Islam, with certain important qualifications, was \"essentially patriarchal\". Conversely, those coming from an East Asian background tend to emphasise similarities between Islam and religions such as Taoism, which stress complementarity between the sexes: according to the Japanese scholar Sachiko Murata, it was mandatory for her to use the ''[[I Ching]]'' as a means of \"[conceptualising] Islamic teachings on the feminine principle without doing violence to the original texts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tao of Islam: A Sourcebook on Gender Relationships in Islamic Thought|last=Murata|first=Sachiko|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0791409145|location=Albany, NY|pages=6}}</ref> \n# '''Political distortions'''. The historical strength of various Muslim-led polities \u2013 which, unlike other comparable non-Western entities such as China and Japan, were adjacent to \"Christian\" Europe and/or perceived to be in competition with Western powers \u2013 meant that the question of women in Islam has not always been approached objectively by those professing expertise in the subject. This can be viewed as part of the \"[[Orientalism|Orientalist]]\" academic discourse (as defined by [[Edward Said]]) that creates a rigid East-West dichotomy in which dynamic and positive values are ascribed to Western civilisation; by contrast, \"Oriental\" societies (including but certainly not limited to Islamic ones) are depicted as being \"stationary\" and in need of \"modernising\" through imperial administrations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Sociology|last=Abercrombie|first=Nicholas|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0140513806|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Eve's role in the Fall ===\nIn contrast with the biblical account of [[Fall of man|the Fall]], in Islamic tradition Eve (\u1e24aww\u0101) did not tempt Adam (\u0100dam) to eat the forbidden fruit; instead, they were tempted together by the Devil. This means that Eve was not the cause of Adam's expulsion from paradise: he was also responsible, and therefore both men and women are faced equally with its consequences. This has a number of important implications for the Islamic understanding of womanhood and women's roles in both religious and social life.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Heart of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity|last = Nasr|first = Seyyed Hossein|publisher = HarperSanFrancisco|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-06-073064-2|location = New York|page = 15}}</ref> For one, in Islam, women are not seen as a source of evil as a result of the Fall.<ref name=\"Eaton 2000 88\">{{Cite book|title = Remembering God: Reflections on Islam|last = Eaton|first = Gai|publisher = The Islamic Texts Society|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-946621-84-2|location = Cambridge, England|pages = [https://archive.org/details/rememberinggodre0000eato/page/88 88]|url = https://archive.org/details/rememberinggodre0000eato/page/88}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the Biblical statement that Eve was created from Adam's rib (the famous 'third rib') finds no echo in the Quranic account: both male and female were created 'from one soul' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150501064500/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php S\u016brah 4:1]).<ref name=\"Eaton 2000 88\" /> Similarly, the concept that (as per [http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm Genesis 3:16]) the pains of childbirth are a punishment for Eve's sin is alien to the Quran.<ref name=\"Eaton 2000 88\" />\n\n=== The Virgin Mary ===\nThe [[Mary in Islam|Virgin Mary]] (Mary\u0101m) is considered by the Quran to hold the most exalted spiritual position amongst women.

The first settlers were captained by Jo\u00e3o Soares, from the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], and who settled in [[Lajedo (Lajes das Flores)|Lajedo]]. The fertile land permitted the cultivation of [[woad]], one of the most important commercial ventures in  the Azores. As the Azorean chronicler Father [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] writing in the 16th Century, indicated, that the colonists benefited from the abundance of water and easy access to the sea:\n:''\"There, about a quarter league is Faj\u00e3, called \"Big\" [referring to its name Great/Grande Faj\u00e3] which offers bread and woad on elevated land, with a few berths for [[Caravel]]s, it produces at least 50 moios [Portuguese unit of solid measure] of bread and woad, and where, also, there is shellfish and fish of all kinds, and along its cape a beach, half a league in size, where there is always a strong ocean current; and from there, another half a league, the cliffs are covered with much urzela [a lichen], and large rocks, that spawn an infinity of seafood and large crabs, and from here, there is an explosion of rocks that fall to the sea, like a guns spray, where we find [[limpet]]s and [[Cowry|cowrie shells]]; and in front of this point, which forms a bay, where many type of ships anchor, including [[Carracks]] from [[Portuguese India|India]].  In the middle of this anchorage a great river-valley falls from the cliffs to sea.\"''\n\nAlthough being populated for less than a century, Faj\u00e3 Grande was already a center of commercial activity; caravels arriving from India were likely to stopover in Faj\u00e3 Grande since it was one of the first ports to be discovered on their return.  On the port of Faj\u00e3 Grande, Father [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es]], noted the  following about its installations:\n:''\"...there is a small breakwater called Baixa  d\u2019Agoa. Continue down until you get to the port of Faj\u00e3 Grande, which  has in the middle a great mound of sand and rock called Calhau da Barra.  Within this Calhau is a large \"puddle\" called the Po\u00e7\u00e3o, which gives  refuge to ships that arrive from the sea.\"''\n\nThe fertility of the land permitted the cultivation of the lichen ''Rocella tinctoria'' ([[Roccellaceae]]), a plant sought after by many of the commercial interests in the region eager to support the dye industries of Europe. The abundance of fresh water, and port, also made Faj\u00e3 Grande an important stopover for pirates and privateers; while other communities in the archipelago lived in fear of pirates, Faj\u00e3 Grande maintained a collaborative relationship and sold consumables to local crews.\n\nIt was likely one of the most prosperous communities in the western coast, resulting in its de-annexation from the neighbouring parish of [[Lajes das Flores (parish)|Lajes das Flores]], in July 1676. To create the new parish of ''Faj\u00e3s'', the local community in Ponta da Faj\u00e3 was de-annexed from the neighbouring parish of S\u00e3o Pedro de Ponta Delgada and integrated into the new administrative and ecclesiastical division. The formal delimitation of the parish was presided by Father Domingos Nunes Pereira, and the new Faj\u00e3s parish priest Father Andr\u00e9 Alves de Mendon\u00e7a, on 12/13 July 1676.\n\nWriting around 1720, Father [[Ant\u00f3nio Cordeiro]], affirmed that the Faj\u00e3s included about 80 homes. The creation of an autonomous parish in Faj\u00e3 Grande dates back to 1855, when the administration of the District of Horta attempted to resolve the call by its residents to create a new civil parish.  The debate was finally ended by the Civil Governor, Lu\u00eds Teixeira de Sampaio, who reported on 3 April 1857, that a single parish of Faj\u00e3 Grande was desirable, owing to its distance from the community of [[Faj\u00e3zinha]] (then parish seat), the size of its community, and the problem caused by annual floodings along the Riberia Grande river, which regularly cut links annually.  Local narratives mention several instances when the Ribeira Grande impeded travel to Faj\u00e3zinha, resulting in the faithful having services at the ''Pedra da Missa'' ({{lang-en|Stone of Mass}}), an elevated point on the river bank where they gathered, prayed and then dispersed after celebrating the liturgy. Governor Sampaio also noted that American whaling and high-seas travel had brought a new importance to the village, also justifying a rethink of the existing administrative divisions.  Finally, on 4 April 1861, King [[Pedro V of Portugal]] decreed the creation of a new ecclesiastical parish, to include Ponta, Faj\u00e3 Grande and Cuada, centred on the Church of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 da Faj\u00e3 Grande (the responsibility of the Bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], [[friar]] Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Jesus Maria, dated 20 June 1861.  The parochial church was constructed from the small chapel (which was built in 1755, and blessed on 24 May 1757); the new temple was blessed on 1 August 1850, after three years of construction (it was finally completed in 1849). Due to further support from American emigrant Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds  da Silveira, the church was remodelled in 1880. A new church was later constructed in the area of Ponta da Faj\u00e3 (the Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo) and remained in use until 1922.

Burro, Pai dos Asnos'' (''The Testament of D. Burro, Father of the Asses''), where he skewered Florentine society. Betrayed by the slighted members of the nobility and Roman Catholic clerics, he died a pauper. But, in the 20th century, his prose and incites brought the priest new fame, for his contributions to the local poor and his support for education; \n* Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds de Fraga, a Roman Catholic priest, noted for his oratory, writings and musical abilities;\n* Jo\u00e3o Joaquim Andr\u00e9 de Freitas (Faj\u00e3 Grande, 1860 \u2014 [[Lisbon]], 22 June 1929), better known as Senator Andr\u00e9 de Freitas, he was a politician and benmerit, who began his career as a deputy within the Regenerator Party, and nominated to the post of Civil Governor of the [[Horta (district)|district of Horta]] in 1908; \n* Pedro Laureano Mendon\u00e7a da Silveira (Faj\u00e3 Grande, 5 September 1922 \u2014 Lisbon, 2003)), literary critic, historian and poet, with several public works.

The first settlers were captained by Jo\u00e3o Soares, from the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], and who settled in [[Lajedo (Lajes das Flores)|Lajedo]]. The fertile land permitted the cultivation of [[woad]], one of the most important commercial ventures in  the Azores. As the Azorean chronicler Father [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] writing in the 16th Century, indicated, that the colonists benefited from the abundance of water and easy access to the sea:\n:''\"There, about a quarter league is Faj\u00e3, called \"Big\" [referring to its name Great/Grande Faj\u00e3] which offers bread and woad on elevated land, with a few berths for [[Caravel]]s, it produces at least 50 moios [Portuguese unit of solid measure] of bread and woad, and where, also, there is shellfish and fish of all kinds, and along its cape a beach, half a league in size, where there is always a strong ocean current; and from there, another half a league, the cliffs are covered with much urzela [a lichen], and large rocks, that spawn an infinity of seafood and large crabs, and from here, there is an explosion of rocks that fall to the sea, like a guns spray, where we find [[limpet]]s and [[Cowry|cowrie shells]]; and in front of this point, which forms a bay, where many type of ships anchor, including [[Carracks]] from [[Portuguese India|India]].  In the middle of this anchorage a great river-valley falls from the cliffs to sea.\"''\n\nAlthough being populated for less than a century, Faj\u00e3 Grande was already a center of commercial activity; caravels arriving from India were likely to stopover in Faj\u00e3 Grande since it was one of the first ports to be discovered on their return.  On the port of Faj\u00e3 Grande, Father [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es]], noted the  following about its installations:\n:''\"...there is a small breakwater called Baixa  d\u2019Agoa. Continue down until you get to the port of Faj\u00e3 Grande, which  has in the middle a great mound of sand and rock called Calhau da Barra.  Within this Calhau is a large \"puddle\" called the Po\u00e7\u00e3o, which gives  refuge to ships that arrive from the sea.\"''\n\nThe fertility of the land permitted the cultivation of the lichen ''Rocella tinctoria'' ([[Roccellaceae]]), a plant sought after by many of the commercial interests in the region eager to support the dye industries of Europe. The abundance of fresh water, and port, also made Faj\u00e3 Grande an important stopover for pirates and privateers; while other communities in the archipelago lived in fear of pirates, Faj\u00e3 Grande maintained a collaborative relationship and sold consumables to local crews.\n\nIt was likely one of the most prosperous communities in the western coast, resulting in its de-annexation from the neighbouring parish of [[Lajes das Flores (parish)|Lajes das Flores]], in July 1676. To create the new parish of ''Faj\u00e3s'', the local community in Ponta da Faj\u00e3 was de-annexed from the neighbouring parish of S\u00e3o Pedro de Ponta Delgada and integrated into the new administrative and ecclesiastical division. The formal delimitation of the parish was presided by Father Domingos Nunes Pereira, and the new Faj\u00e3s parish priest Father Andr\u00e9 Alves de Mendon\u00e7a, on 12/13 July 1676.\n\nWriting around 1720, Father [[Ant\u00f3nio Cordeiro]], affirmed that the Faj\u00e3s included about 80 homes. The creation of an autonomous parish in Faj\u00e3 Grande dates back to 1855, when the administration of the District of Horta attempted to resolve the call by its residents to create a new civil parish.  The debate was finally ended by the Civil Governor, Lu\u00eds Teixeira de Sampaio, who reported on 3 April 1857, that a single parish of Faj\u00e3 Grande was desirable, owing to its distance from the community of [[Faj\u00e3zinha]] (then parish seat), the size of its community, and the problem caused by annual floodings along the Riberia Grande river, which regularly cut links annually.  Local narratives mention several instances when the Ribeira Grande impeded travel to Faj\u00e3zinha, resulting in the faithful having services at the ''Pedra da Missa'' ({{lang-en|Stone of Mass}}), an elevated point on the river bank where they gathered, prayed and then dispersed after celebrating the liturgy. Governor Sampaio also noted that American whaling and high-seas travel had brought a new importance to the village, also justifying a rethink of the existing administrative divisions.  Finally, on 4 April 1861, King [[Pedro V of Portugal]] decreed the creation of a new ecclesiastical parish, to include Ponta, Faj\u00e3 Grande and Cuada, centred on the Church of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 da Faj\u00e3 Grande (the responsibility of the Bishop of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo|Angra]], [[friar]] Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Jesus Maria, dated 20 June 1861.  The parochial church was constructed from the small chapel (which was built in 1755, and blessed on 24 May 1757); the new temple was blessed on 1 August 1850, after three years of construction (it was finally completed in 1849). Due to further support from American emigrant Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds  da Silveira, the church was remodelled in 1880. A new church was later constructed in the area of Ponta da Faj\u00e3 (the Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo) and remained in use until 1922. Similarly, on 28 September 1969, a chapel in Ponta was completed, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da F\u00e1tima.\n\nLandslides around the area of Ponta da Faj\u00e3 in 1987 resulted in the declaration of this zone as ''high risk'' resulting in the express prohibition of new buildings and future remodeling of existing homes. Further landslides around Covas, in 1991, resulted in new laws to restrict residents in the area, which was ignored by the 20 inhabitants, who have maintained existing buildings .<ref>A recent plan to remove building restrictions by the residents was not supported</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Azoren (11).jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Rocha da Faj\u00e3 Escarpment showing many of the waterfalls and cliff face, Faj\u00e3 Grande]]\n[[File:Porto e zona balnear da Faj\u00e3 Grande 3, ilha das Flores, A\u00e7ores, Arquivo de Villa Maria, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The port and swimming area of the main town]]\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe village is located in an extensive faj\u00e3 (a small area of flat fertile land at the bottom of a seaside cliff composed of volcanic and geomorphological debris) on the western coast and delimited by the Rocha da Faj\u00e3 escarpment (that extends from the northwest to southeast border) and the Ribeira Grande river along the south.<ref name=SRAM/> The escarpment is an almost sheer cliff face, approximately 600 meters in some places.

Over time, secondary industries began to occupy a greater part of the local activities (but generally hovered around 20% of activities), and primarily tourism, commerce and complementary services.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Igreja de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, 1, Faj\u00e3 Grande, ilha das Flores, Arquivo de Villa Maria, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|235px|The parochial Church of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9]]\n[[File:Ermida da Ponta da Faj\u00e3 Grande, 2, ilha das Flores, A\u00e7ores, Arquivo de Villa Maria, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|235px|The church in the locality of Ponta da Faj\u00e3, dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Carmo]]\n[[File:Capela de Santo Antonio Cuada.jpg|thumb|235px|The Chapel of Santo Ant\u00f3nio]]\n\n===Civic===\n* Site of Cuada ({{lang-pt|S\u00edtio da Cuada/Lugar da Cuada}})<ref name=\"SIPA\">{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=33609 |title=S\u00edtio da Cuada/Lugar da Cuada (IPA.00032723/PT072003010012) |publisher=SIPA \u2013 Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o para o Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Anouk |last=Costa |year=2012 |access-date=14 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001231553/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=33609 |archive-date=1 October 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n* Whalewatching lookout ({{lang-pt|Vigia da baleia}}), a cabin overlooking the cliffs of Faj\u00e3 Grande, with a panoramic view of the coast, used in the whaling industry to site pods of whales and direct whaling boats.\n\n===Religious===\n* Chapel of Santo Ant\u00f3nio, on a path within the locality of Cuada;\n* Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo ({{lang-pt|Ermida da Ponta da Faj\u00e3/Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Carmo}}), erected in 1898, in the locality of Ponta da Faj\u00e3, consisting of a single nave building with belltower;<ref>{{citation |title=A ilha das Flores: Da redescoberta \u00e0 actualidade (Subs\u00eddios para a sua Hist\u00f3ria) |first=Francisco Ant\u00f3nio Nunes Pimentel |last=Gomes |publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Lajes das Flores |year=1997 |language=Portuguese |editor=C\u00e2mara Municipal}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Walkers\u2019 Guide to Lajes old footpath - Lajes das Flores, Azores |first=Pierluigi |last=Bragaglia |publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Lajes das Flores |year=1994 |language=Portuguese |editor=C\u00e2mara Municipal}}</ref>\n* [[Church of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 (Faj\u00e3 Grande)|Church of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja Paroquial de Faj\u00e3 Grande/Igreja de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9}}), constructed in 1868, it was based on a primitive chapel dedicated to Saint Joseph, which was originally built in 1755.

Burro, Pai dos Asnos'' (''The Testament of D. Burro, Father of the Asses''), where he skewered Florentine society. Betrayed by the slighted members of the nobility and Roman Catholic clerics, he died a pauper. But, in the 20th century, his prose and incites brought the priest new fame, for his contributions to the local poor and his support for education; \n* Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds de Fraga, a Roman Catholic priest, noted for his oratory, writings and musical abilities;\n* Jo\u00e3o Joaquim Andr\u00e9 de Freitas (Faj\u00e3 Grande, 1860 \u2014 [[Lisbon]], 22 June 1929), better known as Senator Andr\u00e9 de Freitas, he was a politician and benmerit, who began his career as a deputy within the Regenerator Party, and nominated to the post of Civil Governor of the [[Horta (district)|district of Horta]] in 1908; \n* Pedro Laureano Mendon\u00e7a da Silveira (Faj\u00e3 Grande, 5 September 1922 \u2014 Lisbon, 2003)), literary critic, historian and poet, with several public works.
