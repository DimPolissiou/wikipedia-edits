Though many talents are limited in scope (called the \"spot-on-a-wall\" variety), the series focuses mainly on individuals with \"Magician\" caliber abilities (one of the criteria for serving as King of Xanth).\n\nIn addition to the human characters, Xanth is populated by [[Elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s, and other fictional beasts. Though initially introduced as obstacles to the human characters, some individuals from those groups become main characters in later books of the series.\n\nAs the series progresses, some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents. The centaurs of the primary centaur community, [[Centaur Isle]], exile any centaurs who demonstrate a magical talent (although some centaur communities are more lenient about possession of talent); however, they tolerate talents in \"lesser\" races such as humans. Goblins and harpies are shown to have the potential to possess half-talents, the complementary half existing in a member of the other species, (i.e., a goblin must team with a harpy for them to utilize their talent); the hostility between goblins and harpies proved a major obstacle to any serious effort by them to work together to develop these potential talents. Other non-human species are also known to possess talents, for example: Sesame Serpent and Claire Voyant.  Visitors from other dimensions with talents retain their talents after arriving in Xanth.\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nGeographically, modern Xanth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/gap_chasm/mapof.html|title=The Map of Xanth|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> resembles the state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major example of this is the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, [[Lake Okeechobee|Lake Ogre-Chobee]] and the [[Kissimmee River|Kiss-Mee River]]). The [[Florida Keys]] also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual [[key (lock)|key]]s. Other punning feature names include the Isle of View (\"I love you\"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The [[moon]] is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and [[honey]]ish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled [[cheese]], due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear [[fruit]] of all descriptions (pie trees and shoe trees are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the [[Man-eating tree|tangle trees]]), making travel in Xanth risky.\n\nXanth has a connection with the normal world, which is referred to as \"Mundania\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moongadget.com/xanth/index.html|title=Xanthmaker - Piers Anthony Interview - Jitterbug Fantasia|website=moongadget.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> its people are called \"Mundanes\". Although any citizen of Xanth can enter Mundania at any time through an isthmus in the northwest, Mundanes enter the isthmus in Xanth from random geographic locations and time periods throughout history. In other words, Xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world; and the timeline between Xanth and Mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards. For example, within the lifetime of a normal citizen of Xanth, an American Mundane from 2012 and an Egyptian Mundane from 3000 BC could both walk across the isthmus. However, Mundanes seem to have trouble finding Xanth on a consistent basis, making any travel to Xanth a somewhat rare occurrence. Despite these seeming difficulties, Xanth was colonized in several waves by groups of invaders and nomads from Mundania over the course of several centuries. The series ties these colonization events to actual historical events on [[Earth]], most notably the [[Punic wars]].\n\n===Adult Conspiracy===\n\nFirst mentioned in ''[[Crewel Lye]]'', the Adult Conspiracy is one of the prominent features of the Xanth world. In an interview with Moira Allen, Piers Anthony referred to the \"Adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children\" as a literary device \"parodying current societal conventions\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writing-world.com/sf/anthony.shtml|title=Master of Punmanship: An Interview with Piers Anthony|website=Writing-World.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Nearly all subsequent books contain references to the Conspiracy and its effects, particularly those novels in which the main characters are children.\n\nAt its core, the Adult Conspiracy seeks to protect [[child]]ren from knowledge that could bring them to great harm. The precise age for entering into the world of [[adults]] is age 18, corresponding to the [[age of majority]] in most places. The primary principle that inducts children into the Conspiracy is the understanding of the secret of \"[[Sexual reproduction|summoning the stork]]\". In Xanthian terms, \"summoning the stork\" literally means to put out a call to summon a stork which will deliver to the couple a child. In [[Isle of View]], it is revealed that summoning the stork will release an \"[[ellipsis]]\" (...) into the air to fly off to the stork. This is a play on the joke that all the \"adult\" things happen after a paragraph ends in an ellipsis. Most inductees actually discover the specifics of the act \"by accident\" after marriage, or under the influence of a love spring (a magical spring which causes two drinkers, not necessarily human, or even of the same species, to fall madly, and lustfully, in love with one another at first sight).\n\nOther faculties of the Adult Conspiracy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://litrpgreads.com/blog/piers-anthony-magic-xanth|title=Piers Anthony: The Magic of Xanth - LitRPG Reads|date=13 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> include:\n*[[Censorship]] of [[Profanity|foul language]] &ndash; All foul words contain the ability to cause various effects (the wilting of plants (negative), removal of curse burrs (positive), etc.). These are automatically [[Thomas Bowdler|bleeped]] when said in the presence of someone who has yet to be inducted.\n*Visual access to underwear &ndash; Because [[underwear]] is so closely tied to [[human sexuality|sexuality]] (even more so than nudity in Xanth), men become automatically \"freaked out\" when they view panties. This is made a common joke, most prominently in the novel ''[[The Color of Her Panties]]'', and is often used by women to gain advantage over men. Panties only carry their effects when worn, but because of their nature, they are forbidden to be shown to children.\n*Inability to have childish fun &ndash; Children believe that once they join the Adult Conspiracy, they will no longer have pillow fights, eat sweets and drink \"tsoda popka\" ([[Soft drink|soda pop]]), or want to have [[fun]]. While this belief is exaggerated, the entry to the Conspiracy does cause the couple to lose their bed monster, inadvertently creating the appearance of losing all childhood spirit under the responsibility of Adulthood.\n\nIt is important to note that there have been occasions when children gained access to the Adult Conspiracy prematurely. Jenny Elf, Che Centaur, and Gwenny Goblin had to be given access to the Adult Conspiracy when Gwenny received a pair of [[contact lens]]es that corrected her poor [[eyesight]] while giving her the ability to see others' [[dream]]s (some of which could contain Conspiracy material). In one rare instance, a little girl was born with the magic talent of immunity to the magical censorship of Adult Conspiracy, causing her family much distress. This was remedied with magician Sherlock's talent of reversal and a vial of [[lethe]] water which erased her [[memory]].\n\n===Mundania===\nWhenever Xanth characters visit the nonmagical land outside of Xanth, called Mundania, its natives (Mundanes) speak what sounds like gibberish to the Xanth characters. The gibberish can be translated by a simple replacement [[cipher]], depending on the Mundane language being spoken. Often the language is a simple shift in the alphabet, a letter or two forwards or backwards (see [[Caesar cipher]]).\n\n=== Curse fiends ===\n\nCurse fiends, who call themselves \"curse friends,\" are known for their talent to throw curses at their enemies. They are believed to be the primary cause of several different settings in Xanth: 1) the land of Air, 2) the land of Earth, 3) the land of Fire, 4) the land of Water (also called the Water Wing), and 5) the Void. The story about how these regions were created is described in ''[[Demons Don't Dream]]''.\n\nThe curse fiends in the present day Xanth stay close to their own community where they put on plays. Because of this, they are widely known for their acting skills.\n\n==Related works==\n*''Encyclopedia of Xanth'' (1987, by [[Jody Lynn Nye]]) a Crossroads Adventure role-playing game book\n*''Ghost of a Chance'' (1988, by Jody Lynn Nye) a Crossroads Adventure role-playing game book\n*''Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth'' (1989, with Jody Lynn Nye)\n* \"Xanth\" Board Game (1991, created by Mayfair Games, a board game for 1-6 players set in the Xanth Universe)\n*''[[Companions of Xanth]]'' (a 1993 [[video game]] described in and following the plot of ''Demons Don't Dream'')\n*''[[Letters to Jenny]]'' (1993, nonfiction)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.hipiers.com/bibliography.html Piers Anthony's Bibliography List]\n*''Ghost of a Chance'' ({{ISBN|0-8125-6450-2}}) (1988) by Jody Lyn Nye (A Crossroads Adventure in the World of Piers Anthony's Xanth)\n*''Bio of an Ogre'' ({{ISBN|0-441-06225-3}}) (1988) by Piers Anthony (Xanth: Part Five: Number 4 p.&nbsp;213)\n{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hipiers.com/xanth.html Xanth on Hipiers.com]\n* The [http://us.macmillan.com/series/Xanth Xanth] series page at [[Tor Books]]\n*{{isfdb series|id=581|title=Xanth}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050429183315/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/12/07/xanth/index.html ''I was a captive of Xanth''] a review of the long-lived series from [[Salon.com|Salon]] (December 7, 2000)\n*[http://www.piers-anthony.com/xanthtimeline.html The timeline of Xanth]\n\n{{Xanth}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Xanth| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional countries]]\n[[Category:Zombies and revenants in popular culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox fictional location\n| name         = Xanth\n| image        =\n| image_size   =\n| alt          =\n| caption      =\n| source       = ''The Magic of Xanth''\n| alt_name     =\n| first        = ''[[A Spell for Chameleon]]''\n| last         = ''[[Fire Sail]]''\n| creator      = [[Piers Anthony]]\n| genre        = fantasy\n| type         = [[fantasy world]]\n| located_in   =\n| ruler        = [[Magician Trent]]\n| locations    =\n| ethnic_group =\n| races        = [[Elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s\n| characters   =\n| population   =\n}}\n'''Xanth''' ({{IPAc-en|'|z|\u00e6|n|\u03b8}} {{respell|ZANTH|'}}) is a [[fantasy world]] created by author [[Piers Anthony]] for his ''Xanth'' series of novels, also known as ''The Magic of Xanth''.

Though many talents are limited in scope (called the \"spot-on-a-wall\" variety), the series focuses mainly on individuals with \"Magician\" caliber abilities (one of the criteria for serving as King of Xanth).\n\nIn addition to the human characters, Xanth is populated by [[Elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s, and other fictional beasts. Though initially introduced as obstacles to the human characters, some individuals from those groups become main characters in later books of the series.\n\nAs the series progresses, some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents. The centaurs of the primary centaur community, [[Centaur Isle]], exile any centaurs who demonstrate a magical talent (although some centaur communities are more lenient about possession of talent); however, they tolerate talents in \"lesser\" races such as humans. Goblins and harpies are shown to have the potential to possess half-talents, the complementary half existing in a member of the other species, (i.e., a goblin must team with a harpy for them to utilize their talent); the hostility between goblins and harpies proved a major obstacle to any serious effort by them to work together to develop these potential talents. Other non-human species are also known to possess talents, for example: Sesame Serpent and Claire Voyant.  Visitors from other dimensions with talents retain their talents after arriving in Xanth.\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nGeographically, modern Xanth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/gap_chasm/mapof.html|title=The Map of Xanth|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> resembles the state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major example of this is the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, [[Lake Okeechobee|Lake Ogre-Chobee]] and the [[Kissimmee River|Kiss-Mee River]]). The [[Florida Keys]] also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual [[key (lock)|key]]s. Other punning feature names include the Isle of View (\"I love you\"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The [[moon]] is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and [[honey]]ish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled [[cheese]], due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear [[fruit]] of all descriptions (pie trees and shoe trees are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the [[Man-eating tree|tangle trees]]), making travel in Xanth risky.\n\nXanth has a connection with the normal world, which is referred to as \"Mundania\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moongadget.com/xanth/index.html|title=Xanthmaker - Piers Anthony Interview - Jitterbug Fantasia|website=moongadget.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> its people are called \"Mundanes\". Although any citizen of Xanth can enter Mundania at any time through an isthmus in the northwest, Mundanes enter the isthmus in Xanth from random geographic locations and time periods throughout history. In other words, Xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world; and the timeline between Xanth and Mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards. For example, within the lifetime of a normal citizen of Xanth, an American Mundane from 2012 and an Egyptian Mundane from 3,000 B.C. could both walk across the isthmus. However, Mundanes seem to have trouble finding Xanth on a consistent basis, making any travel to Xanth a somewhat rare occurrence. Despite these seeming difficulties, Xanth was colonized in several waves by groups of invaders and nomads from Mundania over the course of several centuries. The series ties these colonization events to actual historical events on [[Earth]], most notably the [[Punic wars]].\n\n===Adult Conspiracy===\n\nFirst mentioned in ''[[Crewel Lye]]'', the Adult Conspiracy is one of the prominent features of the Xanth world. In an interview with Moira Allen, Piers Anthony referred to the \"Adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children\" as a literary device \"parodying current societal conventions\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writing-world.com/sf/anthony.shtml|title=Master of Punmanship: An Interview with Piers Anthony|website=Writing-World.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Nearly all subsequent books contain references to the Conspiracy and its effects, particularly those novels in which the main characters are children.\n\nAt its core, the Adult Conspiracy seeks to protect [[child]]ren from knowledge that could bring them to great harm.
