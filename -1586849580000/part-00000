It is a well-known [[winegrowing]] centre. The town is a state-recognized health resort (''Erholungsort''), seat of the [[Bernkastel-Kues (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Bernkastel-Kues]] and birthplace of one of the most famous German [[polymath]]s, the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] churchman and philosopher [[Nikolaus von Kues]] (Cusanus).\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nBernkastel-Kues lies in the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] valley, roughly {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Trier]]. The greatest elevation is the ''Olymp'' (415&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]), and the lowest point (107&nbsp;m above sea level) lies on the Moselle's banks. The municipal area totals 23&nbsp;657&nbsp;101&nbsp;m\u00b2, of which 7&nbsp;815&nbsp;899&nbsp;m\u00b2 is used for [[agriculture]], thereby making Bernkastel-Kues one of the Middle Moselle's biggest towns by land area.\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\nClockwise from the north, these are [[Graach an der Mosel|Graach]], [[Longkamp]], [[Monzelfeld]], [[Veldenz]], [[M\u00fclheim an der Mosel|M\u00fclheim]], [[Lieser (Mosel)|Lieser]], [[Maring-Noviand]], [[Platten, Germany|Platten]] and [[Zeltingen-Rachtig]].\n\n===Constituent communities===\nBernkastel-Kues is subdivided into the four ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'' of Andel, Bernkastel, Kues and Wehlen. The former two lie on the Moselle's right bank, while the latter two are on the left. All together, 7,794 people live in all four centres (3,696 men, 4,098 women), of whom 268 \u2013 or 3.44% \u2013 are foreigners.\n\n====Population structure====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"90px\" bgcolor=#FFFFFF| [[Stadtteil]]<br/><small>(''as at 1/2006'')</small>\n! bgcolor=#FFFFFF| Inhabitants\n! bgcolor=#FFFFFF| Male\n! bgcolor=#FFFFFF| Female\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Andel || 788 || 378 || 410\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Bernkastel || 1087 || 539 || 548\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Kues || 4603 || 2121 || 2482\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Wehlen || 1262 || 658 || 604\n|}\n\n===Climate===\nThe town lies in a transitional zone between [[Oceanic climate|temperate oceanic climate]] and [[continental climate]]. The barrier formed by the [[Eifel]] shields Bernkastel-Kues from west winds, putting it in a [[rain shadow]] and sometimes subjecting it to a [[Foehn wind|f\u00f6hn]] effect.\n\nYearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in Bernkastel-Kues amounts to {{convert|706|mm|1|abbr=on}}, falling into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 41% of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Weather Service's]] weather stations lower figures are recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in August. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies hardly at all, being evenly spread throughout the year. At only 22% of the weather stations are lower seasonal [[:File:BERNKASTEL nieder.svg|swings]] recorded.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation (3000 BC) was discovered by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] in Kues. About AD 370, [[Ausonius|Decimus Magnus Ausonius]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet and teacher at the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] court, wrote his poem ''Mosella''. Adalbero von Luxemburg (d. 1036 or 1037), Provost of the Trier Monastery of St. Paulin, became Lord of Bernkastel in the early 11th century.\n\nIn the first half of the 11th century, Bernkastel had its first documentary mention.\n\nAt the turn of the 8th century, a geographer described a place called ''Princastellum''. This is said to be evidence of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[castellum]] in the 4th century near today's Landshut castle ruin. Pointing to this are, among other things, fittings and finds of ceramic and iron underneath the castle.\n\nThe 12th-century form of the name, ''Beronis castellum'', was a learned re-Latinization, which was related to Adalbero von Luxemburg. Work was begun on the third castle building under the lordship of Archbishop of Trier Heinrich II of Finstingen.\n\nOn 29 May 1291, King [[Rudolph I of Germany]] granted ''Berrincastel'' town rights. The castle, Burg Landshut, which was built at that time, was given this name only in the 16th century. In 1332, the town rights were reaffirmed by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian's]] ''Sammelprivileg'' (a kind of omnibus decree that dealt with many rights and privileges). Under the terms of the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], [[Bohemond II (Archbishop of Trier)|Bohemond II]] became Elector. According to legend, he was brought back to health from a serious illness by a glass of wine, giving rise to the legend of the ''Berncastler Doctor'' winery.\n\nIn 1401, [[Nikolaus von Kues]], also known by his [[Latin]]ized name Nicolaus Cusanus, was born in Moselle shipowner Henne Cryfftz's house, which is well preserved and can be visited. In 1451, the ''St.-Nikolaus-Hospital'', a hospital for the poor, was built.\n\nIn 1505, in an [[Prince-elector|Electoral]] edict from Jakob II, the name ''Landshut'' for the archiepiscopal castle crops up for the first time. Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] spent a night in Bernkastel in 1512 on the way to the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] at Trier.\n\nThe [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] raged in Bernkastel in 1627, and in Kues in 1641. In 1692, Castle Landshut fell victim to fire and since then it has been a ruin.\n\nFrom 1794 to 1814, Bernkastel was a cantonal ''[[chef-lieu]]'' under [[France|French]] rule. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Bernkastel and Kues were annexed to the Kingdom of [[Prussia]]. In 1821 Bernkastel became a district seat. In 1848, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution]] came to Bernkastel as it had to many of the then politically disunited German lands: The black-red-gold flag was hoisted at the town hall and a [[militia]] was formed.\n\nThe first road bridge between Bernkastel and Kues was built between 1872 and 1874, as was the first [[railway]] link in 1882 and 1883. In 1891, Bernkastel marked its 600-year jubilee as a town.\n\nThe town in its current form came into being on 1 April 1905 through the merger of the town of Bernkastel with the winemaking village of Kues across the river. In 1926 there arose great unrest among winemakers along the Moselle, and the financial office in Bernkastel and the customs office in Kues were stormed.\n\nOn [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938), there were great riots against [[Jew]]ish inhabitants, and the [[synagogue]] was destroyed.\n\nIn 1946, the first democratic elections after the [[Second World War]] were held. Hans Weber became mayor.\n\nIn 1970, Andel and Wehlen were amalgamated with the town. With administrative reform in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Bernkastel-Kues (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Bernkastel-Kues]] was formed through the merger of the ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|\u00c4mter]]'' of Bernkastel-Land, Lieser, M\u00fclheim, Zeltingen and the town of Bernkastel-Kues.\n\nIn 1997, the Burgbergtunnel, a traffic bypass, had its festive opening.\n\nBernkastel-Kues was the host town for the annual Intercamp Camporee for the year 2008.  Scouting councils from the [[United States|USA]], [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], Germany, [[France]], and many other [[Europe]]an countries attended the event on May 9\u201311.\n\nIn 2000 began the partnership between Bernkastel-Kues and Karlovy Vary in the [[Czech Republic]]. In 2005, the town celebrated the centenary of the merger of Bernkastel and Kues, and the municipality became a \u201cclimatic health resort\u201d (''Heilklimatischer Kurort'').\n\n==Politics==\n===Town council===\nThe council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by [[proportional representation]] at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>[http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/2310100800.html Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Stadtrat]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" font-size:92%;\" \n|- style=\"background-color:#ABCDEF\"\n| || [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || [[Alliance '90/The Greens|GR\u00dcNE]] || UBU (Unabh\u00e4ngige B\u00fcrgerunion) || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 3 || 9 || 4 || 3 || 3 || 22 seats\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2004 || 3 || 11 || 3 || 3 || 2 || 22 seats\n|}\n\n===Mayors===\nThe honorary mayor is Wolfgang Port (CDU). He was first elected in 2000 and last re\u00eblected in 2009 with 73.6% of the vote, but without any opponents.\n\nPort's predecessor, Helmut Gestrich, was mayor beginning in 1994 and was re\u00eblected in 1999, but he resigned the mayoralty on 22 November 2000 after having been linked to the so-called Doerfert Affair (a corruption scandal; its namesake, Hans-Joachim Doerfert, was sentenced to seven years and three months for fraud and breach of trust, although he only served five years).<ref>[http://www.volksfreund.de/totallokal/mosel/aktuell/Heute-in-der-Mosel-Zeitung-Bernkastel-Kues;art671,2093382 Pr\u00e4gende Pers\u00f6nlichkeit verloren] volksfreund.de, 30.

The bear is the town's armorial bearing, and is [[Canting arms|canting]] (\u201cbear\u201d is ''B\u00e4r'' in [[German language|German]]). The crayfish, also canting, as the blazon calls it a ''Krebs'' (a word applied to any of a number of [[crustacean]] creatures), stands for [[Nikolaus von Kues]], whose family name was Cryfftz (the same as ''Krebs'' in [[German language|High German]]).<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/bernkast.htm Entry at ''Heraldry of the World'']</ref> There are only two other towns in Germany whose arms bear a crustacean charge, namely [[Bad Wurzach]] in the [[Allg\u00e4u]] and [[Cottbus]].\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n[[File:Hospital Cues.

Around the ''St. Michaelsbrunnen'' (\u201c[[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael\u2019s]] Fountain\u201d) from 1606 gathers a row of well-preserved buildings and also the [[Renaissance]] Town Hall from 1608. The [[Graach Gate]] is an often visited tourist attraction. Above the constituent community of Bernkastel lie the Castle Landshut ruins, a former summer residence of the Archbishops of Trier that was destroyed by fire on 8 January 1692. It today serves as a popular lookout point over the Moselle valley. Also worth seeing is the only town gate that is still standing, the ''Graacher Tor'' (\u201c[[Graach Gate]]\u201d).\n\nThe town furthermore has several squares at its disposal; beyond the mediaeval marketplace are the ''Platz am B\u00e4renbrunnen'' (\u201cSquare at the Bear\u2019s Fountain\u201d) and the ''Karlsbader Platz'' (\u201cKarlovy Vary Square\u201d \u2013 named after the partner town, which is called ''Karlsbad'' in [[German language|German]]) opened in July 2005. The ''Doctorbrunnen'' (\u201cDoctor Fountain\u201d) depicts scenes of the old legend about a local wine, the famous \"Bernkasteler Doctor\". Another well-known point of interest is the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] ''St. Nikolaus-Hospital'' (''[[Cusanusstift]]''), an Electoral complex of [[Nikolaus von Kues]]. The institution's library has an outstanding scientific range of works. It is also well known for its chapel, where the heart of the great philosopher, cardinal and polymath [[Nikolaus von Kues]] (Cusanus) is buried. Near the outlying centre of Wehlen lies the former Machern Monastery in whose rooms are now found a winery, a house brewery and a restaurant.\n\n===Regular events===\n* ''MoselMusikFestival'' (May to October)\n* ''Weinfest der Mittelmosel'' (\u201cWine Festival of the Middle Moselle\u201d, each year on the first weekend in September) \u2013 with, among other things, a parade and fireworks\n* Christmas market in the mediaeval town.

With the opening of the Burgbergtunnel (550&nbsp;m), heavy traffic in the constituent community of Bernkastel was alleviated. Also, two bridges are found in town, one of which is the only [[suspension bridge]] across the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]]. Both were renovated in the 1990s. Public transport is integrated into the ''Verkehrsverbund Region Trier'' (VRT), whose fares therefore apply.\n\n====Rail====\nUntil 31 December 1962, the narrow gauge ''Moseltalbahn'', also called the ''Saufb\u00e4hnchen'', ran through Bernkastel-Kues. The [[railway station]] building stands at the water's edge in the constituent community of Bernkastel (right bank). Furthermore, there was a [[Deutsche Bahn]] terminal station in the constituent community of Kues (left bank) whence a further railway track, the [[Wengerohr\u2013Bernkastel-Kues|Wengerohr\u2013Bernkastel-Kues line]], linked the town with Wittlich and the [[Moselle Railway|Moselle line]] ([[Cannons Railway]]). Both [[railway]]s are disused and the tracks have been torn up. The slate-block railway station building, built \u201cMoselle-style\u201d in the early 20th century by ''[[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Reichsbahn]]'' building director Franz Schenk, has likewise been preserved. An adjoining goods building was restored and is now used as a multifunctional building (''G\u00fcterhalle''). In what was once the track area there was at first an unsecured carpark. Now here is the ''Forum Alter Bahnhof'', a municipal service centre with an underground parking garage. The track itself was first converted as far as [[Lieser (Mosel)|Lieser]] into the ''Mosel-Radweg'' (cycling trail), and then later into the ''Maare-Mosel-Radweg'' through Wittlich to [[Daun, Germany|Daun]] in the [[Eifel]].\n\n====Water====\nBernkastel-Kues is a stop on [[Rhine]]-[[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] cruises.

It is a well-known [[winegrowing]] centre. The town is a state-recognized health resort (''Erholungsort''), seat of the [[Bernkastel-Kues (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Bernkastel-Kues]] and birthplace of one of the most famous German [[polymath]]s, the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] churchman and philosopher [[Nikolaus von Kues]] (Cusanus).\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nBernkastel-Kues lies in the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] valley, roughly {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Trier]]. The greatest elevation is the ''Olymp'' (415&nbsp;m above [[sea level]]), and the lowest point (107&nbsp;m above sea level) lies on the Moselle's banks. The municipal area totals 23&nbsp;657&nbsp;101&nbsp;m\u00b2, of which 7&nbsp;815&nbsp;899&nbsp;m\u00b2 is used for [[agriculture]], thereby making Bernkastel-Kues one of the Middle Moselle's biggest towns by land area.\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\nClockwise from the north, these are [[Graach an der Mosel|Graach]], [[Longkamp]], [[Monzelfeld]], [[Veldenz]], [[M\u00fclheim an der Mosel|M\u00fclheim]], [[Lieser (Mosel)|Lieser]], [[Maring-Noviand]], [[Platten, Germany|Platten]] and [[Zeltingen-Rachtig]].\n\n===Constituent communities===\nBernkastel-Kues is subdivided into the four ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'' of Andel, Bernkastel, Kues and Wehlen. The former two lie on the Moselle's right bank, while the latter two are on the left. All together, 7,794 people live in all four centres (3,696 men, 4,098 women), of whom 268 \u2013 or 3.44% \u2013 are foreigners.\n\n====Population structure====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"90px\" bgcolor=#FFFFFF| [[Stadtteil]]<br/><small>(''as at 1/2006'')</small>\n! bgcolor=#FFFFFF| Inhabitants\n! bgcolor=#FFFFFF| Male\n! bgcolor=#FFFFFF| Female\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Andel || 788 || 378 || 410\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Bernkastel || 1087 || 539 || 548\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Kues || 4603 || 2121 || 2482\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Wehlen || 1262 || 658 || 604\n|}\n\n===Climate===\nThe town lies in a transitional zone between [[Oceanic climate|temperate oceanic climate]] and [[continental climate]]. The barrier formed by the [[Eifel]] shields Bernkastel-Kues from west winds, putting it in a [[rain shadow]] and sometimes subjecting it to a [[Foehn wind|f\u00f6hn]] effect.\n\nYearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in Bernkastel-Kues amounts to {{convert|706|mm|1|abbr=on}}, falling into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 41% of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Weather Service's]] weather stations lower figures are recorded. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in August. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies hardly at all, being evenly spread throughout the year. At only 22% of the weather stations are lower seasonal [[:File:BERNKASTEL nieder.svg|swings]] recorded.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation (3000 BC) was discovered by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] in Kues. About AD 370, [[Ausonius|Decimus Magnus Ausonius]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet and teacher at the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] court, wrote his poem ''Mosella''. Adalbero von Luxemburg (d. 1036 or 1037), Provost of the Trier Monastery of St. Paulin, became Lord of Bernkastel in the early 11th century.\n\nIn the first half of the 11th century, Bernkastel had its first documentary mention.\n\nAt the turn of the 8th century, a geographer described a place called ''Princastellum''. This is said to be evidence of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[castellum]] in the 4th century near today's Landshut castle ruin. Pointing to this are, among other things, fittings and finds of ceramic and iron underneath the castle.\n\nThe 12th-century form of the name, ''Beronis castellum'', was a learned re-Latinization, which was related to Adalbero von Luxemburg. Work was begun on the third castle building under the lordship of Archbishop of Trier Heinrich II of Finstingen.\n\nOn 29 May 1291, King [[Rudolph I of Germany]] granted ''Berrincastel'' town rights. The castle, Burg Landshut, which was built at that time, was given this name only in the 16th century. In 1332, the town rights were reaffirmed by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian's]] ''Sammelprivileg'' (a kind of omnibus decree that dealt with many rights and privileges). Under the terms of the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], [[Bohemond II (Archbishop of Trier)|Bohemond II]] became Elector. According to legend, he was brought back to health from a serious illness by a glass of wine, giving rise to the legend of the ''Berncastler Doctor'' winery.\n\nIn 1401, [[Nikolaus von Kues]], also known by his [[Latin]]ized name Nicolaus Cusanus, was born in Moselle shipowner Henne Cryfftz's house, which is well preserved and can be visited. In 1451, the ''St.-Nikolaus-Hospital'', a hospital for the poor, was built.\n\nIn 1505, in an [[Prince-elector|Electoral]] edict from Jakob II, the name ''Landshut'' for the archiepiscopal castle crops up for the first time. Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] spent a night in Bernkastel in 1512 on the way to the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] at Trier.\n\nThe [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] raged in Bernkastel in 1627, and in Kues in 1641. In 1692, Castle Landshut fell victim to fire and since then it has been a ruin.\n\nFrom 1794 to 1814, Bernkastel was a cantonal ''[[chef-lieu]]'' under [[France|French]] rule. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Bernkastel and Kues were annexed to the Kingdom of [[Prussia]]. In 1821 Bernkastel became a district seat. In 1848, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution]] came to Bernkastel as it had to many of the then politically disunited German lands: The black-red-gold flag was hoisted at the town hall and a [[militia]] was formed.\n\nThe first road bridge between Bernkastel and Kues was built between 1872 and 1874, as was the first [[railway]] link in 1882 and 1883. In 1891, Bernkastel marked its 600-year jubilee as a town.\n\nThe town in its current form came into being on 1 April 1905 through the merger of the town of Bernkastel with the winemaking village of Kues across the river. In 1926 there arose great unrest among winemakers along the Moselle, and the financial office in Bernkastel and the customs office in Kues were stormed.\n\nOn [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938), there were great riots against [[Jew]]ish inhabitants, and the [[synagogue]] was destroyed.\n\nIn 1946, the first democratic elections after the [[Second World War]] were held. Hans Weber became mayor.\n\nIn 1970, Andel and Wehlen were amalgamated with the town. With administrative reform in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Bernkastel-Kues (Verbandsgemeinde)|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Bernkastel-Kues]] was formed through the merger of the ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|\u00c4mter]]'' of Bernkastel-Land, Lieser, M\u00fclheim, Zeltingen and the town of Bernkastel-Kues.\n\nIn 1997, the Burgbergtunnel, a traffic bypass, had its festive opening.\n\nBernkastel-Kues was the host town for the annual Intercamp Camporee for the year 2008.  Scouting councils from the [[United States|USA]], [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], Germany, [[France]], and many other [[Europe]]an countries attended the event on May 9\u201311.\n\nIn 2000 began the partnership between Bernkastel-Kues and Karlovy Vary in the [[Czech Republic]]. In 2005, the town celebrated the centenary of the merger of Bernkastel and Kues, and the municipality became a \u201cclimatic health resort\u201d (''Heilklimatischer Kurort'').\n\n==Politics==\n===Town council===\nThe council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by [[proportional representation]] at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>[http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/2310100800.html Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Stadtrat]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" font-size:92%;\" \n|- style=\"background-color:#ABCDEF\"\n| || [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || [[Alliance '90/The Greens|GR\u00dcNE]] || UBU (Unabh\u00e4ngige B\u00fcrgerunion) || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 3 || 9 || 4 || 3 || 3 || 22 seats\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2004 || 3 || 11 || 3 || 3 || 2 || 22 seats\n|}\n\n===Mayors===\nThe honorary mayor is Wolfgang Port (CDU). He was first elected in 2000 and last re\u00eblected in 2009 with 73.6% of the vote, but without any opponents.\n\nPort's predecessor, Helmut Gestrich, was mayor beginning in 1994 and was re\u00eblected in 1999, but he resigned the mayoralty on 22 November 2000 after having been linked to the so-called Doerfert Affair (a corruption scandal; its namesake, Hans-Joachim Doerfert, was sentenced to seven years and three months for fraud and breach of trust, although he only served five years).<ref>[http://www.volksfreund.de/totallokal/mosel/aktuell/Heute-in-der-Mosel-Zeitung-Bernkastel-Kues;art671,2093382 Pr\u00e4gende Pers\u00f6nlichkeit verloren] volksfreund.de, 30.

The bear is the town's armorial bearing, and is [[Canting arms|canting]] (\u201cbear\u201d is ''B\u00e4r'' in [[German language|German]]). The crayfish, also canting, as the blazon calls it a ''Krebs'' (a word applied to any of a number of [[crustacean]] creatures), stands for [[Nikolaus von Kues]], whose family name was Cryfftz (the same as ''Krebs'' in [[German language|High German]]).<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/bernkast.htm Entry at ''Heraldry of the World'']</ref> There are only two other towns in Germany whose arms bear a crustacean charge, namely [[Bad Wurzach]] in the [[Allg\u00e4u]] and [[Cottbus]].\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n[[File:Hospital Cues.

Around the ''St. Michaelsbrunnen'' (\u201c[[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael\u2019s]] Fountain\u201d) from 1606 gathers a row of well-preserved buildings and also the [[Renaissance]] Town Hall from 1608. The [[Graach Gate]] is an often visited tourist attraction. Above the constituent community of Bernkastel lie the Castle Landshut ruins, a former summer residence of the Archbishops of Trier that was destroyed by fire on 8 January 1692. It today serves as a popular lookout point over the Moselle valley. Also worth seeing is the only town gate that is still standing, the ''Graacher Tor'' (\u201c[[Graach Gate]]\u201d).\n\nThe town furthermore has several squares at its disposal; beyond the mediaeval marketplace are the ''Platz am B\u00e4renbrunnen'' (\u201cSquare at the Bear\u2019s Fountain\u201d) and the ''Karlsbader Platz'' (\u201cKarlovy Vary Square\u201d \u2013 named after the partner town, which is called ''Karlsbad'' in [[German language|German]]) opened in July 2005. The ''Doctorbrunnen'' (\u201cDoctor Fountain\u201d) depicts scenes of the old legend about a local wine, the famous \"Bernkasteler Doctor\". Another well-known point of interest is the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] ''St. Nikolaus-Hospital'' (''[[Cusanusstift]]''), an Electoral complex of [[Nikolaus von Kues]]. The institution's library has an outstanding scientific range of works. It is also well known for its chapel, where the heart of the great philosopher, cardinal and polymath [[Nikolaus von Kues]] (Cusanus) is buried. Near the outlying centre of Wehlen lies the former Machern Monastery in whose rooms are now found a winery, a house brewery and a restaurant.\n\n===Regular events===\n* ''MoselMusikFestival'' (May to October)\n* ''Weinfest der Mittelmosel'' (\u201cWine Festival of the Middle Moselle\u201d, each year on the first weekend in September) \u2013 with, among other things, a parade and fireworks\n* Christmas market in the mediaeval town.

With the opening of the Burgbergtunnel (550&nbsp;m), heavy traffic in the constituent community of Bernkastel was alleviated. Also, two bridges are found in town, one of which is the only [[suspension bridge]] across the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]]. Both were renovated in the 1990s. Public transport is integrated into the ''Verkehrsverbund Region Trier'' (VRT), whose fares therefore apply.\n\n====Rail====\nUntil 31 December 1962, the narrow gauge ''Moseltalbahn'', also called the ''Saufb\u00e4hnchen'', ran through Bernkastel-Kues. The [[railway station]] building stands at the water's edge in the constituent community of Bernkastel (right bank). Furthermore, there was a [[Deutsche Bahn]] terminal station in the constituent community of Kues (left bank) whence a further railway track, the [[Wengerohr\u2013Bernkastel-Kues|Wengerohr\u2013Bernkastel-Kues line]], linked the town with Wittlich and the [[Moselle Railway|Moselle line]] ([[Cannons Railway]]). Both [[railway]]s are disused and the tracks have been torn up. The slate-block railway station building, built \u201cMoselle-style\u201d in the early 20th century by ''[[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Reichsbahn]]'' building director Franz Schenk, has likewise been preserved. An adjoining goods building was restored and is now used as a multifunctional building (''G\u00fcterhalle''). In what was once the track area there was at first an unsecured carpark. Now here is the ''Forum Alter Bahnhof'', a municipal service centre with an underground parking garage. The track itself was first converted as far as [[Lieser (Mosel)|Lieser]] into the ''Mosel-Radweg'' (cycling trail), and then later into the ''Maare-Mosel-Radweg'' through Wittlich to [[Daun, Germany|Daun]] in the [[Eifel]].\n\n====Water====\nBernkastel-Kues is a stop on [[Rhine]]-[[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] cruises.

Because these waters are able to contain a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, they have helped slow the rise in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations]], thus slowing some aspects of [[climate change]].\n\nClimate change could have different effects on ice melt and brine rejection. Previous studies have suggested that as [[ice cover]] thins, it will become a weaker insulator, resulting in larger ice production during the autumn and winter.<ref name=\":0\">Holland M.M., [[Cecilia Bitz|Bitz C.]], Tremblay B. (2006), Future abrupt reductions in the summer Arctic sea ice. Geophys. Res. Letters. 33, 1-5.</ref> The consequent increase in winter brine rejection will drive ocean ventilation, and strengthen the inflow of warm [[Atlantic]] waters. Studies of the last [[glacial maximum]] (LGM) have indicated that a drastic reduction in the production of sea ice and thus reduction of brine rejection, would result in the weakening of the stratification in the global deep oceans and in CO<sub>2</sub> release into the shallow oceans and the atmosphere, triggering global deglaciation.<ref name=\"life_hung\">Thatje S., Hillenbrand C.D., Mackensen A., Larter R.

The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with [[mandolin orchestra]]s, so called ''Estudiantinas'' or in Germany ''Zupforchestern'', appearing in many cities. Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family, local traditions appeared outside Europe in the Americas and in Japan. Travelling mandolin virtuosi like [[Giuseppe Pettine]], [[Raffaele Calace]] and [[Silvio Ranieri]] contributed to the mandolin becoming a \"fad\" instrument in the early 20th century.<ref name=academicpaper/> This \"mandolin craze\" was fading by the 1930s, but just as this practice was falling into disuse, the mandolin found a new niche in American [[country music|country]], [[old-time music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]]. More recently, the [[Baroque]] and [[Classical music|Classical]] mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in [[Early music]], with media attention to classical players such as Israeli [[Avi Avital]], Italian [[Carlo Aonzo]] and American [[Joseph Brent]].\n\nSee also: [[History of the mandolin]]\n\n== Algeria ==\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | image1 = Karim tizouiar.jpg\n | width1 = 176\n | alt1 = Karim Tizouiar with a mandole\n | caption1 = Karim Tizouiar with a mandole.

Mandolins and larger members of the mandolin family were used in orchestras, including orchestras playing native Algerian music. With the decline of the mandolin worldwide, the mandolin became less common until by the 21st century it was rare. However, mandolins and [[mandolas]] are still occasionally made by luthiers. The major mandolin-family instrument in use today is the mandocello-sized [[mondol]] or \"mandole\" (French word for mandola applied to the new instrument). The flatback instrument was the result of a corroboration between an Italian luthier and an Algerian musician and was used initially for [[Chaabi]]. It has since spread to other music forms. Prominent players today include [[Mohamed Rouane]], [[Takfarinas]], Mohamed Abdennour (P'tit Moh), [[Abderrahmane Abdelli]] and Kader Fahem. Past players include [[El Hadj M'Hamed El Anka]], [[Boudjemaa El Ankis]], [[El Hachemi Guerouabi]], [[Amar Ezzahi]], [[Cheikh El Hasnaoui]], and [[Loun\u00e8s Matoub]]. The mondol received some international attention on the movie ''El Gusto'' a featuring the reunion of some chaabi players (including a mondol player) years after the turmoil in Algeria came out in the 2010s.\n\n== Australia ==\n:[[:Category:Australian mandolinists|See Australian mandolinists]]\nThe earliest references to the mandolin in [[Australia]] come from [[Phil Skinner]] (1903\u20131991). In his article \"Recollections\"<ref name=\"Skinner\">Recollections - by Phil Skinner.  FIGA magazine January February 1981 (Fretted Instrument Guild of America)</ref> he mentions a [[Walter Stent]], who was \"active in the early part of the century and organised possibly the first Mandolin Orchestra in [[Sydney]].\"\n\nPhil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia, and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community. He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning [[music]] at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the [[banjo]]. Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18, until the [[Great Depression]] forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments. Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra, the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fame.asn.au/sydney/history.htm|title=The Sydney Mandolin Orchestra - history|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=21 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227174540/http://www.fame.asn.au/sydney/history.htm|archivedate=27 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sydney Mandolins (Artistic Director: Adrian Hooper) have contributed greatly to the repertoire through commissioning over 200 works by Australian and International composers. Most of these works have been released on Compact Disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the ABC and MBS networks. One of their members, mandolin virtuoso Paul Hooper, has had a number of Concertos written for him by composers such as Eric Gross. He has performed and recorded these works with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. As well, Paul Hooper has had many solo works dedicated to him by Australian composers e.g., Caroline Szeto, Larry Sitsky and Michael Smetanin, as well as other works by Robert Allworth and Betty Beath.<!--I trimmed some detail from this that was too off point for the article.-->\n\nIn January 1979, the [[Federation of Australian Mandolin Ensembles]] (FAME) Inc. formed. [[Bruce Morey]] from [[Melbourne]] is the first FAME President. An Australian Mandolin Orchestra toured [[Germany]] in May 1980.\n\nAustralian popular groups such as [[My Friend The Chocolate Cake]] use the mandolin extensively. [[The McClymonts]] also use the mandolin, as do [[Mic Conway|Mic Conway's National Junk Band]] and [[the Blue Tongue Lizards]]. Nevertheless, in folk and traditional styles, the mandolin remains more popular in [[Irish Music]] and other traditional repertoires.\n\n==Austria==\nAs the capital of an empire bordering Italy, musicians traveled to Vienna to work, compose and teach. Vienna was \"the centre for the cultivation of mandolin playing\" in the last part of the 18th century, and music written for mandolin has been preserved there.<ref name=WolkiHistory2>{{cite book |last= W\u00f6lki |first=Konrad |translator-last1= Harris|translator-first1= Keith |date=1984 |title=Geschichte der Mandoline |trans-title= History of the Mandolin |url= |language= English|location= Arlington, Virginia|publisher= Plucked String |page=10 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Composers and players who worked there or whose works have been preserved include [[Leonhard von Call|Leonhard d'Call]], [[Georg Druschetzky]], [[Giovanni Giuliani]], [[Giovanni Hoffmann]], [[Leopold Kozeluch]], [[Karl Stefan Aichelburg|Aichelbourgh]], Giuseppe Blesber, Conrad Schlick (husband to [[Regina Strinasacchi]], [[Leopold Neuhauser]], Vincent Neuling.<ref name=WolkiHistory2/>\n\n== Belgium ==\nIn the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras (Estudiantinas) were active in Belgium.

She is now also professor mandolin at the music high school \u201cKoninklijk Conservatorium Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen\u201d. She also gives various concerts each year in different ensembles.

The Portuguese have a long tradition of mandolins and mandolin-like instruments and brought their music to their colonies.\n\nIn modern Brazilian music, the bandolim is almost exclusively a melody instrument, often accompanied by the chordal accompaniment of the [[cavaquinho]], a steel stringed instrument similar to a [[ukulele]]. The bandolim's popularity has risen and fallen with instrumental folk music styles, especially [[choro]]. The later part of the 20th century saw a renaissance of choro in Brazil, and with it, a revival of the country's mandolin tradition. Composer and mandolin virtuoso, [[Jacob do Bandolim]], did much to popularize the instrument through many recordings, and his influence continues to the present day. Some contemporary mandolin players in Brazil include Jacob's disciple [[D\u00e9o Rian]], and [[Hamilton de Holanda]] (the former, a traditional choro-style player, the latter an eclectic innovator.)

An important German composer for mandolin and mandolin orchestra of the 20th century was [[Konrad W\u00f6lki]]; he was instrumental in bringing musicological recognition of the mandolin and the orchestra. Mandolin orchestras are still playing in Germany, in various chamber music ensembles and as a solo instrument. The instrument is popular enough today that there is an increasing number of professional mandolin players and composers writing new works for the mandolin.\n\nAt the college level the mandolin has a presence, in the professorial chair for mandolins, chaired by Caterina Lichtenberg. She succeeded Marga Wilden-H\u00fcsgen at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln, in Wuppertal. Another program with specialized training for students offering a diploma in this instrument takes place by Gertrud Weyhofen at the Music Academy Kassel and more recently at the University of Music Saar and by Steffen Trekel at Hamburg Conservatory.\n\nThe instrument was present in the folk revival of the 1970s. One mandolin player was Erich Schmeckenbecher in the duo ''[[Zupfgeigenhansel]]''. Comedian Hans S\u00fcper played a modified mandolin, which he called his \"Bovec,\" in the duo ''Colonia''.\n\n== Greece ==\nThe mandolin has a long tradition in the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] islands (the ''[[Heptanese]]'') and [[Crete]], and later in the Urban centers of Southern Mainland Greece. It has long been played in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands outside the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It is common to see [[Cantata#The kantades of the Ionian Islands|choirs accompanied by mandolin players]] (the ''mandolin\u00e1tes'') in the [[Ionian islands]] and especially in the cities of [[Corfu]], [[Zakynthos]], [[Lefkada]] and [[Kefalonia]]. The evolution of the repertoire for choir and mandolins (''kant\u00e1des'') occurred during [[Venice|Venetian]] rule over the islands.\n\nOn the island of [[Crete]], along with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|lyra]] and the laouto ([[lute]]), the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in [[Music of Crete|Cretan Music]]. It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island. Different variants of the mandolin, such as the \"mantola,\" were used to accompany the lyra, the [[violin]], and the laouto. Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the ''mpoulgari'' were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno. There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman's musical instrument. Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] islands and Crete.\n\n[[Nikolaos Lavdas]] was a significant composer and mandolinists for Greece, who was the founder and director of the \"[https://athenianmandolinata.com/about/ Athenian Mandolinata]\", one of the oldest music associations and music schools in Greece.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art music in the Balkans |last=Shupo |first=Sokol |page=63 |year=2004 |publisher=ASMUS |oclc=443331457 }}</ref>\n\n== India ==\n:[[:Category:Indian mandolinists|See Indian mandolinists]]\n[[File:U.

The movie [[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]] (1995) used mandolin in several places. Bollywood music composer [[Sajjad Hussain (composer)|Ustad Sajjad Hussain]] (1917 \u2013 1995) played the mandolin as a \"Top Grade\" player for the Indian film industry in Mumbai for more than five decades and was reputed to have played more than 22,000 songs, including title-songs and background music.<ref name=Hussain>{{cite web |url= http://meetkalakar.com/Artist/1509-Mustafa-Sajjad-Hussain |title= Mustafa Sajjad Hussain, Mandolin artist|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Meetkalakar.com |publisher= |access-date= 30 August 2018|quote=}}</ref> Besides the music for movies, he was known to play Indian classical music (Hindustani), as well as Arab and Sufi music.<ref name=Hussain/>\n\nAdoption of the mandolin in [[Carnatic music]] is recent and involves an electric instrument. [[U. Srinivas]] (1969-2014) has, over the last couple of decades, made his version of the mandolin very popular in India and abroad.\n\nMany adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music.\nIn [[Indian classical music]] and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin, is usually tuned E\u2013B\u2013E\u2013B. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C\u2013G\u2013C\u2013G, which corresponds to ''sa\u2013pa\u2013sa\u2013pa'' in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], dance music popular in Punjabi culture.\n\n[[Uppalapu Rajesh]] is another performer using the mandolin in Indian music, playing Indian classical music, jazz-fusion, and world music. He was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.<ref name=\"CR2\">{{cite news|title= Soul Strings: U Rajesh on the legacy of playing an Italian lute in the Carnatic classical system |url= http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/u-rajesh-soul-strings-4803160/ |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204500/http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/u-rajesh-soul-strings-4803160/ |archivedate= 22 March 2018 }}</ref> He is brother to U.

Fiddle tunes are readily accessible to the mandolin player because of the equivalent tuning and range of the two instruments, and the practically identical (allowing for the lack of frets on the fiddle) left hand fingerings.\n\nThough almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music, virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] mandolinists. The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session (as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player's lap), whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear. The f-hole mandolin, however, does come into its own in a traditional session, where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub. Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped \"Irish-style\" mandolins (reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin) and carved (arch) top mandolins with oval soundholes, such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s.\n\nNoteworthy Irish mandolinists include [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] (who, like [[Johnny Moynihan]], almost always tunes the top E down to D, to achieve an open tuning of G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013D),<ref name=\"Walsh\">{{cite book|last1=\u00d3 Callanain|first1= Niall|last2=Walsh|first2= Tommy|year=1989|title= The Irish Bouzouki|location=Ireland|publisher= Waltons|isbn= 0-7866-1595-8}}</ref>{{rp|38}} [[Paul Brady]], [[Mick Moloney]], [[Paul Kelly (Irish musician)|Paul Kelly]] and Claudine Langille. [[John Sheahan]] and the late [[Barney McKenna]], respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with [[the Dubliners]], are also accomplished Irish mandolin players. The instruments used are either flat-backed, oval hole examples as described above (made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars), or carved-top, oval hole instruments with arched back (made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland). The Irish guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]] often played the mandolin on stage, and he most famously used it in the song \"Going To My Hometown.\"\n\n== Israel ==\n:[[:Category:Israeli mandolinists|See Israeli mandolinists]]\n\nThe re-founding of Israel after World War II drew people from all across the world.

The mandolin was played by [[Mike Oldfield]] (and introduced by [[Vivian Stanshall]]) on Oldfield's album ''[[Tubular Bells]]'', as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on ''[[Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974) and ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]], who featured two members on the instrument, [[Ray Jackson (musician)|Ray Jackson]] and Simon Cowe, and whose \"[[Fog on the Tyne]]\" was the biggest selling UK album of 1971\u201372. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Steeleye Span]] taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. \"[[Maggie May]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]], which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including \"[[Going to California]]\" and \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\"; the mandolin part on \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\" is played by [[Jimmy Page]], who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are \"[[Hey Hey What Can I Do]]\", and \"[[Black Country Woman]]\". [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] played mandolin on the track \"[[Mike Post Theme]]\", along with many other tracks on ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]''. [[McGuinness Flint]], for whom [[Graham Lyle]] played the mandolin on their most successful single, ''[[When I'm Dead And Gone]]'', is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of [[Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance]], and played mandolin on their hit \"[[How Come]]\". One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was [[Robin Williamson]] in [[the Incredible String Band]]. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player, as is his guitarist [[Martin Barre]]. The popular song \"[[Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want]]\" by [[the Smiths]] featured a mandolin solo played by [[Johnny Marr]]. More recently, the Glasgow-based band [[Sons and Daughters (band)|Sons and Daughters]] featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as \"Fight\", \"Start to End\", and \"Medicine\". British [[folk punk|folk-punk]] icons [[the Levellers (band)|the Levellers]] also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. British comedian [[Ade Edmondson]] took the role of lead mandolin in his folk punk band, [[Bad Shepherds]]. Current bands are also beginning to use the mandolin and its unique sound, such as South London's [[Indigo Moss]] who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of [[Matthew Bellamy]] in the rock band [[Muse (band)|Muse]]. It also forms the basis of [[Paul McCartney]]'s 2007 hit \"[[Dance Tonight]]\".

In spite of the mandolin having arrived in America, it was not in the national consciousness until after 1880 when the Spanish Students arrived on their international performing tour. Afterwards, a \"mandolin craze\" swept the United States, with large numbers of young people taking up the instrument and teachers such as [[Samuel Siegel]] touring the country. The fad died out after World War I, but enough had learned the instrument that it remained. The mandolin found a new surge with the music of [[Bill Monroe]]; the Gibson F-5 mandolin he played, as well as other [[Mandolin#Archtop|archtop instruments]], became the American standard for mandolins. [[Mandolin#Bowlback|Bowlback mandolins]] were displaced. The instrument has been taken up in blues, bluegrass, jug-band music, country, rock, punk, Celtic and other genres of music. While not as popular as the guitar, it is widespread across the country.\n\n== Venezuela ==\nAs in Brazil, the mandolin has played an important role in the [[Music of Venezuela]]. It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country. Specifically, the eastern states of Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of [[Joropo]] as well as [[Punto (Venezuela)|Puntos]], [[Jota (music)|Jotas]], [[Polo]]s, Fulias, [[Merengue music|Merengues]] and [[Malague\u00f1a (genre)|Malague\u00f1as]]. Also, in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes: Bambucos, Pasillos, Pasodobles, and Waltzes. In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas, Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas; in the capital, [[Caracas]], the Merengue Rucaneao, Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century. Today, Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama, Jesus Rengel, Ricardo Sandoval, Saul Vera, and Cristobal Soto.\n\n== Vietnam ==\n[[File:Ph\u00f2ng tr\u01b0ng b\u00e0y ngh\u1ec7 thu\u1eadt c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng 1496655927699.jpg|right|thumb|Three musical instruments with scalloped necks, guitar, mandolin, and a possible hybrid of the two.<ref name=Vietnameseinstruments>{{cite web |url=http://www.ddth.com/showthread.php/106779-T%C3%ACm-hi%E1%BB%83u-c%C3%A1c-lo%E1%BA%A1i-nh%E1%BA%A1c-c%E1%BB%A5-!!!?s=6a3493baf1d9d961a426bc6b8d2031d4 |title= Ch\u1ee7 \u0111\u1ec1: T\u00ecm hi\u1ec3u c\u00e1c lo\u1ea1i nh\u1ea1c c\u1ee5 !!! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=December 11, 2006 |website=ddth.com |publisher= |access-date=June 4, 2017 |quote=[translation:] around 1938-1939 a new style was born, the guitar was smaller than the guitar but bigger than the mandolin and they gave it a name called \"guitar mandarin\".}}</ref>]]\n\nThe French ruled Vietnam completely by 1884 and set up a system of modern education.

The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with [[mandolin orchestra]]s, so called ''Estudiantinas'' or in Germany ''Zupforchestern'', appearing in many cities. Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family, local traditions appeared outside Europe in the Americas and in Japan. Travelling mandolin virtuosi like [[Giuseppe Pettine]], [[Raffaele Calace]] and [[Silvio Ranieri]] contributed to the mandolin becoming a \"fad\" instrument in the early 20th century.<ref name=academicpaper/> This \"mandolin craze\" was fading by the 1930s, but just as this practice was falling into disuse, the mandolin found a new niche in American [[country music|country]], [[old-time music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]]. More recently, the [[Baroque]] and [[Classical music|Classical]] mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in [[Early music]], with media attention to classical players such as Israeli [[Avi Avital]], Italian [[Carlo Aonzo]] and American [[Joseph Brent]].\n\nSee also: [[History of the mandolin]]\n\n== Algeria ==\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | image1 = Karim tizouiar.jpg\n | width1 = 176\n | alt1 = Karim Tizouiar with a mandole\n | caption1 = Karim Tizouiar with a mandole.

Mandolins and larger members of the mandolin family were used in orchestras, including orchestras playing native Algerian music. With the decline of the mandolin worldwide, the mandolin became less common until by the 21st century it was rare. However, mandolins and [[mandolas]] are still occasionally made by luthiers. The major mandolin-family instrument in use today is the mandocello-sized [[mondol]] or \"mandole\" (French word for mandola applied to the new instrument). The flatback instrument was the result of a corroboration between an Italian luthier and an Algerian musician and was used initially for [[Chaabi]]. It has since spread to other music forms. Prominent players today include [[Mohamed Rouane]], [[Takfarinas]], Mohamed Abdennour (P'tit Moh), [[Abderrahmane Abdelli]] and Kader Fahem. Past players include [[El Hadj M'Hamed El Anka]], [[Boudjemaa El Ankis]], [[El Hachemi Guerouabi]], [[Amar Ezzahi]], [[Cheikh El Hasnaoui]], and [[Loun\u00e8s Matoub]]. The mondol received some international attention on the movie ''El Gusto'' a featuring the reunion of some chaabi players (including a mondol player) years after the turmoil in Algeria came out in the 2010s.\n\n== Australia ==\n:[[:Category:Australian mandolinists|See Australian mandolinists]]\nThe earliest references to the mandolin in [[Australia]] come from [[Phil Skinner]] (1903\u20131991). In his article \"Recollections\"<ref name=\"Skinner\">Recollections - by Phil Skinner.  FIGA magazine January February 1981 (Fretted Instrument Guild of America)</ref> he mentions a [[Walter Stent]], who was \"active in the early part of the century and organised possibly the first Mandolin Orchestra in [[Sydney]].\"\n\nPhil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia, and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community. He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning [[music]] at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the [[banjo]]. Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18, until the [[Great Depression]] forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments. Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra, the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fame.asn.au/sydney/history.htm|title=The Sydney Mandolin Orchestra - history|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=21 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227174540/http://www.fame.asn.au/sydney/history.htm|archivedate=27 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sydney Mandolins (Artistic Director: Adrian Hooper) have contributed greatly to the repertoire through commissioning over 200 works by Australian and International composers. Most of these works have been released on Compact Disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the ABC and MBS networks. One of their members, mandolin virtuoso Paul Hooper, has had a number of Concertos written for him by composers such as Eric Gross. He has performed and recorded these works with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. As well, Paul Hooper has had many solo works dedicated to him by Australian composers e.g., Caroline Szeto, Larry Sitsky and Michael Smetanin, as well as other works by Robert Allworth and Betty Beath.<!--I trimmed some detail from this that was too off point for the article.-->\n\nIn January 1979, the [[Federation of Australian Mandolin Ensembles]] (FAME) Inc. formed. [[Bruce Morey]] from [[Melbourne]] is the first FAME President. An Australian Mandolin Orchestra toured [[Germany]] in May 1980.\n\nAustralian popular groups such as [[My Friend The Chocolate Cake]] use the mandolin extensively. [[The McClymonts]] also use the mandolin, as do [[Mic Conway|Mic Conway's National Junk Band]] and [[the Blue Tongue Lizards]]. Nevertheless, in folk and traditional styles, the mandolin remains more popular in [[Irish Music]] and other traditional repertoires.\n\n==Austria==\nAs the capital of an empire bordering Italy, musicians traveled to Vienna to work, compose and teach.

The bandolim's popularity has risen and fallen with instrumental folk music styles, especially [[choro]]. The later part of the 20th century saw a renaissance of choro in Brazil, and with it, a revival of the country's mandolin tradition.

An important German composer for mandolin and mandolin orchestra of the 20th century was [[Konrad W\u00f6lki]]; he was instrumental in bringing musicological recognition of the mandolin and the orchestra. Mandolin orchestras are still playing in Germany, in various chamber music ensembles and as a solo instrument. The instrument is popular enough today that there is an increasing number of professional mandolin players and composers writing new works for the mandolin.\n\nAt the college level the mandolin has a presence, in the professorial chair for mandolins, chaired by Caterina Lichtenberg. She succeeded Marga Wilden-H\u00fcsgen at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln, in Wuppertal. Another program with specialized training for students offering a diploma in this instrument takes place by Gertrud Weyhofen at the Music Academy Kassel and more recently at the University of Music Saar and by Steffen Trekel at Hamburg Conservatory.\n\nThe instrument was present in the folk revival of the 1970s. One mandolin player was Erich Schmeckenbecher in the duo ''[[Zupfgeigenhansel]]''. Comedian Hans S\u00fcper played a modified mandolin, which he called his \"Bovec,\" in the duo ''Colonia''.\n\n== Greece ==\nThe mandolin has a long tradition in the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] islands (the ''[[Heptanese]]'') and [[Crete]], and later in the Urban centers of Southern Mainland Greece. It has long been played in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands outside the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It is common to see [[Cantata#The kantades of the Ionian Islands|choirs accompanied by mandolin players]] (the ''mandolin\u00e1tes'') in the [[Ionian islands]] and especially in the cities of [[Corfu]], [[Zakynthos]], [[Lefkada]] and [[Kefalonia]]. The evolution of the repertoire for choir and mandolins (''kant\u00e1des'') occurred during [[Venice|Venetian]] rule over the islands.\n\nOn the island of [[Crete]], along with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|lyra]] and the laouto ([[lute]]), the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in [[Music of Crete|Cretan Music]]. It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island. Different variants of the mandolin, such as the \"mantola,\" were used to accompany the lyra, the [[violin]], and the laouto. Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the ''mpoulgari'' were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno. There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman's musical instrument. Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] islands and Crete.\n\n[[Nikolaos Lavdas]] was a significant composer and mandolinists for Greece, who was the founder and director of the \"[https://athenianmandolinata.com/about/ Athenian Mandolinata]\", one of the oldest music associations and music schools in Greece.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art music in the Balkans |last=Shupo |first=Sokol |page=63 |year=2004 |publisher=ASMUS |oclc=443331457 }}</ref>\n\n== India ==\n:[[:Category:Indian mandolinists|See Indian mandolinists]]\n[[File:U.

The movie [[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]] (1995) used mandolin in several places. Bollywood music composer [[Sajjad Hussain (composer)|Ustad Sajjad Hussain]] (1917 \u2013 1995) played the mandolin as a \"Top Grade\" player for the Indian film industry in Mumbai for more than five decades and was reputed to have played more than 22,000 songs, including title-songs and background music.<ref name=Hussain>{{cite web |url= http://meetkalakar.com/Artist/1509-Mustafa-Sajjad-Hussain |title= Mustafa Sajjad Hussain, Mandolin artist|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Meetkalakar.com |publisher= |access-date= 30 August 2018|quote=}}</ref> Besides the music for movies, he was known to play Indian classical music (Hindustani), as well as Arab and Sufi music.<ref name=Hussain/>\n\nAdoption of the mandolin in [[Carnatic music]] is recent and involves an electric instrument. [[U. Srinivas]] (1969-2014) has, over the last couple of decades, made his version of the mandolin very popular in India and abroad.\n\nMany adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music.\nIn [[Indian classical music]] and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin, is usually tuned E\u2013B\u2013E\u2013B. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C\u2013G\u2013C\u2013G, which corresponds to ''sa\u2013pa\u2013sa\u2013pa'' in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], dance music popular in Punjabi culture.\n\n[[Uppalapu Rajesh]] is another performer using the mandolin in Indian music, playing Indian classical music, jazz-fusion, and world music. He was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.<ref name=\"CR2\">{{cite news|title= Soul Strings: U Rajesh on the legacy of playing an Italian lute in the Carnatic classical system |url= http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/u-rajesh-soul-strings-4803160/ |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204500/http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/u-rajesh-soul-strings-4803160/ |archivedate= 22 March 2018 }}</ref> He is brother to U.

Fiddle tunes are readily accessible to the mandolin player because of the equivalent tuning and range of the two instruments, and the practically identical (allowing for the lack of frets on the fiddle) left hand fingerings.\n\nThough almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music, virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] mandolinists. The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session (as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player's lap), whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear. The f-hole mandolin, however, does come into its own in a traditional session, where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub. Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped \"Irish-style\" mandolins (reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin) and carved (arch) top mandolins with oval soundholes, such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s.\n\nNoteworthy Irish mandolinists include [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] (who, like [[Johnny Moynihan]], almost always tunes the top E down to D, to achieve an open tuning of G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013D),<ref name=\"Walsh\">{{cite book|last1=\u00d3 Callanain|first1= Niall|last2=Walsh|first2= Tommy|year=1989|title= The Irish Bouzouki|location=Ireland|publisher= Waltons|isbn= 0-7866-1595-8}}</ref>{{rp|38}} [[Paul Brady]], [[Mick Moloney]], [[Paul Kelly (Irish musician)|Paul Kelly]] and Claudine Langille. [[John Sheahan]] and the late [[Barney McKenna]], respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with [[the Dubliners]], are also accomplished Irish mandolin players. The instruments used are either flat-backed, oval hole examples as described above (made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars), or carved-top, oval hole instruments with arched back (made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland). The Irish guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]] often played the mandolin on stage, and he most famously used it in the song \"Going To My Hometown.\"\n\n== Israel ==\n:[[:Category:Israeli mandolinists|See Israeli mandolinists]]\n\nThe re-founding of Israel after World War II drew people from all across the world.

The mandolin was played by [[Mike Oldfield]] (and introduced by [[Vivian Stanshall]]) on Oldfield's album ''[[Tubular Bells]]'', as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on ''[[Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974) and ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]], who featured two members on the instrument, [[Ray Jackson (musician)|Ray Jackson]] and Simon Cowe, and whose \"[[Fog on the Tyne]]\" was the biggest selling UK album of 1971\u201372. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Steeleye Span]] taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. \"[[Maggie May]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]], which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including \"[[Going to California]]\" and \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\"; the mandolin part on \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\" is played by [[Jimmy Page]], who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are \"[[Hey Hey What Can I Do]]\", and \"[[Black Country Woman]]\". [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] played mandolin on the track \"[[Mike Post Theme]]\", along with many other tracks on ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]''. [[McGuinness Flint]], for whom [[Graham Lyle]] played the mandolin on their most successful single, ''[[When I'm Dead And Gone]]'', is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of [[Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance]], and played mandolin on their hit \"[[How Come]]\". One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was [[Robin Williamson]] in [[the Incredible String Band]]. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player, as is his guitarist [[Martin Barre]]. The popular song \"[[Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want]]\" by [[the Smiths]] featured a mandolin solo played by [[Johnny Marr]]. More recently, the Glasgow-based band [[Sons and Daughters (band)|Sons and Daughters]] featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as \"Fight\", \"Start to End\", and \"Medicine\". British [[folk punk|folk-punk]] icons [[the Levellers (band)|the Levellers]] also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. British comedian [[Ade Edmondson]] took the role of lead mandolin in his folk punk band, [[Bad Shepherds]]. Current bands are also beginning to use the mandolin and its unique sound, such as South London's [[Indigo Moss]] who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of [[Matthew Bellamy]] in the rock band [[Muse (band)|Muse]]. It also forms the basis of [[Paul McCartney]]'s 2007 hit \"[[Dance Tonight]]\". That was not the first time a [[Beatle]] played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to [[George Harrison]] on \"[[Gone Troppo]]\", the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Also more recently [[hard rock]] supergroup [[Them Crooked Vultures]] have been playing a song, ''Highway One'' in which Jones \"morphs an effected mandolin bluegrass run into a slick rock riff\".<ref name=vulturesjones>{{cite web |url= https://www.jambase.com/article/them-crooked-vultures-02-08-nyc|title= Them Crooked Vultures, 02.08, NYC|last=  Dembinsky|first= Ryan|date= 11 February 2010|website= |publisher=jambase.com |access-date=17 April 2018 |quote=}}</ref> This song was left off their debut album ''[[Them Crooked Vultures (album)|Them Crooked Vultures]]'', and features former [[Led Zeppelin]] [[bassist]] [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].<ref name=vulturesjones/>\n\nIn the Classical style, performers such as Hugo D'Alton, [[Alison Stephens]] and Michael Hooper have continued to play music by British composers such as [[Michael Finnissy]], James Humberstone and Elspeth Brooke.\n\nThe mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== United States ==\nSee: [[Mandolins in North America]] and [[Bluegrass mandolin]]\n:[[:Category:American mandolinists|See American mandolinists]] and [[:Category:American bluegrass mandolinists|American bluegrass mandolinists]]\n\nThe [[mandolin]] has had a place in North American culture since the 1880s, when a \"mandolin craze\" began.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Mandolin-Mad Belles, The new musical craze among fashionable News York girls|url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3181695/mandolin_madness_in_girls/ |work= The Times|location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date= 27 Mar 1886|page=3 |access-date= 12 May 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= A mandolin craze |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6925750/mandolin_craze_1895/ |work= The Weekly Wisconsin|location= |date= 2 Mar 1895| page=1 |access-date=12 May 2012 }} </ref> \n\nThe continent was a land of immigrants, including Italian immigrants, some of whom brought their mandolins with them. In spite of the mandolin having arrived in America, it was not in the national consciousness until after 1880 when the Spanish Students arrived on their international performing tour. Afterwards, a \"mandolin craze\" swept the United States, with large numbers of young people taking up the instrument and teachers such as [[Samuel Siegel]] touring the country. The fad died out after World War I, but enough had learned the instrument that it remained. The mandolin found a new surge with the music of [[Bill Monroe]]; the Gibson F-5 mandolin he played, as well as other [[Mandolin#Archtop|archtop instruments]], became the American standard for mandolins. [[Mandolin#Bowlback|Bowlback mandolins]] were displaced. The instrument has been taken up in blues, bluegrass, jug-band music, country, rock, punk, Celtic and other genres of music. While not as popular as the guitar, it is widespread across the country.\n\n== Venezuela ==\nAs in Brazil, the mandolin has played an important role in the [[Music of Venezuela]]. It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country. Specifically, the eastern states of Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of [[Joropo]] as well as [[Punto (Venezuela)|Puntos]], [[Jota (music)|Jotas]], [[Polo]]s, Fulias, [[Merengue music|Merengues]] and [[Malague\u00f1a (genre)|Malague\u00f1as]]. Also, in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes: Bambucos, Pasillos, Pasodobles, and Waltzes. In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas, Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas; in the capital, [[Caracas]], the Merengue Rucaneao, Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century. Today, Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama, Jesus Rengel, Ricardo Sandoval, Saul Vera, and Cristobal Soto.\n\n== Vietnam ==\n[[File:Ph\u00f2ng tr\u01b0ng b\u00e0y ngh\u1ec7 thu\u1eadt c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng 1496655927699.jpg|right|thumb|Three musical instruments with scalloped necks, guitar, mandolin, and a possible hybrid of the two.<ref name=Vietnameseinstruments>{{cite web |url=http://www.ddth.com/showthread.php/106779-T%C3%ACm-hi%E1%BB%83u-c%C3%A1c-lo%E1%BA%A1i-nh%E1%BA%A1c-c%E1%BB%A5-!!!?s=6a3493baf1d9d961a426bc6b8d2031d4 |title= Ch\u1ee7 \u0111\u1ec1: T\u00ecm hi\u1ec3u c\u00e1c lo\u1ea1i nh\u1ea1c c\u1ee5 !!! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=December 11, 2006 |website=ddth.com |publisher= |access-date=June 4, 2017 |quote=[translation:] around 1938-1939 a new style was born, the guitar was smaller than the guitar but bigger than the mandolin and they gave it a name called \"guitar mandarin\".}}</ref>]]\n\nThe French ruled Vietnam completely by 1884 and set up a system of modern education.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.

The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions to either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.

One day while swimming in the sea, he thinks he sees the body of a dead boy with a red starfish at his waist. He tells his mother, who goes diving and brings back the starfish, but she tells him there is no body there. Later that night, his mother brings back the body and the other mothers gather around it. \n\nThe following day Nicolas plays with his starfish. After another boy mocks him for being afraid of it, he grows angry and attacks the boy, and later hacks off one of the arms of the starfish. After his outburst, his mother takes him to a hospital for observation. At the hospital, a doctor makes an incision just above Nicolas' stomach. Nicolas finds himself in a ward with other boys who have been similarly operated on. \n\nOnce released, Nicolas begins to suspect his mother and the nurses of having lied to him. He and his friend, Victor, sneak out in the middle of the night to observe what the mothers are doing. Victor runs back home, but Nicolas sees the women lying together completely nude, writhing around in mud, and passing an object from one to another. At home, he sneaks a peek at his mother as she is showering off the mud and observes that she has what appears to be [[Cephalopod limb|suckers]] on her back.\n\nBack at the hospital, Nicolas is given an ultrasound. To his mother's apparent joy, they hear the heart beat of a fetus. Victor is operated on and a creature is taken out of his stomach and put in a jar.  Victor dies during the operation, but the nurses tell Nicolas and the other boys that he is recovering. A nurse brings a conch shell into the ward, saying that Victor has sent it to them. Nicolas's mother visits him and he accuses her of not being his mother, a conclusion echoed by one of the other boys. \n\nAt night the nurses watch videos of [[cesarean section|cesarean sections]] being performed. \n\nNicolas develops a friendship with one of the nurses, Stella.  Stella sneaks Nicolas crayons and draws with him. Nicolas' drawings include a dead boy and starfishes but also a bicycle, a car, a building, and a giraffe. Nicolas is drawing these from memory, but since most of these things are not near the sea. this suggests that he was kidnapped and brought there. The other boys on the island may also have been kidnapped as some of them observe that their mothers are not really their mothers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution Plot|url=https://www.thisisbarry.com/film/evolution-2015-movie-plot-ending-explained/|work=Evolution Plot}}</ref>\n\nOne night Stella takes Nicolas down to the sea, shows him the [[Cephalopod limb|suckers]] on her back, and allows him to touch them before taking him into the water. She holds him under water until he drowns, then revives him using CPR. Nicholas goes back to the hospital, where he sees one of the boys floating in a tank. After a final surgery, Nicolas awakens in the tank himself. He is in restraints and sees what appears to be a baby inside the tank with him. \n\nNicolas again finds himself by the sea with Stella. They again enter the water, but this time she presses her mouth to his as she swims with him, giving him air to breathe underwater. She pushes him to the surface and the two end up in a small rowboat floating away from the island. After making sure Nicolas has a drink of fresh water, Stella slips back into the sea, presumably to go back to the island. Nicolas stays on the boat and by nightfall finds himself approaching the harbour of a major city.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Max Brebant]] as Nicolas\n* [[Roxane Duran]] as Stella\n* [[Julie-Marie Parmentier]] as Mother\n* [[Nissim Renard]] as Frank\n* [[Mathieu Goldfeld]] as Victor\n* [[Pablo-No\u00e9 \u00c9tienne]] as Lucas\n\n==Critical response==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2019}}\n''Evolution'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

Nicolas's mother visits him and he accuses her of not being his mother, a conclusion echoed by one of the other boys. \n\nAt night the nurses watch videos of [[cesarean section|cesarean sections]] being performed. \n\nNicolas develops a friendship with one of the nurses, Stella.  Stella sneaks Nicolas crayons and draws with him. Nicolas' drawings include a dead boy and starfishes but also a bicycle, a car, a building, and a giraffe. Nicolas is drawing these from memory, but since most of these things are not near the sea. this suggests that he was kidnapped and brought there. The other boys on the island may also have been kidnapped as some of them observe that their mothers are not really their mothers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution Plot|url=https://www.thisisbarry.com/film/evolution-2015-movie-plot-ending-explained/|work=Evolution Plot}}</ref>\n\nOne night Stella takes Nicolas down to the sea, shows him the [[Cephalopod limb|suckers]] on her back, and allows him to touch them before taking him into the water. She holds him under water until he drowns, then revives him using CPR. Nicholas goes back to the hospital, where he sees one of the boys floating in a tank. After a final surgery, Nicolas awakens in the tank himself. He is in restraints and sees what appears to be a baby inside the tank with him. \n\nNicolas again finds himself by the sea with Stella. They again enter the water, but this time she presses her mouth to his as she swims with him, giving him air to breathe underwater. She pushes him to the surface and the two end up in a small rowboat floating away from the island. After making sure Nicolas has a drink of fresh water, Stella slips back into the sea, presumably to go back to the island. Nicolas stays on the boat and by nightfall finds himself approaching the harbour of a major city.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Max Brebant]] as Nicolas\n* [[Roxane Duran]] as Stella\n* [[Julie-Marie Parmentier]] as Mother\n* [[Nissim Renard]] as Frank\n* [[Mathieu Goldfeld]] as Victor\n* [[Pablo-No\u00e9 \u00c9tienne]] as Lucas\n\n==Critical response==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2019}}\n''Evolution'' received generally positive reviews from critics.
