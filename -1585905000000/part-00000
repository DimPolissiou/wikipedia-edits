The police suspect Tony ([[Dharmendra]]) generally known in the community as a thief, but he claims innocence.  He tries to find out who the real burglar is and catches Sandhya ([[Tanuja]]) stealing from one of the wealthy men.  She tells him that she is taking back what is really her inheritance, as these items belong to her mother ([[Shobhana Samarth]]) since these four men swindled her mother after her father's death.  Her mother is now in a mental institution. Tony and Sandhya fall in love.  He helps her recover all of her items and put the wealthy men behind bars. Sandhya's mother is well again. Tony and Sandhya promise to start a life together after they finish their respective short jail stints.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dharmendra]] as Tony\n*[[Tanuja]] as Sandhya\n*[[K. N.

The property was to provide for the founding of a grammar school, \"for the training of intelligence in whatever social rank of life it may be found among the vast and varied population of the Town.\"<ref>[[s:Hymers, John (DNB00)|John Hymers]], Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 6 January 2010.</ref> Although an infelicity in the wording of the will rendered the bequest invalid, his brother and heir, Robert Hymers, voluntarily granted the sum of \u00a350,000 to establish the school.\n\nHymers opened in 1893, on the site of the old Botanic Gardens of Hull, as a school for boys.<ref name=hymHist /> The school quickly established itself, and the first headmaster, Charles Gore, was soon admitted into the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|HMC]], with all subsequent headmasters also being members. Hymers was a fee-paying school for most of its history, and many scholarships and bursaries were given to pupils whose parents' could not afford the fees, in accordance with John Hymers' will for the training of intelligence, regardless of social rank. In 1946 Hymers became a \"direct grant\" school, with many pupils being paid for by the local authority, in a similar system to today's [[Academy (English school)|academies]]. However, this scheme ended in 1971, and the school governors chose to become a fully independent school, rather than joining into the new [[Comprehensive school#United Kingdom|comprehensive system]], and re-established the bursaries system after the Government-funded Assisted Places scheme ended in 1997.<ref name=hymHist />\n\nFrom 1972, girls (initially just two) were admitted to the [[sixth form]], and in 1989 the decision was made to become fully co-educational. With the opening of the [[Humber bridge]] in 1981, the school's catchment area increased to cover the south bank of the [[Humber|River Humber]], resulting in the school's numbers extending to their current figure of just under one thousand pupils in the 1990s.<ref name=hymHist />\n\n==Primary education==\nThe College has a Junior School which accepts pupils into Years 4, 5 and 6 via an entrance exam, or through the \"Associate Schools\" program. Hymers currently has two associate schools: Hessle Mount School and Froebel House School, both of which provide education from [[Reception (school)|reception]]. There is a system of academic tracking with Associate Schools, so that pupils attending these schools do not need to take the entrance exam for entry to the Junior School. Usually, there are just over 200 pupils in all three years of the Junior School (228 in the 2008 [[Independent Schools Inspectorate|ISI]] report).<ref>{{cite web|title=INSPECTION REPORT ON Hymers College|url=http://www.isi.net/schools/6573/|publisher=[[Independent Schools Inspectorate]]|page=1, section 1.3|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, construction of a new Junior School building was completed, to replace an older building that has since been demolished.\n\nAll children are sorted into one of the following four houses at the beginning of Year 4: Brandesburton, Gore, Holderness, and Trinity.\n\n==Secondary education==\nThere has been a steady development of buildings and facilities, including design and technology workshops, art studios, language resource rooms, and IT suites. In recent years additional land has been purchased, a [[theatre]] (opened by and named after [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]]), a music centre, science laboratories, an all-weather sports pitch, and other [[sports]] facilities have been constructed. A [[swimming pool]] was added in 2005.\n\nThe school library was closed in 2001, with the majority of books being redistributed to decentralised resource rooms. This was upon the advice of government inspectors, who argued that the library in its previous form was underused.\n\nA new \"Learning Resource Centre\" was opened in 2016, in response to an [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]] report from 2008, in which it was stated that \"[Pupils] are limited in the amount of independent study and research they can undertake while in school... by the absence of a central library resource.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=INSPECTION REPORT ON Hymers College|url=http://www.isi.net/schools/6573/|publisher=[[Independent Schools Inspectorate]]|page=6, section 2.26|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nHymers College is the best performing school in the East Riding in terms of examination results and league-table position, consistently producing an A2 Level pass rate of 99% (updated 2014 figure).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In 2018, The Sunday Times' Parent Power publication ranked Hymers College as the 94th best independent school in the country and as one of the top 10 schools in the north of England.<ref>{{cite news |title=Best secondary schools in the North |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-uk-schools-guide-secondary-in-the-north-zh52dfzxp |accessdate=19 June 2019 |publisher=The Sunday Times}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Masonic lodge]] Old Hymerian Lodge is linked to the school.<ref>[http://www.6885.org/ Old Hymerians Masonic Lodge website]</ref>\n\n==Extra-curricular activities==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Sport===\nMainstream sports are rugby and cricket, hockey and netball. The school introduced boys' hockey in January 2015. Other sports available include fencing, rounders, tennis, badminton, football, and athletics.\n\nIn more recent years the school has produced excellent teams in a wide range of sports, reaching national finals in athletics, girls' hockey, tennis, badminton, and fencing. In 2014 the Independent Sport Magazine ranked Hymers as the 26th best sports school in the country. In December 2016 the school was included in ''The Cricketer'' magazine's Top 100 Cricket Schools in the Country.\n\n===Music and drama===\nThe Judi Dench Theatre was opened in 1993 and a new Music Centre was opened by John Rutter in September 2014. The new facility contains nine individual music rooms, two classrooms, a recording studio and the Rutter Rehearsal Room. The school's musicians perform at over 35 concerts each year and increasingly take concerts out of school to perform in the local community. In 2013 the Junior School choir performed in the School Choir of the Year.\n \nDrama is taught to pupils in Years 7 and 8 with youngsters choosing to study it at GCSE and at A Level. Many students appear in the annual school play, which is performed in March each year. In addition, the Department produces plays in the Junior School and throughout the Senior School. Recent productions include ''Oliver!, Annie,'' and,''Woyzeck.''\n\n===Work in the local community===\nThe school makes a significant contribution to its local community. Hymers is the only independent school in the country to be an official training partner for the [[National Citizen Service]] (NCS). The school employs a co-ordinator who oversees the training of around 130 local students before they volunteer 30 hours in their local community. The school's annual contribution to its local community is reported on its website.\n\n===Army Cadet Force===\nUnlike most independent schools who have a CCF ([[Combined Cadet Force]]) unit, Hymers has its own [[Army Cadet Force]] (ACF) detachment currently containing around 10 cadets ranging from recruits to [[SNCO#United Kingdom|senior NCOs]].\n\nHymers College [[Royal Logistic Corps|RLC Detachment]] is affiliated to [[150th (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment|150th Transport Regiment]] of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. The detachment is in B Company of Humberside and South Yorkshire ACF.\n\n[[Image:Royal Logistic Corps Flag.png|thumb|left|175px|Camp flag of RLC]]\n[[Image:Army Cadet Force Flag.png|thumb|right|175px|Flag of the ACF]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, a pupil (who was also a cadet at another detachment in Hull) approached a teacher who had previously served in the army and suggested that the college should form its own cadet unit. The detachment's regimental affiliation was uncertain, many old Hymerians had fought during the wars in various units but one above all others featured in the records: the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]. No sponsor Parachute Regiment unit was available. The local ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|TA]]) unit was the only option, that was [[Royal Corps of Transport]] (TA) in Hull at the time the detachment formed. The detachment had the Royal Corps of Transport cap badge for only a few months before the amalgamation of the Royal Corps of Transport into the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. For many years the detachment made use of the college's [[biology]] labs and then the school gymnasium. The gymnasium had space for [[exhibition drill|drill]] indoors, [[air rifle]] shooting as well as a small armoury, which was an improvement on the science labs. The detachment commander became the company commander of E company (South Humberside) while the detachment remained in B company. When the detachment commander became the commander of A company instead of E company the detachment became part of A company (east Hull and eastern part of the East Riding of Yorkshire), this only lasted about a year and the detachment and its commander returned to B company. The detachment moved out of the gymnasium building into a new prefabricated building a couple of years ago. A concrete [[.22]] [[shooting range]] has recently been added next to the main building.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe detachment commander was until recently the same teacher who started the detachment in the early 1990s, but in 2007 he was replaced by an external officer, not a teacher from the school. Other adult instructors have also assisted with APC training, some being Old Hymerians. The cadets are taught the same APC subjects at the detachment as all other [[Army Cadet Force]] (ACF) Detachments in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] these include: [[Army Cadet Force#Skill at Arms|Skill at Arms]], [[Army Cadet Force#Fieldcraft|Fieldcraft]], and [[Army Cadet Force#Map and Compass|Map and Compass]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThis detachment is the only one in the country to have 12 above-standard certificates for its annual inspections. The land on which the detachment is built is on a 99-year lease to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and receives no funding from the College.\n\n==School associations==\nThe school is supported by a non-profit association, primarily run by parents and Old Hymerians, which host events and provide some funding for new facilities.\n\n===Hymers College Association (HCA)===\nThe HCA is a forty-year-old organization, whose primary purpose is to raise funds for the support, expansion and development of the school.<ref name=hcainfo>{{cite web|title=Hymers College Association Information Sheet|url=http://hymerscollege.co.uk/sites/default/files/files/HCA%20info%20sheet%202.pdf|publisher=The Hymers College Association}}</ref> It runs a number of annual fundraising events, including a summer Garden Party, a May Ball, second hand uniform sales, and Junior School discos and plays. In September 2016 two other organisations, Friends of Hymers Music (FOHMS) and Supporters of Hymers College Sport (SOHCS), merged with the HCA to form one fundraising organisation.\n\nItems given to the school as a result of HCA funding include the fleet of three [[minibus]]es, the ICT suite and outdoor play area in the Junior School, and the equipment in the Fitness Centre (located in the new Sports Centre, alongside the swimming pool).<ref name=hcainfo />\n\n==Former Headmasters==\n\n* Charles H.

Retrieved 6 January 2010.</ref> Although an infelicity in the wording of the will rendered the bequest invalid, his brother and heir, Robert Hymers, voluntarily granted the sum of \u00a350,000 to establish the school.\n\nHymers opened in 1893, on the site of the old Botanic Gardens of Hull, as a school for boys.<ref name=hymHist /> The school quickly established itself, and the first headmaster, Charles Gore, was soon admitted into the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|HMC]], with all subsequent headmasters also being members. Hymers was a fee-paying school for most of its history, and many scholarships and bursaries were given to pupils whose parents' could not afford the fees, in accordance with John Hymers' will for the training of intelligence, regardless of social rank. In 1946 Hymers became a \"direct grant\" school, with many pupils being paid for by the local authority, in a similar system to today's [[Academy (English school)|academies]]. However, this scheme ended in 1971, and the school governors chose to become a fully independent school, rather than joining into the new [[Comprehensive school#United Kingdom|comprehensive system]], and re-established the bursaries system after the Government-funded Assisted Places scheme ended in 1997.<ref name=hymHist />\n\nFrom 1972, girls (initially just two) were admitted to the [[sixth form]], and in 1989 the decision was made to become fully co-educational. With the opening of the [[Humber bridge]] in 1981, the school's catchment area increased to cover the south bank of the [[Humber|River Humber]], resulting in the school's numbers extending to their current figure of just under one thousand pupils in the 1990s.<ref name=hymHist />\n\n==Primary education==\nThe College has a Junior School which accepts pupils into Years 4, 5 and 6 via an entrance exam, or through the \"Associate Schools\" program. Hymers currently has two associate schools: Hessle Mount School and Froebel House School, both of which provide education from [[Reception (school)|reception]]. There is a system of academic tracking with Associate Schools, so that pupils attending these schools do not need to take the entrance exam for entry to the Junior School. Usually, there are just over 200 pupils in all three years of the Junior School (228 in the 2008 [[Independent Schools Inspectorate|ISI]] report).<ref>{{cite web|title=INSPECTION REPORT ON Hymers College|url=http://www.isi.net/schools/6573/|publisher=[[Independent Schools Inspectorate]]|page=1, section 1.3|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, construction of a new Junior School building was completed, to replace an older building that has since been demolished.\n\nAll children are sorted into one of the following four houses at the beginning of Year 4: Brandesburton, Gore, Holderness, and Trinity.\n\n==Secondary education==\nThere has been a steady development of buildings and facilities, including design and technology workshops, art studios, language resource rooms, and IT suites. In recent years additional land has been purchased, a [[theatre]] (opened by and named after [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]]), a music centre, science laboratories, an all-weather sports pitch, and other [[sports]] facilities have been constructed. A [[swimming pool]] was added in 2005.\n\nThe school library was closed in 2001, with the majority of books being redistributed to decentralised resource rooms. This was upon the advice of government inspectors, who argued that the library in its previous form was underused.\n\nA new \"Learning Resource Centre\" was opened in 2016, in response to an [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]] report from 2008, in which it was stated that \"[Pupils] are limited in the amount of independent study and research they can undertake while in school... by the absence of a central library resource.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=INSPECTION REPORT ON Hymers College|url=http://www.isi.net/schools/6573/|publisher=[[Independent Schools Inspectorate]]|page=6, section 2.26|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nHymers College is the best performing school in the East Riding in terms of examination results and league-table position, consistently producing an A2 Level pass rate of 99% (updated 2014 figure).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In 2018, The Sunday Times' Parent Power publication ranked Hymers College as the 94th best independent school in the country and as one of the top 10 schools in the north of England.<ref>{{cite news |title=Best secondary schools in the North |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-uk-schools-guide-secondary-in-the-north-zh52dfzxp |accessdate=19 June 2019 |publisher=The Sunday Times}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Masonic lodge]] Old Hymerian Lodge is linked to the school.<ref>[http://www.6885.org/ Old Hymerians Masonic Lodge website]</ref>\n\n==Extra-curricular activities==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Sport===\nMainstream sports are rugby and cricket, hockey and netball. The school introduced boys' hockey in January 2015. Other sports available include fencing, rounders, tennis, badminton, football, and athletics.\n\nIn more recent years the school has produced excellent teams in a wide range of sports, reaching national finals in athletics, girls' hockey, tennis, badminton, and fencing. In 2014 the Independent Sport Magazine ranked Hymers as the 26th best sports school in the country. In December 2016 the school was included in ''The Cricketer'' magazine's Top 100 Cricket Schools in the Country.\n\n===Music and drama===\nThe Judi Dench Theatre was opened in 1993 and a new Music Centre was opened by John Rutter in September 2014. The new facility contains nine individual music rooms, two classrooms, a recording studio and the Rutter Rehearsal Room. The school's musicians perform at over 35 concerts each year and increasingly take concerts out of school to perform in the local community. In 2013 the Junior School choir performed in the School Choir of the Year.\n \nDrama is taught to pupils in Years 7 and 8 with youngsters choosing to study it at GCSE and at A Level. Many students appear in the annual school play, which is performed in March each year. In addition, the Department produces plays in the Junior School and throughout the Senior School. Recent productions include ''Oliver!, Annie,'' and,''Woyzeck.''\n\n===Work in the local community===\nThe school makes a significant contribution to its local community. Hymers is the only independent school in the country to be an official training partner for the [[National Citizen Service]] (NCS). The school employs a co-ordinator who oversees the training of around 130 local students before they volunteer 30 hours in their local community. The school's annual contribution to its local community is reported on its website.\n\n===Army Cadet Force===\nUnlike most independent schools who have a CCF ([[Combined Cadet Force]]) unit, Hymers has its own [[Army Cadet Force]] (ACF) detachment currently containing around 10 cadets ranging from recruits to [[SNCO#United Kingdom|senior NCOs]].\n\nHymers College [[Royal Logistic Corps|RLC Detachment]] is affiliated to [[150th (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment|150th Transport Regiment]] of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. The detachment is in B Company of Humberside and South Yorkshire ACF.\n\n[[Image:Royal Logistic Corps Flag.png|thumb|left|175px|Camp flag of RLC]]\n[[Image:Army Cadet Force Flag.png|thumb|right|175px|Flag of the ACF]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, a pupil (who was also a cadet at another detachment in Hull) approached a teacher who had previously served in the army and suggested that the college should form its own cadet unit. The detachment's regimental affiliation was uncertain, many old Hymerians had fought during the wars in various units but one above all others featured in the records: the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]. No sponsor Parachute Regiment unit was available. The local ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|TA]]) unit was the only option, that was [[Royal Corps of Transport]] (TA) in Hull at the time the detachment formed. The detachment had the Royal Corps of Transport cap badge for only a few months before the amalgamation of the Royal Corps of Transport into the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. For many years the detachment made use of the college's [[biology]] labs and then the school gymnasium. The gymnasium had space for [[exhibition drill|drill]] indoors, [[air rifle]] shooting as well as a small armoury, which was an improvement on the science labs. The detachment commander became the company commander of E company (South Humberside) while the detachment remained in B company. When the detachment commander became the commander of A company instead of E company the detachment became part of A company (east Hull and eastern part of the East Riding of Yorkshire), this only lasted about a year and the detachment and its commander returned to B company. The detachment moved out of the gymnasium building into a new prefabricated building a couple of years ago. A concrete [[.22]] [[shooting range]] has recently been added next to the main building.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe detachment commander was until recently the same teacher who started the detachment in the early 1990s, but in 2007 he was replaced by an external officer, not a teacher from the school. Other adult instructors have also assisted with APC training, some being Old Hymerians. The cadets are taught the same APC subjects at the detachment as all other [[Army Cadet Force]] (ACF) Detachments in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] these include: [[Army Cadet Force#Skill at Arms|Skill at Arms]], [[Army Cadet Force#Fieldcraft|Fieldcraft]], and [[Army Cadet Force#Map and Compass|Map and Compass]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThis detachment is the only one in the country to have 12 above-standard certificates for its annual inspections. The land on which the detachment is built is on a 99-year lease to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and receives no funding from the College.\n\n==School associations==\nThe school is supported by a non-profit association, primarily run by parents and Old Hymerians, which host events and provide some funding for new facilities.\n\n===Hymers College Association (HCA)===\nThe HCA is a forty-year-old organization, whose primary purpose is to raise funds for the support, expansion and development of the school.<ref name=hcainfo>{{cite web|title=Hymers College Association Information Sheet|url=http://hymerscollege.co.uk/sites/default/files/files/HCA%20info%20sheet%202.pdf|publisher=The Hymers College Association}}</ref> It runs a number of annual fundraising events, including a summer Garden Party, a May Ball, second hand uniform sales, and Junior School discos and plays. In September 2016 two other organisations, Friends of Hymers Music (FOHMS) and Supporters of Hymers College Sport (SOHCS), merged with the HCA to form one fundraising organisation.\n\nItems given to the school as a result of HCA funding include the fleet of three [[minibus]]es, the ICT suite and outdoor play area in the Junior School, and the equipment in the Fitness Centre (located in the new Sports Centre, alongside the swimming pool).<ref name=hcainfo />\n\n==Former Headmasters==\n\n* Charles H.

It tells the story of a 14-year-old girl, Hirut Assefa (based on Aberash Bekele), who is kidnapped on her way home from school and subsequently grabs a rifle and tries to escape, but ends up shooting her would-be husband. In her village, the practice of abduction into marriage is common and one of Ethiopia's oldest traditions. [[Meaza Ashenafi]], the founder of the [[Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association]] (EWLA), arrives from the city to have her team represent Hirut and argue that she acted in self-defence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meron Getnet]] as Meaza Ashenafi\n* Tizita Hagere as Hirut Assefa\n\n==Controversy==\nThe film was temporarily banned in September 2014 for allegedly giving \"too much credit\" to Ashenafi, according to a complaint by Bekele, on whose experience the film was based. The case settled out of court and the ban was ultimately lifted.

It tells the story of a 14-year-old girl, Hirut Assefa (based on Aberash Bekele), who is kidnapped on her way home from school and subsequently grabs a rifle and tries to escape, but ends up shooting her would-be husband. In her village, the practice of abduction into marriage is common and one of Ethiopia's oldest traditions. [[Meaza Ashenafi]], the founder of the [[Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association]] (EWLA), arrives from the city to have her team represent Hirut and argue that she acted in self-defence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meron Getnet]] as Meaza Ashenafi\n* Tizita Hagere as Hirut Assefa\n\n==Controversy==\nThe film was temporarily banned in September 2014 for allegedly giving \"too much credit\" to Ashenafi, according to a complaint by Bekele, on whose experience the film was based. The case settled out of court and the ban was ultimately lifted. The film's director, Mehari, apologized to Bekele for \"any misperception and for any harm that [they] may have caused.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/ban-on-difret-film-lifted/|title=Ban on Difret film lifted  - Ethiopia Observer|work=ethiopiaobserver.com}}</ref> The film subsequently enjoyed a successful theatrical run in Ethiopia and kicked off its educational outreach efforts that are focused on raising awareness about the issue of child marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mehret-mandefro/difret-building-a-culture_b_5760922.html|title=Difret: Building a Culture of Courage|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref> Ashenafi's leadership and administration of EWLA during this time is the reason she has received several international human rights awards including the Africa Prize of [[The Hunger Project]] for her work defending vulnerable women and children in Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethiopia.usembassy.gov/pr0808.html|title=Press Release 2008 - Embassy of the United States Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|work=usembassy.gov|access-date=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210122446/http://ethiopia.usembassy.gov/pr0808.html|archive-date=10 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Difret'' received mixed reviews upon its premiere at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]]. Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', said in his review that \"'Difret' presents an important message, albeit in rather clunky narrative terms. More showing and less telling would have made this fact-inspired drama by Zeresenay Berhane Mehari as artistically compelling as it is informative. Still, fests and other outlets attracted to social-justice issues will queue up for this relatively rare export-ready Ethiopian feature.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance Film Review: \u2018Difret\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-difret-1201069956/|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> Boyd van Hoeij in his review for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film \"A quiet and powerful drama, based on a true story, that relies on familiar storytelling tropes.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Difret: Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/difret-sundance-review-674060|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> The film has a score of 58% on Metacritic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/difret|title=Difret|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n[[File:\"Difret\" Won the Audience Award for World Cinema Dramatic (12186030695).jpg|150px|thumb|upright|''Difret'' wins the Audience Award at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]].|left]]\n{{Anchor|Awards}} \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Most of the toys are a variety of foam-based weaponry, with other Nerf products including balls for sports like [[American football]], basketball and baseball. The most notable of the toys are the dart guns (referred to by Hasbro as \"blasters\") that shoot ammunition made from Nerf foam. Since many such items were released during the 1970s, Nerf products often feature bright neon colors and soft textures similar to the flagship Nerf ball. The slogan, which has been frequently used since advertising in the 1990s, is ''\"It's Nerf or Nothin'!\"''.

In Phantom Corps, the series has its own Nerf blasters, but also sports white reshells of some of the original red and blue blasters, which are altered slightly but are still recognizable as the originals. The Phantom Corps subline includes removable colored banners with the blasters so that the user can switch teams without having to buy a new blaster. A new series in 2019 will be the Nerf Rival Edge series, featuring a seemingly greater emphasis on the \u201cbolt-action sniper\u201d aesthetic and demographic\n\n====Nitro====\nIn 2017, Hasbro released the Nerf Nitro line, which consists of blasters that fire foam cars into obstacles and stunt ramps.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2017/01/27/nerf-nitro-shoots-cars-not-darts/#4a3b98897f88 |title='Nerf Nitro' Shoots Cars Not Darts |author=Robertson, Andy |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=2017-01-27 |accessdate=2017-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810212855/https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2017/01/27/nerf-nitro-shoots-cars-not-darts/#4a3b98897f88 |archive-date=2017-08-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Alpha Strike====\nIntroduced in August 2019, Nerf Alpha Strike is a blaster line priced lower than the standard N-Strike Elite line.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHC5OSpfNlw |title=Global Reveal - Nerf Alphastrike 2019 - All Blasters tested & variations shown! |first=Jared |last=Guynes |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=July 2, 2019 |accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Ultra====\nReleased in September 2019, Nerf Ultra (branded as ULTRA) blasters fire a new, propriety dart design that is marketed as \"THE FARTHEST FLYING DART.

This construction allows for fins to be molded into the rear of the darts.  Size-wise, Ultra darts are between N-Strike Elite darts and Mega darts in diameter, but shorter than both in length.  They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters. This design was created in response to the growing number of third-party darts, including exact knockoffs from China, available for N-Strike Elite blasters at a much lower cost than Nerf-brand darts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |title=Parents, Beware: Nerf\u2019s Newest Blasters Won\u2019t Fire Knockoff Darts |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2019-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |archive-date=2019-10-03 |url-status=live }}https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |date=2019-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe first blaster in the Ultra line was the Nerf Ultra ''One'', a drum-fed (25-dart capacity), flywheel design with integral (non-detachable) stock and fixed barrel with no N-Strike barrel attachments. It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front. Like the One, the Two comes in the same white, black and orange color scheme, and the \"ULTRA'\" label on the side. It is also the first electronic revolver-style blaster since the 2012 N-Strike Elite Stockade.\n\n===Nerf N-Force===\nThe N-Force line consisted of foam swords and melee weapons.

They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters.

It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front. Like the One, the Two comes in the same white, black and orange color scheme, and the \"ULTRA'\" label on the side.

Entered into the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057176/awards |title=IMDB.com: Awards for L'Immortelle |accessdate=14 February 2010 |work=imdb.com}}</ref> it also won the [[Prix Louis Delluc]].\n\nSet in [[Istanbul]], it tells the story of a withdrawn man falling hopelessly in love with an attractive and sexy woman who will not reveal her identity. While the two speak French to each other, the other characters mostly speak unsubtitled Turkish. Using a non-linear structure, intercut with memories and fantasies, neither the characters nor the viewers can be sure of what is portrayed and must reach their own understanding.\n\n==Plot==\nHaving taken a job in Istanbul, a melancholy Frenchman rents a flat overlooking the Bosphorus. He sets out to explore the city but, as he speaks only French, cannot communicate. He meets a beautiful and mysterious woman in a white convertible who speaks French as well as Turkish and is prepared to show him around. She is also ready to start a discreet affair. While they take in the sights of the city, often in deserted ruins and graveyards, they tend to be shadowed by sinister-looking men with one or more ferocious dogs. Then the woman disappears, and the Frenchman's obsession with her grows. Hunting for her all over, he finds the locals unhelpful, until he sees her one night in a crowded street. She rushes him away in her car, only to crash it as she tries to avoid one of the shadowing dogs. The Frenchman is scarcely harmed, but the woman is dead. Still obsessed with her memory, he starts a new quest to find out who she was, one possibility being a high-class prostitute. Once her car has been repaired, he buys it and crashes it on the same road, dying as well.\n\n==Production==\n[[Alain Robbe-Grillet]], who was one of the most successful screenwriters of the [[French New Wave]], longed to direct a feature film, but no offers of backing were forthcoming. At length, a Belgian producer agreed to let him direct a film from his own screenplay, on condition that the film be shot in Turkey, using \"blocked funds\" (profits from an earlier film that could not be taken out of the country) owed to Cocinor, the French production company. Robbe-Grillet accepted this, and in his first feature film as a director, created a dreamlike, erotic fantasy.\n\nRobbe-Grillet wrote a very detailed plan for the shooting, and wanted it followed in every detail. Both [[Fran\u00e7oise Brion]] and [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]] were friends of the director; though he had written the scenario with other actors in mind, he decided on them instead.<ref>Brion, F.

Thus, the film was almost impossible to see.

Entered into the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057176/awards |title=IMDB.com: Awards for L'Immortelle |accessdate=14 February 2010 |work=imdb.com}}</ref> it also won the [[Prix Louis Delluc]].\n\nSet in [[Istanbul]], it tells the story of a withdrawn man falling hopelessly in love with an attractive and sexy woman who will not reveal her identity. While the two speak French to each other, the other characters mostly speak unsubtitled Turkish. Using a non-linear structure, intercut with memories and fantasies, neither the characters nor the viewers can be sure of what is portrayed and must reach their own understanding.\n\n==Plot==\nHaving taken a job in Istanbul, a melancholy Frenchman rents a flat overlooking the Bosphorus. He sets out to explore the city but, as he speaks only French, cannot communicate. He meets a beautiful and mysterious woman in a white convertible who speaks French as well as Turkish and is prepared to show him around. She is also ready to start a discreet affair. While they take in the sights of the city, often in deserted ruins and graveyards, they tend to be shadowed by sinister-looking men with one or more ferocious dogs. Then the woman disappears, and the Frenchman's obsession with her grows. Hunting for her all over, he finds the locals unhelpful, until he sees her one night in a crowded street. She rushes him away in her car, only to crash it as she tries to avoid one of the shadowing dogs. The Frenchman is scarcely harmed, but the woman is dead. Still obsessed with her memory, he starts a new quest to find out who she was, one possibility being a high-class prostitute. Once her car has been repaired, he buys it and crashes it on the same road, dying as well.\n\n==Production==\n[[Alain Robbe-Grillet]], who was one of the most successful screenwriters of the [[French New Wave]], longed to direct a feature film, but no offers of backing were forthcoming. At length, a Belgian producer agreed to let him direct a film from his own screenplay, on condition that the film be shot in Turkey, using \"blocked funds\" (profits from an earlier film that could not be taken out of the country) owed to Cocinor, the French production company. Robbe-Grillet accepted this, and in his first feature film as a director, created a dreamlike, erotic fantasy.\n\nRobbe-Grillet wrote a very detailed plan for the shooting, and wanted it followed in every detail. Both [[Fran\u00e7oise Brion]] and [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]] were friends of the director; though he had written the scenario with other actors in mind, he decided on them instead.<ref>Brion, F.

Thus, the film was almost impossible to see.
