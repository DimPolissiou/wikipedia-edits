Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). On 18 March 2020, BBC made the decision to suspend production of the programme until further notice, in addition to reducing the broadcast frequency to two 30-minute episodes per week. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the reduced broadcast frequency being a temporary measure to preserve the ongoing broadcast of filmed episodes.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life.

Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring \"flash, trash, and melodrama\" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name=\"20years\" />\n\nOnce they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC.

This theme encompasses the whole Square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator [[Tony Holland]] was from a large East End family, and such families have typified ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"Insidestory p49\" /> The first central family was the combination of the [[Fowler family]], consisting of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), her husband [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] ([[Bill Treacher]]), and teenage children [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] ([[David Scarboro]]/[[Todd Carty]]) and [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] ([[Susan Tully]]). Pauline's family, the [[Beale family|Beales]], consisted of Pauline's twin brother [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]), his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and their teenage son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Pauline and Pete's domineering mother [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) lived with Pauline and her family. Holland drew on the names of his own family for the characters.<ref name=\"Insidestory p51-56\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|pp=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Watts family|Watts]] and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] families have been central to many notable ''EastEnders'' storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. In 2014, the [[Fowler family|Fowlers]] were revived and merged with the Slaters, with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) marrying [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). The Taylor family were introduced in 2017 and have been central to the show's main storylines. Key people involved in the production of ''EastEnders'' have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.<ref name=\"Insidestory p49\" />\n\n''EastEnders'' has an emphasis on strong family [[matriarch]]s, with examples including [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), helping to attract a female audience.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name=\"First10Years p143\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

Notably, from 1985 to 1988, author and television writer Hugh Miller wrote 17 novels, detailing the lives of many of the show's original characters before 1985, when events on screen took place.\n\nKate Lock also wrote four novels centred on more recent characters; [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]). Lock also wrote a character guide entitled ''Who's Who in EastEnders'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-55178-2}}) in 2000, examining main characters from the first 15 years of the show.\n\nShow creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland also wrote a book about the show in 1987, entitled ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-20601-9}}), telling the story of how the show made it to screen. Two special anniversary books have been written about the show; ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-37057-4}}) by Colin Brake in 1995 and ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-52165-5}}) by Rupert Smith in 2005.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Television|United Kingdom}}\n* [[East End of London in popular culture]]\n* [[List of soap operas]]\n* [[List of British television programmes]]\n* [[List of most-watched television broadcasts]]\n* [[List of television programmes broadcast by the BBC]]\n* [[List of programmes broadcast by RT\u00c9]]\n* [[List of programmes broadcast by TV3 Ireland]]\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Showcase]]\n* [[List of LGBT characters in soap operas]]\n* [[List of television shows set in London]]\n* [[List of television programs by episode count]]\n* [[List of television programs by name]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em|group=lower-greek}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n<!-- only book sources used to reference the article here -->\n* {{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Robert C |last2=Hill |first2=Annette |title=The television studies reader |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415283236 |oclc=846446529 |language=English |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Barker|first=Chris|title=Global television|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-631-20150-2|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barraclough|first1=John|title=EastEnders Special (1987 Annual)|date=1986|publisher=Grandreams|location=London|isbn=978-0-86227-384-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Brake|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Brake|title=EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|ref=harv|title-link=EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Buckingham|first1=David|title=Public Secrets: EastEnders and Its Audience|date=1987|publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI books]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-85170-210-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Christine|title=Women and Soap Opera: A Study of Prime-Time Soaps|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity Press]]|year=1991|isbn=978-0-7456-0489-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Kingsley|first1=Hilary|title=EastEnders handbook|date=1991|publisher=BBC Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Monroe|first1=Josephine|title=The Eastenders programme guide|date=1994|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=978-0-86369-825-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Slide|first1=Anthony|title=Some Joe you don't know : an American biographical guide to 100 British television personalities|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=|isbn=978-0-313-29550-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Julia|authorlink=Julia Smith|last2=Holland|first2=Tony|author2link=Tony Holland|title=EastEnders&nbsp;\u2013 The Inside Story|year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9|ref=harv|title-link=EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Rupert|title=EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square|publisher=BBC Books|year=2005|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{BBC Online|programmes/b006m86d|''EastEnders''}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040614/https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/eastenders/ ''EastEnders''] at [[BBC Studios]]\n* [https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/our-work/eastenders/ ''EastEnders''] at [[BBC Studioworks]]\n* {{tv.com show|eastenders|EastEnders}}\n* {{Bfidb series|id=7133|title=EastEnders}}\n* {{IMDb title|0088512}}\n* {{YouTube|user=eastenders|title=''EastEnders''|suffix='}}\n\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{EastEnders characters|state=collapsed}}\n{{Soap operas in the United Kingdom}}\n{{EastEnders: E20|state=collapsed}}\n{{BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Series 1998\u20132009}}\n\n[[Category:EastEnders| ]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:1990s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2000s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2010s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2020s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (television series)]]\n[[Category:BBC television dramas]]\n[[Category:BBC television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Social realism]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in London]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{Short description|British soap opera}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = EastEnders\n| image = EastEnders Title.png\n| image_alt = A satellite image of a city with a winding river in blue in the bottom half of the image.

Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). On 18 March 2020, BBC made the decision to suspend production of the programme until further notice, in addition to reducing the broadcast frequency to two 30-minute episodes per week. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the reduced broadcast frequency being a temporary measure to preserve the ongoing broadcast of filmed episodes.\n\nWithin eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top rated series in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013). \"Queer Love in Film and Television: Critical Essays\". p. 35.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.<ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]\", ''The Telegraph''.

However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach from ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: \"It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967\u201369)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe target launch date was originally January 1985.<ref name=\"Insidestory p24\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}</ref> Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing.

Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date.

Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring \"flash, trash, and melodrama\" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name=\"20years\" />\n\nOnce they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that ''EastEnders'' would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp\u2014set in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain\u2014and it would start with a bang (namely the death of [[Reg Cox]]). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, [[Nick Cotton]] was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray.<ref name=\"20years p20\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=20}}</ref> When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.\n\n==== Final preparations ====\n[[File:Eastendersearly.jpg|thumb|right|''EastEnders'' original titles sequence, 1985\u20131993|alt=refer to caption]]\nThrough the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence.

The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. In 2014, the [[Fowler family|Fowlers]] were revived and merged with the Slaters, with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) marrying [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]).

He classed 1989's changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility.<ref name=\"First10Years p70\" /> Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between \"light and heavy storylines\" gave the illusion that the show had lost a \"certain edge\".<ref name=\"First10Years p70\" />\n\nAs the show progressed into the 1990s, ''EastEnders'' still featured hard-hitting issues such as [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) revealing he was [[HIV]] positive<ref name=\"issues\" /> in 1991, the death of his wife [[Gill Fowler|Gill]] (Susanna Dawson) from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, [[adoption]], [[abortion]], [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) battle with [[breast cancer]],<ref name=\"issues\" /> and [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name=\"First10Years p143\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

Notably, from 1985 to 1988, author and television writer Hugh Miller wrote 17 novels, detailing the lives of many of the show's original characters before 1985, when events on screen took place.\n\nKate Lock also wrote four novels centred on more recent characters; [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]). Lock also wrote a character guide entitled ''Who's Who in EastEnders'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-55178-2}}) in 2000, examining main characters from the first 15 years of the show.\n\nShow creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland also wrote a book about the show in 1987, entitled ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-20601-9}}), telling the story of how the show made it to screen. Two special anniversary books have been written about the show; ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-37057-4}}) by Colin Brake in 1995 and ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-52165-5}}) by Rupert Smith in 2005.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Television|United Kingdom}}\n* [[East End of London in popular culture]]\n* [[List of soap operas]]\n* [[List of British television programmes]]\n* [[List of most-watched television broadcasts]]\n* [[List of television programmes broadcast by the BBC]]\n* [[List of programmes broadcast by RT\u00c9]]\n* [[List of programmes broadcast by TV3 Ireland]]\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Showcase]]\n* [[List of LGBT characters in soap operas]]\n* [[List of television shows set in London]]\n* [[List of television programs by episode count]]\n* [[List of television programs by name]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em|group=lower-greek}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n<!-- only book sources used to reference the article here -->\n* {{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Robert C |last2=Hill |first2=Annette |title=The television studies reader |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415283236 |oclc=846446529 |language=English |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Barker|first=Chris|title=Global television|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-631-20150-2|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barraclough|first1=John|title=EastEnders Special (1987 Annual)|date=1986|publisher=Grandreams|location=London|isbn=978-0-86227-384-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Brake|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Brake|title=EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|ref=harv|title-link=EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Buckingham|first1=David|title=Public Secrets: EastEnders and Its Audience|date=1987|publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI books]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-85170-210-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Christine|title=Women and Soap Opera: A Study of Prime-Time Soaps|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity Press]]|year=1991|isbn=978-0-7456-0489-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Kingsley|first1=Hilary|title=EastEnders handbook|date=1991|publisher=BBC Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Monroe|first1=Josephine|title=The Eastenders programme guide|date=1994|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=978-0-86369-825-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Slide|first1=Anthony|title=Some Joe you don't know : an American biographical guide to 100 British television personalities|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=|isbn=978-0-313-29550-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Julia|authorlink=Julia Smith|last2=Holland|first2=Tony|author2link=Tony Holland|title=EastEnders&nbsp;\u2013 The Inside Story|year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9|ref=harv|title-link=EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Rupert|title=EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square|publisher=BBC Books|year=2005|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{BBC Online|programmes/b006m86d|''EastEnders''}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040614/https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/eastenders/ ''EastEnders''] at [[BBC Studios]]\n* [https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/our-work/eastenders/ ''EastEnders''] at [[BBC Studioworks]]\n* {{tv.com show|eastenders|EastEnders}}\n* {{Bfidb series|id=7133|title=EastEnders}}\n* {{IMDb title|0088512}}\n* {{YouTube|user=eastenders|title=''EastEnders''|suffix='}}\n\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{EastEnders characters|state=collapsed}}\n{{Soap operas in the United Kingdom}}\n{{EastEnders: E20|state=collapsed}}\n{{BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Series 1998\u20132009}}\n\n[[Category:EastEnders| ]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:1990s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2000s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2010s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2020s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (television series)]]\n[[Category:BBC television dramas]]\n[[Category:BBC television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Social realism]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in London]]\n", "name_user": "Test Card Gold", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EastEnders"}

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the [[Allies (World War II)|Allied side]], administered by the [[Belgian government in exile]], and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably [[uranium]], to the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCongolese troops of the [[Force Publique]] fought alongside British forces in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], and a Congolese medical unit served in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and in the [[Burma Campaign]]. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nThe increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Battle of Belgium|German occupation of Belgium during World War II}}\n[[File:Monument Albert Kinshasa 5.JPG|thumb|Colonial officials, including the Governor-General, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]], in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] in 1938.]]\n\nFollowing World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the [[Belgian Congo]], which it had controlled since its annexation of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908, and [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]].<ref name=Larousse1>{{cite web|title=Empire Colonial Belge|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Empire_colonial_belge/182725|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions Larousse]]|work=Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time.<ref name=Killingray7>{{cite book|last=Killingray|first=David|title=Fighting for Britain: African soldiers in the Second World War|year=2010|publisher=James Currey|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1-84701-015-5|page=7}}</ref> The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The [[Great Depression]] led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]], the Congolese capital.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=122}} On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The [[Admiralty]] proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \"independent\" Congo.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nWithin the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the he [[List of colonial governors of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo|Governor-General of the Congo]], [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Ryckmans refused to take this advice,{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=127}} and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref name=Urome>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=L'Histoire du Congo vue par les Coloniaux|publisher=Urome.be|url=http://www.urome.be/pdf/fhisconbe.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOn 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72, 231}} Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]] believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=72\u201373}} Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \"Kolonial Politisches B\u00fcro\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nThe British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like [[natural rubber|rubber]] which the Congo could produce in abundance.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=81}} On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|p=231}} Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}}  The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=123, 132}}\n\nDe Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=73\u201374, 232}} He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the [[Belgian government in exile]], recognised by the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=232\u2013233}} Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister [[Camille Gutt]] and played little role thereafter in the government.{{sfn|Van der Wee|Verbreyt|2009|pp=237\u2013238}} There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony.{{sfn|Veranneman|2014|p=131}}\n\nThe Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=128}} Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] to dispatch an emissary to L\u00e9opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\n==Economic contribution==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"The Belgian Congo has entered the service of the Allies.

See, for example,\n{{cite book | title= From Eudoxus to Einstein \u2013 A History of Mathematical Astronomy\n | author= Linton, Christopher M.\n | publisher= Cambridge University Press\n | date= 2004\n | location= Cambridge\n | page= 225\n | isbn= 978-0-521-82750-8\n | ref= Linton-2004}}\n</ref> The equation is the following:\n\n<math>F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\ </math>\n\nWhere ''F'' is the force, ''m<sub>1</sub>'' and ''m<sub>2</sub>'' are the masses of the objects interacting, ''r'' is the distance between the centers of the masses and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to the discovery of Neptune.\n\nA discrepancy in [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by [[Albert Einstein]]'s new theory of [[general relativity]], which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit. This discrepancy was the advance in the perihelion of Mercury of 42.98 arcseconds per century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nobil|first=Anna M.|date=March 1986|title=The real value of Mercury's perihelion advance|journal=Nature|volume=320|issue=6057|pages=39\u201341|bibcode=1986Natur.320...39N|doi=10.1038/320039a0}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Newton's theory has been superseded by [[Einstein]]'s general relativity, most modern [[Theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] gravitational calculations are still made using Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies.\n\n===Equivalence principle===\nThe [[equivalence principle]], explored by a succession of researchers including Galileo, [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], and Einstein, expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way, and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration.  The simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time. Such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible. More sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s.

The starting point for general relativity is the [[equivalence principle]], which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |title=Gravity and Warped Spacetime |publisher=black-holes.org |accessdate=16 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621005940/http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lecture 20: Black Holes \u2013 The Einstein Equivalence Principle |author=Dmitri Pogosyan |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> In [[Newtonian physics]], however, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force.\n\nEinstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]]. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic.  For instance, we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.\n\nEinstein discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him. The [[Einstein field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equations|simultaneous]], [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\n====Solutions====\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[Circular symmetry|spherically symmetric]] non-[[rotation|rotating]] uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a [[black hole]] with a central [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. For radial distances from the center which are much greater than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with double [[event horizon]]s.\n* The [[Kerr metric|Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.\n* The [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric|Kerr-Newman solution]] for charged, rotating massive objects.

(Linked file is very large.)</ref>\n\nAssuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this means that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s or 22&nbsp;mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62&nbsp;m/s (64.4&nbsp;ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same height, will hit the ground at the same time.\n\nAccording to [[Newton's 3rd law|Newton's 3rd Law]], the Earth itself experiences a [[Newtons|force]] equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object.  This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide.  Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the acceleration imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the object's.  If the object does not bounce after it has collided with the Earth, each of them then exerts a repulsive [[contact force]] on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration.\n\nThe force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1 = B.\n|last2 = Moritz |first2 = H.\n|title = Physical Geodesy\n|publisher = Springer\n|edition = 2nd\n|isbn = 978-3-211-33544-4\n|year = 2006\n|postscript = . \u00a7 2.1: \"The total force acting on a body at rest on the earth's surface is the resultant of gravitational force and the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation and is called gravity\".\n}}</ref> (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference.  The force of gravity is weakest at the equator because of the [[centrifugal force]] caused by the Earth's rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth.  The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> at the Equator to about 9.832&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> at the poles.\n\n===Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth===\n{{main|Equations for a falling body}}\nUnder an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] simplifies to ''F'' = ''mg'', where ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the body and ''g'' is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> on Earth. This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this ''g''. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first {{frac|20}} of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12&nbsp;mm); by {{frac|2|20}} it has dropped at total of 4 units; by {{frac|3|20}}, 9 units and so on.\n\nUnder the same constant gravity assumptions, the [[potential energy]], ''E''<sub>p</sub>, of a body at height ''h'' is given by ''E''<sub>p</sub> = ''mgh'' (or ''E''<sub>p</sub> = ''Wh'', with ''W'' meaning weight). This expression is valid only over small distances ''h'' from the surface of the Earth.

Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its [[orbit]] because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic centers]], galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in [[supercluster]]s.

Any accelerating matter can create curvatures in the space-time metric, which is how the gravitational radiation is transported away from the system. Co-orbiting objects can generate curvatures in space-time such as the Earth-Sun system, pairs of neutron stars, and pairs of black holes. Another astrophysical system predicted to lose energy in the form of gravitational radiation are exploding supernovae.\n\nThe first indirect evidence for gravitational radiation was through measurements of the [[Hulse\u2013Taylor binary]] in 1973. This system consists of a pulsar and neutron star in orbit around one another. Its orbital period has decreased since its initial discovery due to a loss of energy, which is consistent for the amount of energy loss due to gravitational radiation. This research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993. \n\nThe first direct evidence for gravitational radiation was measured on 14 September 2015 by the [[LIGO]] detectors.

However, he also dismissed the idea that any such force did exist.

Calculations by both [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to the discovery of Neptune.\n\nA discrepancy in [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by [[Albert Einstein]]'s new theory of [[general relativity]], which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit. This discrepancy was the advance in the perihelion of Mercury of 42.98 arcseconds per century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nobil|first=Anna M.|date=March 1986|title=The real value of Mercury's perihelion advance|journal=Nature|volume=320|issue=6057|pages=39\u201341|bibcode=1986Natur.320...39N|doi=10.1038/320039a0}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Newton's theory has been superseded by [[Einstein]]'s general relativity, most modern [[Theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] gravitational calculations are still made using Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies.\n\n===Equivalence principle===\nThe [[equivalence principle]], explored by a succession of researchers including Galileo, [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], and Einstein, expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way, and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration.  The simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time. Such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible.

The starting point for general relativity is the [[equivalence principle]], which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |title=Gravity and Warped Spacetime |publisher=black-holes.org |accessdate=16 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621005940/http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lecture 20: Black Holes \u2013 The Einstein Equivalence Principle |author=Dmitri Pogosyan |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> In [[Newtonian physics]], however, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force.\n\nEinstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]]. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic.  For instance, we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.\n\nEinstein discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him. The [[Einstein field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equations|simultaneous]], [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\n====Solutions====\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[Circular symmetry|spherically symmetric]] non-[[rotation|rotating]] uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a [[black hole]] with a central [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. For radial distances from the center which are much greater than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with double [[event horizon]]s.\n* The [[Kerr metric|Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.\n* The [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric|Kerr-Newman solution]] for charged, rotating massive objects.

General relativity describes large-scale bulk properties whereas quantum mechanics is the framework to describe the smallest scale interactions of matter.

(Linked file is very large.)</ref>\n\nAssuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this means that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s or 22&nbsp;mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62&nbsp;m/s (64.4&nbsp;ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same height, will hit the ground at the same time.\n\nAccording to [[Newton's 3rd law|Newton's 3rd Law]], the Earth itself experiences a [[Newtons|force]] equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object.  This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide.  Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the acceleration imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the object's.  If the object does not bounce after it has collided with the Earth, each of them then exerts a repulsive [[contact force]] on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration.\n\nThe force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1 = B.\n|last2 = Moritz |first2 = H.\n|title = Physical Geodesy\n|publisher = Springer\n|edition = 2nd\n|isbn = 978-3-211-33544-4\n|year = 2006\n|postscript = . \u00a7 2.1: \"The total force acting on a body at rest on the earth's surface is the resultant of gravitational force and the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation and is called gravity\".\n}}</ref> (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference.  The force of gravity is weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth.  The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> at the Equator to about 9.832&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> at the poles.\n\n===Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth===\n{{main|Equations for a falling body}}\nUnder an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] simplifies to ''F'' = ''mg'', where ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the body and ''g'' is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> on Earth. This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this ''g''. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first {{frac|20}} of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12&nbsp;mm); by {{frac|2|20}} it has dropped at total of 4 units; by {{frac|3|20}}, 9 units and so on.\n\nUnder the same constant gravity assumptions, the [[potential energy]], ''E''<sub>p</sub>, of a body at height ''h'' is given by ''E''<sub>p</sub> = ''mgh'' (or ''E''<sub>p</sub> = ''Wh'', with ''W'' meaning weight). This expression is valid only over small distances ''h'' from the surface of the Earth. Similarly, the expression <math>h = \\tfrac{v^2}{2g}</math> for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity ''v'' is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only.\n\n{{clr}}\n\n===Gravity and astronomy===\n[[File:Milky Way Emerges as Sun Sets over Paranal.jpg|thumb|right|Gravity acts on stars that form the [[Milky Way]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Milky Way Emerges as Sun Sets over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1517a/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Obseevatory|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>]]\nThe application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of [[quasar]]s; even the existence of [[dark matter]] is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its [[orbit]] because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic centers]], galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in [[supercluster]]s.

Any accelerating matter can create curvatures in the space-time metric, which is how the gravitational radiation is transported away from the system. Co-orbiting objects can generate curvatures in space-time such as the Earth-Sun system, pairs of neutron stars, and pairs of black holes. Another astrophysical system predicted to lose energy in the form of gravitational radiation are exploding supernovae.\n\nThe first indirect evidence for gravitational radiation was through measurements of the [[Hulse\u2013Taylor binary]] in 1973. This system consists of a pulsar and neutron star in orbit around one another. Its orbital period has decreased since its initial discovery due to a loss of energy, which is consistent for the amount of energy loss due to gravitational radiation. This research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993. \n\nThe first direct evidence for gravitational radiation was measured on 14 September 2015 by the [[LIGO]] detectors.

He traveled with the Yankees for [[spring training]] to view his signees playing baseball. When the Yankees traveled north to begin their season, Krichell usually followed.<ref name=\"Eig, 38\"/> He also scouted the local newspapers to look for games in which potential prospects were playing.<ref name=\"Eig, 39\"/>\n\nLater, his style of scouting was used as a blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as [[batting (baseball)|ability to hit]], size, speed, and [[human power]], saying that \"any dope\" could see it.<ref name=mainsource/> When he scouted a prospect, his top priority was checking that the subject could handle the pressure of playing [[Major League Baseball]].<ref name=\"Voigt 177\">Voigt, p. 177</ref> When he got word of a promising player, he went to see him play. If Krichell liked what he saw, he discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family.<ref name=mainsource/> He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their [[farm team]]s to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams.<ref name=\"Berger 99\">Berger, p. 99</ref> He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with [[Tony Lazzeri]], who was a poor [[fielding (baseball)|fielder]].<ref name=mainsource/> Krichell also was one of the first to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.<ref name=\"Graham 141\">Graham, p. 141</ref>\n\nAt other times, Krichell collected some of the best [[amateur baseball in the United States|prospects]] in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon.<ref>Madden, p. 5</ref> There, Krichell and his staff sorted through players they believed could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation.

He traveled with the Yankees for [[spring training]] to view his signees playing baseball. When the Yankees traveled north to begin their season, Krichell usually followed.<ref name=\"Eig, 38\"/> He also scouted the local newspapers to look for games in which potential prospects were playing.<ref name=\"Eig, 39\"/>\n\nLater, his style of scouting was used as a blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as [[batting (baseball)|ability to hit]], size, speed, and [[human power]], saying that \"any dope\" could see it.<ref name=mainsource/> When he scouted a prospect, his top priority was checking that the subject could handle the pressure of playing [[Major League Baseball]].<ref name=\"Voigt 177\">Voigt, p. 177</ref> When he got word of a promising player, he went to see him play. If Krichell liked what he saw, he discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family.<ref name=mainsource/> He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their [[farm team]]s to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams.<ref name=\"Berger 99\">Berger, p. 99</ref> He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with [[Tony Lazzeri]], who was a poor [[fielding (baseball)|fielder]].<ref name=mainsource/> Krichell also was one of the first to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.<ref name=\"Graham 141\">Graham, p. 141</ref>\n\nAt other times, Krichell collected some of the best [[amateur baseball in the United States|prospects]] in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon.<ref>Madden, p. 5</ref> There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players they believed could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation.

When hostilities began, ''Richmond'', HM ships {{HMS|Chatham|F87|2}}, {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|2}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|FFH 150|6}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the [[Royal Marines]]' [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening attack|amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula]], the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. ''Richmond'' remained in the region at the war's end and returned home in August.\n\nIn July 2004, under the command of Commander [[Mike McCartain]], ''Richmond'' deployed on [[Atlantic Patrol Task (North)]], which encompasses the Atlantic and [[Caribbean]] regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were [[Jamaica]] and [[Belize]]. In September ''Richmond'' came to the assistance of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] when they were struck by [[Hurricane Frances]].  Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. ''Richmond'' then sailed to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of [[Hurricane Ivan]].\n\nHurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to [[Grenada]], which included immense damage to the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. ''Richmond'' and her accompanying [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel {{ship|RFA|Wave Ruler|A390|2}} came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that [[Keith Mitchell]], Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to ''Richmond'' after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from ''Richmond'' for several hours.\n\nHer crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, ''Richmond'' steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.\n\n''Richmond'' returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Naval Base Portsmouth]] in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by [[Fleet Support Limited]], was completed in late 2006 and ''Richmond'' was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006.

When hostilities began, ''Richmond'', HM ships {{HMS|Chatham|F87|2}}, {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|2}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|FFH 150|6}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the [[Royal Marines]]' [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening attack|amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula]], the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. ''Richmond'' remained in the region at the war's end and returned home in August.\n\nIn July 2004, under the command of Commander [[Mike McCartain]], ''Richmond'' deployed on [[Atlantic Patrol Task (North)]], which encompasses the Atlantic and [[Caribbean]] regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were [[Jamaica]] and [[Belize]]. In September ''Richmond'' came to the assistance of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] when they were struck by [[Hurricane Frances]].  Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. ''Richmond'' then sailed to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of [[Hurricane Ivan]].\n\nHurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to [[Grenada]], which included immense damage to the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. ''Richmond'' and her accompanying [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel {{ship|RFA|Wave Ruler|A390|2}} came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that [[Keith Mitchell]], Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to ''Richmond'' after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from ''Richmond'' for several hours.\n\nHer crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, ''Richmond'' steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.\n\n''Richmond'' returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Naval Base Portsmouth]] in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by [[Fleet Support Limited]], was completed in late 2006 and ''Richmond'' was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006. With 44 major upgrades to her sensor and weapon systems, ''Richmond'' was at that time one of the most capable Type 23 frigates.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |title=Fresh-faced ''Richmond'' re-dedicated to the Fleet |date=December 2006 |magazine=firstBASE |page=7 |publisher=[[HMNB Portsmouth]] |access-date=3 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809192438/http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2007}}</ref> From 5 to 12 July 2010 she anchored beside {{HMS|Belfast||6}} in London to foster the ship's relations with the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4659 |title=HMS ''Richmond'' arrives in the Pool of London |date=5 July 2010 |website=London SE1 |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2011\u2013present===\n[[File:HMS Richmond at South Quay.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Richmond'' moored at South Quay in London in 2017]]\nIn 2011, she deployed to the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, the latter for upcoming [[Five Power Defence Arrangement]] exercises, specifically Exercise Bersama Shield 11.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1215-richmond-enjoys-some-happy-torque-in-the-far-east.aspx |title=''Richmond'' enjoys some happy torque in the Far East |newspaper=[[Navy News]]}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> She assisted with anti-piracy operations with the EU Naval Force and was also a participant in the IMEX Asia 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/HmsRichmondDeploysOnCounterpiracyMission.htm |author=Ministry of Defence |title=HMS ''Richmond'' deploys on counter-piracy mission  |date=5 January 2011 |website=[[Gov.uk]] |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |title=Navy Takes On Pirates (Real Ones) |date=10 May 2011 |website=Cornwall Community News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134031/http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref> After Singapore, she rendered honours to the fallen of [[Force Z]] (see the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|Sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1203-richmond-honours-the-dead-of-force-z.aspx |title=''Richmond'' honours the dead of Force Z |newspaper=Navy News}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\nShe took part in exercise FRUKUS 2011 with ships from the [[United States Navy]] and [[Russian Navy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |title=Russian warship heads out for joint maneuvers |date=1 June 2011 |website=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |access-date=1 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906022428/http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |archive-date=6 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn early August 2013, she deployed under the command of Commander Robert G.

The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.\n:2. {{note|b}} In 2009, Croatia qualified through the back-up jury selection. \n:3. If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. If, for example, Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the countries who placed 11th and 12th were advanced to the following year's grand final along with the rest of the top ten countries. Serbia & Montenegro decided to withdraw from the competition even tho they finished in the top ten the previous year, so the country that placed 11th (which was Croatia) got the spot in the final instead.</small>\n\n==Awards==\n===Barbara Dex Award===\n{{further|Barbara Dex Award}}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Host city\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{Escyr|2016}}\n|[[Nina Kralji\u0107]]\n|{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Stockholm]]\n|{{center|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2016/05/22/barbara-dex-award-2016-nina-kraljic-wins-eurovisions-worst-dressed/142524/|title=Barbara Dex Award 2016: Croatia\u2019s Nina Kraljic tops Eurovision\u2019s Worst Dressed list|publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]]|date=22 May 2016|accessdate=8 December 2019|first=William Lee|last=Adams}}</ref>}}\n|}\n\n==Related involvement==\n===Heads of delegation===\nThe public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event.

The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.\n:2. {{note|b}} In 2009, Croatia qualified through the back-up jury selection. \n:3. If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year.
