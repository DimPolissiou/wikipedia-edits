The decade was also labeled the [[Swinging London|Swinging Sixties]] because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time, but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music; from a folk music revival, to the Beatles revolution, to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Norms of all kinds were broken down, especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars.\n\nCommentator [[Christopher Booker]]<ref>[[Christopher Booker]]: ''The Neophiliacs:  A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties'', Gambit Incorporated, London, 1970</ref> described this era as a classical [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater [[Individualism|individual freedom]], broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several [[Western culture|Western]] nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] turned to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] in the early and mid-1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\n\nThe [[Cold War|confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union]] dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global [[superpower]] and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by [[proxy war]]s, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\n\nIn response to [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] campaigns from groups like the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), U.S. President [[John F.

Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under [[Lyndon B.

Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] outraged student protestors around the globe.  The [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] upon working with underpaid [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|Tennessee garbage collectors]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]], and [[Chicago Seven|the police response towards protesters of the 1968 Democratic National Convention]], defined politics of violence in the United States.\n\nIn Western Europe and Japan, organizations such as [[Situationist International|those present at May 1968]], the [[Red Army Faction]], and the [[Zengakuren]] tested [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracy's]] ability to satisfy its marginalized or alienated citizenry amidst [[Advanced capitalism|post-industrial age hybrid capitalist economies]].

Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], [[West Bengal]], led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in August 1966 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was able to forge a connection. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 in France|May]] student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed capable of overthrowing the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. De Gaulle went off to visit French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.\n* University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.\n* In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West. In Poland and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] they protested against restrictions on free speech by [[communist]] regimes.\n* The [[Tlatelolco massacre]] \u2013 was a government massacre of student and civilian protesters and bystanders that took place during the afternoon and night of 2 October 1968, in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] section of Mexico City.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1960\u20131969}}\nProminent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade included:\n* On 27 May 1960, a coup in [[Turkey]] led by [[Cemal G\u00fcrsel]] and [[Cemal Madano\u011flu]] overthrew the government of [[Adnan Menderes]].\n* On 16 May 1961, a coup in [[South Korea]] led by army officer [[Park Chung-hee]] made the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* In 1963, a coup in [[South Viet Nam]] leads to the death of President [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] and the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* On 21 April 1967, in Greece a group of colonels established a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military dictatorship]] for seven years.\n* In 1968, a coup in Iraq led to the overthrow of [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] by the [[Arab socialism|Arab Socialist]] [[Baath Party]].\n* On 1 September 1969, a small group of military officers led by the army officer [[Muammar Gaddafi]] overthrows monarchy in [[Libya]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|150px|Pictures of Soviet missile silos in [[Cuba]], taken by United States spy planes on 1 November 1962.]]\n* The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) \u2013 a near-military confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union about the presence of Soviet missiles in [[Cuba]].

President Kennedy had plans to restore Sino-US relations, but his assassination, the war in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution put an end to that. Not until Richard Nixon took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n* Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S., as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]].

To do this, he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment.

This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\".  Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American|black American]]s and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolent action|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included [[boycott]]s such as the successful [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955\u20131956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the [[Southwestern United States]], such as [[California]] with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>[http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html History | LULAC-League of United Latin American Citizens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling which declared that segregating children of \"Mexican and Latin descent\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 ''[[Hernandez v.

The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in [[Miami, Florida]].\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.  A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.  These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality.  This philosophy would be dominant again after [[AIDS]], but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close.  Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.  Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.  On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.  This uprising called the [[Stonewall Riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf U.S. Census Bureau Data https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n\n===Science===\n\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968 the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September, 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, [[Apollo 11]], the [[Moon landing|first human spaceflight landed on the Moon]]. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and the Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.\n\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 - The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 - The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 \u2013 [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 \u2013 First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 \u2013 Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n\n===Technology===\n\n====Automobiles====\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 \u2013 [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 \u2013 [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 \u2013 First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 \u2013 The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 \u2013 Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 \u2013 The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], '''[[Syncom 2]]''' is launched.\n* 1963 \u2013 First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 \u2013 The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 \u2013 [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 \u2013 The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 \u2013 [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 \u2013 The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 \u2013 [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 \u2013 The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], [[email]], and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Arpanet]], the research-oriented prototype of the [[Internet]], was introduced.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n* The [[Manson Murders]] occurred between 8\u201310 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] & [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During the anniversary celebrations, French president [[Charles De Gaulle]] visited Canada, and caused a considerable uproar by declaring his support for Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois independence.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco in 1967, and the [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[upstate New York]] in 1969. [[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The arrival of the [[Beatles]] in the US during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the US]]\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The 60's{{sic}} were a leap in human consciousness.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], and many other [[singer-songwriters]] to the public.\n\n[[Girl group]]s and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], the [[The Dixie Cups|Dixie Cups]], the [[Ronettes]], and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were [[African-American]], but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], the [[The Angels (American group)|Angels]], and the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las]] also emerged during  this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early '60s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 60s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]],\" \"[[409 (song)|409]],\" and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]],\" all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]],\" [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]],\" and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[traffic accident]]s. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]],\" [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]],\" [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve]],\" the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las']] \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" and [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers']] \"[[Last Kiss]].\"\n\nWhile rock 'n' roll had \"disappeared\" from the U.S. charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a 2-1/2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in prior decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n'''Significant events in music in the 1960s:'''\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8\u00bd]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jet\u00e9e]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of light-weight and affordable cameras, the underground [[New American Cinema|avant-garde film]] movement thrived. Canada's [[Michael Snow]], Americans [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]. Notable films in this genre are: ''[[Dog Star Man]]''; ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]''; ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]''; ''[[Chelsea Girls]]''; ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]''; ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]''; ''[[Flaming Creatures]]''.\n\nAside of [[Walt Disney]]'s most important blockbusters ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', Animated feature films which are of notable status include ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'', ''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'', ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.\n\n\n====Significant events in the film industry in the 1960s====\n\n*Removal of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[Production Code]] in 1967.\n*The decline and end of the [[Studio system|Studio System]].\n*The rise of \"[[art house]]\" films and theaters.\n*The end of the [[classical hollywood cinema]] era.\n*The beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] Era due to the counterculture.\n*The rise of independent producers that worked outside the Studio System.\n*Move to all-color production in Hollywood films.\n*The invention of the [[Nagra]] 1/4\", sync-sound, portable open-reel tape deck.\n*[[Expo 67]] where new film formats like [[Imax]] were invented and new ways of displaying film were tested.\n*Flat-bed film editing tables appear, like the [[Steenbeck]], they eventually replace the [[Moviola]] editing platform.\n*The [[French New Wave]].\n*[[Direct Cinema]] and [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentaries.\n*The beginning of the [[Golden Age of Porn]] in 1969, which continued throughout the 1970s and into the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1960s in television}}\nThe most prominent American TV series of the 1960s include: ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]], [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. ''The Flintstones'' was a favoured show, receiving 420 million views an episode with an average of 69 million views a day.  Some programming such as ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls; making fun of world leaders, and questioning U.S. involvement in and escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n[[Walt Disney]], the founder of the [[Walt Disney Co.]] died on 15 December 1966, from a major tumor in his left lung.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1960s in fashion}}\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\n* [[The Beatles]] exerted an enormous influence on young men's fashions and hairstyles in the 1960s which included most notably the [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], the [[Beatle boots]] and the [[Nehru jacket]].\n* The [[hippie]] movement late in the decade also had a strong influence on clothing styles, including [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom jeans]], [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] fabrics, as well as [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] prints.\n* The [[bikini]] came into fashion in 1963 after being featured in the film ''[[Beach Party]]''.\n* [[Mary Quant]] invented the [[miniskirt]], which became one of the most popular fashion rages in the late 1960s among young women and teenage girls. Its popularity continued throughout the first half of the 1970s and then disappeared temporarily from mainstream fashion before making a comeback in the mid-1980s.\n* Men's mainstream hairstyles ranged from the [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], the [[crew cut]], the [[flattop]] hairstyle, the tapered hairstyle, and short, parted hair in the early part of the decade, to longer parted hairstyles with [[sideburns]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* Women's mainstream hairstyles ranged from [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], the bird's nest hairstyle, and the [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] hairstyle in the early part of the decade, to very short styles popularized by [[Twiggy]] and [[Mia Farrow]] in [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* African-American hairstyles for men and women included the [[afro]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Mop-top hair.jpg|The [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], which became popular due to the Beatles but was considered at the time a rebellious hairstyle, was particularly fashionable among young men during the decade\nFile:On the Beach at Tiberias.jpg|The [[bikini]] became a fashionable item in the Western world during the decade\nFile:Londons_Carnaby_Street,_1966.jpg|\"Swinging London\" fashions on [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1966\nFile:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|[[Tie-dye]] shirt\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also|List of years in literature#1960s}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Olympics====\nThere were six [[Olympic Games]] held during the decade.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant.

The decade was also labeled the [[Swinging London|Swinging Sixties]] because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time, but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music; from a folk music revival, to the Beatles revolution, to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Norms of all kinds were broken down, especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars.\n\nCommentator [[Christopher Booker]]<ref>[[Christopher Booker]]: ''The Neophiliacs:  A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties'', Gambit Incorporated, London, 1970</ref> described this era as a classical [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater [[Individualism|individual freedom]], broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several [[Western culture|Western]] nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] turned to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] in the early and mid-1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\n\nThe [[Cold War|confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union]] dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global [[superpower]] and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by [[proxy war]]s, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\n\nIn response to [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] campaigns from groups like the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-7,00.html|title=The Economy: We Are All Keynesians Now|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=1 January 2011|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|quote=Keynesianism made its biggest breakthrough under John Kennedy, who, as Arthur Schlesinger reports in A Thousand Days, \"was unquestionably the first Keynesian President.\"}}</ref> and staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], pushed for social reforms.  Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] including civil rights for [[African Americans]] and healthcare for [[Medicare (United States)|the elderly]] and [[Medicaid|the poor]]. Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] outraged student protestors around the globe.  The [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] upon working with underpaid [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|Tennessee garbage collectors]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]], and [[Chicago Seven|the police response towards protesters of the 1968 Democratic National Convention]], defined politics of violence in the United States.\n\nIn Western Europe and Japan, organizations such as [[Situationist International|those present at May 1968]], the [[Red Army Faction]], and the [[Zengakuren]] tested [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracy's]] ability to satisfy its marginalized or alienated citizenry amidst [[Advanced capitalism|post-industrial age hybrid capitalist economies]].

Mao alleged that \"liberal bourgeois\" elements were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore [[capitalism]]. Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], [[West Bengal]], led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in August 1966 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was able to forge a connection. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 in France|May]] student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed capable of overthrowing the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. De Gaulle went off to visit French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.\n* University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.\n* In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West. In Poland and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] they protested against restrictions on free speech by [[communist]] regimes.\n* The [[Tlatelolco massacre]] \u2013 was a government massacre of student and civilian protesters and bystanders that took place during the afternoon and night of 2 October 1968, in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] section of Mexico City.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1960\u20131969}}\nProminent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade included:\n* On 27 May 1960, a coup in [[Turkey]] led by [[Cemal G\u00fcrsel]] and [[Cemal Madano\u011flu]] overthrew the government of [[Adnan Menderes]].\n* On 16 May 1961, a coup in [[South Korea]] led by army officer [[Park Chung-hee]] made the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* In 1963, a coup in [[South Viet Nam]] leads to the death of President [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] and the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* On 21 April 1967, in Greece a group of colonels established a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military dictatorship]] for seven years.\n* In 1968, a coup in Iraq led to the overthrow of [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] by the [[Arab socialism|Arab Socialist]] [[Baath Party]].\n* On 1 September 1969, a small group of military officers led by the army officer [[Muammar Gaddafi]] overthrows monarchy in [[Libya]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|150px|Pictures of Soviet missile silos in [[Cuba]], taken by United States spy planes on 1 November 1962.]]\n* The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) \u2013 a near-military confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union about the presence of Soviet missiles in [[Cuba]].

President Kennedy had plans to restore Sino-US relations, but his assassination, the war in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution put an end to that. Not until Richard Nixon took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n* Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S., as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]].

To do this, he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment.

This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\".  Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American|black American]]s and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolent action|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included [[boycott]]s such as the successful [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955\u20131956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the [[Southwestern United States]], such as [[California]] with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>[http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html History | LULAC-League of United Latin American Citizens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling which declared that segregating children of \"Mexican and Latin descent\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 ''[[Hernandez v. Texas]]'' ruling which declared that Mexican Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=432|title=LatinoLA \u2013 Hollywood :: Mendez v.

Texas \u2013 The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|work=oyez.org}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF), was founded in 1968.<ref>[http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm MALDEF{{spaced ndash}} About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422002948/http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Although modeled after the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality and socioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states. The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in [[Miami, Florida]].\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.  A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.  These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality.  This philosophy would be dominant again after [[AIDS]], but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close.  Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.  Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.  On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.  This uprising called the [[Stonewall Riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf U.S. Census Bureau Data https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n\n===Science===\n\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968 the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September, 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, [[Apollo 11]], the [[Moon landing|first human spaceflight landed on the Moon]]. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and the Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.\n\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 - The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 - The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 \u2013 [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 \u2013 First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 \u2013 Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n\n===Technology===\n\n====Automobiles====\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 \u2013 [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 \u2013 [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 \u2013 First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 \u2013 The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 \u2013 Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 \u2013 The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], '''[[Syncom 2]]''' is launched.\n* 1963 \u2013 First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 \u2013 The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 \u2013 [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 \u2013 The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 \u2013 [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 \u2013 The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 \u2013 [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 \u2013 The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], [[email]], and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Arpanet]], the research-oriented prototype of the [[Internet]], was introduced.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n* The [[Manson Murders]] occurred between 8\u201310 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] & [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During the anniversary celebrations, French president [[Charles De Gaulle]] visited Canada, and caused a considerable uproar by declaring his support for Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois independence.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco in 1967, and the [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[upstate New York]] in 1969. [[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The arrival of the [[Beatles]] in the US during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the US]]\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The 60's{{sic}} were a leap in human consciousness.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], and many other [[singer-songwriters]] to the public.\n\n[[Girl group]]s and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], the [[The Dixie Cups|Dixie Cups]], the [[Ronettes]], and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were [[African-American]], but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], the [[The Angels (American group)|Angels]], and the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las]] also emerged during  this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early '60s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 60s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]],\" \"[[409 (song)|409]],\" and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]],\" all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]],\" [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]],\" and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[traffic accident]]s. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]],\" [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]],\" [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve]],\" the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las']] \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" and [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers']] \"[[Last Kiss]].\"\n\nWhile rock 'n' roll had \"disappeared\" from the U.S. charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a 2-1/2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in prior decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n'''Significant events in music in the 1960s:'''\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8\u00bd]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jet\u00e9e]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of light-weight and affordable cameras, the underground [[New American Cinema|avant-garde film]] movement thrived. Canada's [[Michael Snow]], Americans [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]. Notable films in this genre are: ''[[Dog Star Man]]''; ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]''; ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]''; ''[[Chelsea Girls]]''; ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]''; ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]''; ''[[Flaming Creatures]]''.\n\nAside of [[Walt Disney]]'s most important blockbusters ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', Animated feature films which are of notable status include ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'', ''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'', ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.\n\n\n====Significant events in the film industry in the 1960s====\n\n*Removal of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[Production Code]] in 1967.\n*The decline and end of the [[Studio system|Studio System]].\n*The rise of \"[[art house]]\" films and theaters.\n*The end of the [[classical hollywood cinema]] era.\n*The beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] Era due to the counterculture.\n*The rise of independent producers that worked outside the Studio System.\n*Move to all-color production in Hollywood films.\n*The invention of the [[Nagra]] 1/4\", sync-sound, portable open-reel tape deck.\n*[[Expo 67]] where new film formats like [[Imax]] were invented and new ways of displaying film were tested.\n*Flat-bed film editing tables appear, like the [[Steenbeck]], they eventually replace the [[Moviola]] editing platform.\n*The [[French New Wave]].\n*[[Direct Cinema]] and [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentaries.\n*The beginning of the [[Golden Age of Porn]] in 1969, which continued throughout the 1970s and into the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1960s in television}}\nThe most prominent American TV series of the 1960s include: ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]], [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. ''The Flintstones'' was a favoured show, receiving 420 million views an episode with an average of 69 million views a day.  Some programming such as ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls; making fun of world leaders, and questioning U.S. involvement in and escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n[[Walt Disney]], the founder of the [[Walt Disney Co.]] died on 15 December 1966, from a major tumor in his left lung.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1960s in fashion}}\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\n* [[The Beatles]] exerted an enormous influence on young men's fashions and hairstyles in the 1960s which included most notably the [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], the [[Beatle boots]] and the [[Nehru jacket]].\n* The [[hippie]] movement late in the decade also had a strong influence on clothing styles, including [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom jeans]], [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] fabrics, as well as [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] prints.\n* The [[bikini]] came into fashion in 1963 after being featured in the film ''[[Beach Party]]''.\n* [[Mary Quant]] invented the [[miniskirt]], which became one of the most popular fashion rages in the late 1960s among young women and teenage girls. Its popularity continued throughout the first half of the 1970s and then disappeared temporarily from mainstream fashion before making a comeback in the mid-1980s.\n* Men's mainstream hairstyles ranged from the [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], the [[crew cut]], the [[flattop]] hairstyle, the tapered hairstyle, and short, parted hair in the early part of the decade, to longer parted hairstyles with [[sideburns]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* Women's mainstream hairstyles ranged from [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], the bird's nest hairstyle, and the [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] hairstyle in the early part of the decade, to very short styles popularized by [[Twiggy]] and [[Mia Farrow]] in [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* African-American hairstyles for men and women included the [[afro]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Mop-top hair.jpg|The [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], which became popular due to the Beatles but was considered at the time a rebellious hairstyle, was particularly fashionable among young men during the decade\nFile:On the Beach at Tiberias.jpg|The [[bikini]] became a fashionable item in the Western world during the decade\nFile:Londons_Carnaby_Street,_1966.jpg|\"Swinging London\" fashions on [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1966\nFile:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|[[Tie-dye]] shirt\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also|List of years in literature#1960s}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Olympics====\nThere were six [[Olympic Games]] held during the decade.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant.

From 18 January 1944 he led {{GS|U-852||2}} on a patrol heading for South African waters and then on to the [[Indian Ocean]]. While en route he encountered the lone Greek steamer {{SS|Peleus}}, and sank her with two torpedoes on 13 March.\n\n===''Peleus'' affair===\nThe sinking ''Peleus'' left a large debris field, amongst which were several survivors clinging to rafts and wreckage. This debris could betray the presence of ''U-852'' to enemy aircraft and shipping patrolling the area. Eck decided to sink the wreckage with [[hand grenades]] and [[automatic weapons]]. The question of whether this \"dispersal\" order explicitly or implicitly encouraged the killing of the sailors in the water, or whether this was an unfortunate example of [[collateral damage]] was the subject of a post-war trial. During the trial, Eck acknowledged he realized that by sinking the rafts, he was denying the seamen a chance of survival.\n\nEck ordered his junior officers to fire into the wreckage in an effort to sink it. Accounts differ greatly as to the number of shots fired and the damage done. The two surviving Greek sailors reported the shooting went on for a long time, and that at least four of their compatriots were killed by it. The German crew's report stated, however, that they had fired several short machine gun bursts into the wreckage and were unable to see their targets in the dark. The men shooting were later proven to be the ship's [[engineering officer]], [[Hans Lenz]] (who claimed he had done so under protest to spare an enlisted man from having to do it), [[Walter Weisspfennig]] (the ship's [[Physician|doctor]] who was not supposed to be handling [[firearm]]s), the second in command [[August Hoffmann]] and an enlisted engineer, [[Wolfgang Schwender]] (who was under direct orders and fired very few rounds). Eck was also present during the incident; the remaining crew were below decks.\n\nThe operation to sink the rafts and wreckage was not hugely successful, but the submarine was able to evade pursuit, and managed to sink the British cargo ship SS ''Dahomian'' off [[Cape Town]] on 1 April, this time hastily leaving the scene rather than pausing. A few weeks later on 30 April the boat was spotted by a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber flying from [[Aden]], which managed to damage her with [[depth charges]], thus preventing her from diving. Eck went to the [[Somalia|Somali]] coast and beached ''U-852'' on a coral reef while under attack from six bombers of [[No. 621 Squadron RAF|621 Squadron]] [[Royal Air Force]]. Of Eck's crew of 65, seven were killed and the remaining 58  made it to shore. They were captured by the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] and local militia and sent to prison camps to await the end of the war.\n\n===Post-war trial===\nIn prison, Lenz provided his captors with a signed confession. This, when combined with the testimony of the ''Peleus'' survivors and the log of ''U-852'' (which Eck had failed to destroy), provided conclusive testimony. Following the war's conclusion, all the above named crew members were placed on trial at the [[Hamburg war trials]] (an extension of the [[Nuremberg trials]] for minor war criminals) for the deaths of the steamer's crew. The judge was [[Melford Stevenson]]. After a four-day hearing, at which crew members, survivors and experts were called, all five men were found guilty.\n\nEck, Hoffmann, and Weisspfennig were sentenced to death. Weisspfennig was condemned because as a [[non-combatant]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], he was prohibited from firing weapons even in action. Eck and Hoffmann were executed because in their roles as the boat's senior officers, responsibility for the actions of their crew, as well as their own, fell directly on their shoulders. All three were shot by [[firing squad]] at [[L\u00fcneberg Heath]] on 30 November 1945.<ref>Associated Press, \"Six in U-Boat Crew Executed for Murders\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Saturday 1 December 1945, Volume 52, page 2.</ref> Lenz, by virtue of his protest at the time and his written confession, had his sentence commuted to [[life imprisonment]], while Schwender, the only man involved who had been under direct orders, was given seven years. Schwender was released in 1951; Lenz was released in 1952.\n\nThe incident was the only case in which U-boat personnel were convicted of [[war crime]]s committed during the Second World War,<ref>Clay Blair, ''Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted, 1942\u20131945'' (1998)</ref> compared to the thousands of people from the other branches of service. Similar and even worse [[war crime]]s had been committed by German submarines during the First World War, as in the case of the machine-gunning of the survivors of the {{Ship|HMHS|Llandovery Castle}} hospital ship. British and American submarines (such as {{HMS|Torbay|N79|6}} and {{USS|Wahoo|SS-238|6}}) were recorded as killing survivors of their targets,<ref>Blair 1998, p. 815</ref> and yet their crimes were hushed up at the time and for some years after the war; no legal proceedings were ever attempted against their crews.<ref>Clay Blair ''Silent Victory'' (2001 )</ref> The crew of the ''Wahoo'' could not be tried after the war, because they were by then dead, as were the crew of the German {{GS|U-247||2}}, who had shot the shipwrecked survivors of the fishing trawler ''Noreen Mary''.\n\nHowever, the historian Dwight R. Messimer from the [[United States Naval Institute|U.S. Naval Institute]] came to the conclusion, that \"regardless of whether or not Heinz Eck and the others were guilty of war crimes, poor judgment, or of just following orders, the outcome of the trial was [[Victor's justice|Siegerjustiz]] (victor's justice)\".<ref>Dwight R.

This, when combined with the testimony of the ''Peleus'' survivors and the log of ''U-852'' (which Eck had failed to destroy), provided conclusive testimony. Following the war's conclusion, all the above named crew members were placed on trial at the [[Hamburg war trials]] (an extension of the [[Nuremberg trials]] for minor war criminals) for the deaths of the steamer's crew. The judge was [[Melford Stevenson]]. After a four-day hearing, at which crew members, survivors and experts were called, all five men were found guilty.\n\nEck, Hoffmann, and Weisspfennig were sentenced to death. Weisspfennig was condemned because as a [[non-combatant]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], he was prohibited from firing weapons even in action. Eck and Hoffmann were executed because in their roles as the boat's senior officers, responsibility for the actions of their crew, as well as their own, fell directly on their shoulders. All three were shot by [[firing squad]] at [[L\u00fcneberg Heath]] on 30 November 1945.<ref>Associated Press, \"Six in U-Boat Crew Executed for Murders\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Saturday 1 December 1945, Volume 52, page 2.</ref> Lenz, by virtue of his protest at the time and his written confession, had his sentence commuted to [[life imprisonment]], while Schwender, the only man involved who had been under direct orders, was given seven years. Schwender was released in 1951; Lenz was released in 1952.\n\nThe incident was the only case in which U-boat personnel were convicted of [[war crime]]s committed during the Second World War,<ref>Clay Blair, ''Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted, 1942\u20131945'' (1998)</ref> compared to the thousands of people from the other branches of service. Similar and even worse [[war crime]]s had been committed by German submarines during the First World War, as in the case of the machine-gunning of the survivors of the {{Ship|HMHS|Llandovery Castle}} hospital ship. British and American submarines (such as {{HMS|Torbay|N79|6}} and {{USS|Wahoo|SS-238|6}}) were recorded as killing survivors of their targets,<ref>Blair 1998, p. 815</ref> and yet their crimes were hushed up at the time and for some years after the war; no legal proceedings were ever attempted against their crews.<ref>Clay Blair ''Silent Victory'' (2001 )</ref> The crew of the ''Wahoo'' could not be tried after the war, because they were by then dead, as were the crew of the German {{GS|U-247||2}}, who had shot the shipwrecked survivors of the fishing trawler ''Noreen Mary''.\n\nHowever, the historian Dwight R. Messimer from the [[United States Naval Institute|U.S. Naval Institute]] came to the conclusion, that \"regardless of whether or not Heinz Eck and the others were guilty of war crimes, poor judgment, or of just following orders, the outcome of the trial was [[Victor's justice|Siegerjustiz]] (victor's justice)\".<ref>Dwight R.

Typically, [[train]] cars have four doors on each side. In between the doors are rows of either cushioned or non-cushioned seats for 7 people, except for the outer ends of each wagon where there are smaller rows of seats for 3 people, marked for the use by the [[elderly]], [[disabled]] passengers, and pregnant women.\n\nThis list focuses primarily on trains that run on the 9 [[Rapid transit|urban subway lines]] in Seoul, the wide-area [[commuter rail]] lines integrated into the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]], and the [[AREX]] [[airport rail link|airport railroad]]. The list does not, however, include rolling stock used on the [[Incheon Subway]] and [[Seoul Light Rapid Transit|light metro]] systems such as the [[U Line]] or [[EverLine]].\n\n== Features ==\n=== Emergency procedures ===\n[[File:Doorwarning-seoulsubway.jpg|140px|right|How to open the doors in a Seoul Subway train.]]\nEach train has at least one [[fire extinguisher]] and options for opening the door in an emergency. A SOS phone is placed in most cars operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, and all new rolling stock.\n\n=== Help for English Speakers ===\n[[File:Lcd-display-seoulsubway.jpg|140px|right|LED display in a Seoul Subway train, showing Korean. Next the display would switch to an English version.]]\nAll trains in Seoul have both English and [[Korean language|Korean]] announcements regarding each train stop. In addition, a map displays their names in both [[Hangul|Korean]] and [[Latin alphabet|English characters]]. Many trains also have a [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display above a door or in the middle of the train car that displays information in Korean and English, though many side signs have been removed from trains due to their reduced visibility with the advent of platform screen doors. Some of the newest trains feature [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens above the doors or the middle of the train that display short commercials and station information.\n\n== Fleet ==\n=== Seoul Metro/(former) SMRT & Korail ===\nAll trains are 19.6 meters in length, 3.12 meters in width, and 3.8 meters in height. Newer trains operated by Seoul Metro are usually given the same number as the trains they are intended to replace.\n\nAll trains on Lines 5-8 are equipped with an [[Automatic train operation|ATO (Automatic Train Operation)]] systems. However, there is always a driver on board in case of a failure in the ATO system.\n\n==== Active (built until 2000) ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n! Series\n!

The list does not, however, include rolling stock used on the [[Incheon Subway]] and [[Seoul Light Rapid Transit|light metro]] systems such as the [[U Line]] or [[EverLine]].\n\n== Features ==\n=== Emergency procedures ===\n[[File:Doorwarning-seoulsubway.jpg|140px|right|How to open the doors in a Seoul Subway train.]]\nEach train has at least one [[fire extinguisher]] and options for opening the door in an emergency. A SOS phone is placed in most cars operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, and all new rolling stock.\n\n=== Help for English Speakers ===\n[[File:Lcd-display-seoulsubway.jpg|140px|right|LED display in a Seoul Subway train, showing Korean. Next the display would switch to an English version.]]\nAll trains in Seoul have both English and [[Korean language|Korean]] announcements regarding each train stop. In addition, a map displays their names in both [[Hangul|Korean]] and [[Latin alphabet|English characters]]. Many trains also have a [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display above a door or in the middle of the train car that displays information in Korean and English, though many side signs have been removed from trains due to their reduced visibility with the advent of platform screen doors. Some of the newest trains feature [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens above the doors or the middle of the train that display short commercials and station information.\n\n== Fleet ==\n=== Seoul Metro/(former) SMRT & Korail ===\nAll trains are 19.6 meters in length, 3.12 meters in width, and 3.8 meters in height. Newer trains operated by Seoul Metro are usually given the same number as the trains they are intended to replace.\n\nAll trains on Lines 5-8 are equipped with an [[Automatic train operation|ATO (Automatic Train Operation)]] systems. However, there is always a driver on board in case of a failure in the ATO system.\n\n==== Active (built until 2000) ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n! Series\n!

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black. In the South, white schools had only white pupils and teachers, while black schools had only black teachers and black students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools|title=Jim Crow's Schools|date=2014-08-08|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome [[streetcar]] companies did not segregate voluntarily.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\".

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks.

However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The prejudice that many young African-Americans experience causes them undue stress which has been proven to undermine [[cognitive development]]. [[Eric Hanushek]] and his co-authors have considered racial concentrations in schools, and they find large and important effects. Black students appear to be systematically and physically hurt by larger concentrations of black students in their school. These effects extend neither to white nor to Hispanic students in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, John F.

In Washington, D.C., 94 percent of children were black or Hispanic; less than 5 percent were white.\n\n[[Jonathan Kozol]] expanded on this topic in his book ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America.''\n\nThe \"New American apartheid\" refers to the allegation that US drug and criminal policies in practice target blacks on the basis of race. The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> A 2010 US Census showed that 27.4% of all African-Americans lived under the poverty line, the highest percentage of any other ethnic group in the United States.<ref>Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010\". U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states in response to the dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education.<ref>Feistritzer, Emily (February 1, 2006). \"Alternative Teacher Certification\". National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. I know my daughter's performance is hers, but I wonder where she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act. Many students at BHS owe their graduation and success to the assistance under this law.\"<ref name=\"sfbayview1\">{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Stagman |title=Racism and classism in Berkeley streets and schools |publisher=San Francisco Bay View National Black Newspaper |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url=http://sfbayview.com/2012/racism-and-classism-in-berkeley-streets-and-schools/}}</ref>\n\nLeo then goes on to note that, \"the majority of the students receiving assistance under the act are Black and Brown.\"<ref name=\"sfbayview1\"/> There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview of the success of the school's ability to educate their students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\">{{cite web |title=ELEMENTARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION: A Blueprint for Reform: The Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act |publisher= US Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/publication_pg7.html#part7|date= 2011-05-27 }}</ref> Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial [[achievement gap in the United States]] by instituting common expectations for all students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, \"There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.\"<ref>\"Acting White\". By Roland G. Fryer, Jr. Education Next. Winter 2006 (vol. 6, no. 1).</ref> Therefore, not only are there economic and prehistoric causes of racial educational segregation, but there are also social notions that continue to be obstacles to be overcome before minority groups can achieve success in education.\n\nMississippi is one of the US states where some public schools still remain highly segregated just like the 1960s when discrimination against black people was very rampant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/history-of-segregation-still-evident-in-mississippi-region-1.3181796|title=History of segregation still evident in Mississippi region|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In many communities where black kids represent the majority, white children are the only ones who enroll in small private schools.

The state was more segregated for black students compared to any other Southern state. There is a case of double segregation because students have become isolated both by race and household income. In New York City, 19 out of 32 school districts have fewer white students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/new-york-schools-segregated_n_5034455.html|title=The Nation's Most Segregated Schools Aren't Where You'd Think They'd Be|last=Resmovits|first=Joy|date=2014-03-26|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court tried to deal with school segregation more than six decades ago but impoverished and colored students still do not have equal access to opportunities in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment|title=History \u2013 Brown v.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nOne study finds that an area's residential racial segregation increases metropolitan rates of black poverty and overall black-white [[income inequality in the United States|income disparities]], while decreasing rates of white poverty and [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] within the white population.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Wrong Side(s) of the Tracks: The Causal Effects of Racial Segregation on Urban Poverty and Inequality|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1945-7782|pages = 34\u201366|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.3.2.34|first = Elizabeth Oltmans|last = Ananat|citeseerx = 10.1.1.637.8290}}</ref>\n\n===Single parenthood===\nOne study finds that African-Americans who live in segregated metro areas have a higher likelihood of single-parenthood than Blacks who live in more integrated places.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/3/827|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 827\u2013872|volume = 112|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|first = David M.|last = Cutler|first2 = Edward L.|last2 = Glaeser}}</ref>\n\n===Public spending===\nResearch shows that segregation along racial lines contributes to public goods inequalities.

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black. In the South, white schools had only white pupils and teachers, while black schools had only black teachers and black students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools|title=Jim Crow's Schools|date=2014-08-08|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome [[streetcar]] companies did not segregate voluntarily.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\".

In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other. These state laws always targeted marriage between whites and blacks, and in some states also prohibited marriages between whites and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or Asians. As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

In analyzing racial and class segregation, the book documents the migration of white Americans from urban centers to small-town, exurban, and rural communities. Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate. Yet the outcomes of those policies and beliefs have negative, racial impacts, namely with segregation.<ref>Benjamin, Rich.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev. Martin Luther King]], who organized the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] (1955\u20131956). A federal court suit in Alabama, ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' (1956), was successful at the district court level, which ruled Alabama's bus segregation laws illegal. It was upheld at the Supreme Court level.\n\nIn 1961 [[Congress of Racial Equality]] director [[James Farmer]], other CORE members and some [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] members traveled as a mixed race group, [[Freedom Riders]], on Greyhound buses from Washington, D.C., headed towards [[New Orleans]]. In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The prejudice that many young African-Americans experience causes them undue stress which has been proven to undermine [[cognitive development]].

Black students appear to be systematically and physically hurt by larger concentrations of black students in their school. These effects extend neither to white nor to Hispanic students in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality.<ref>Eric A. Hanushek, John F.

In Washington, D.C., 94 percent of children were black or Hispanic; less than 5 percent were white.\n\n[[Jonathan Kozol]] expanded on this topic in his book ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America.''\n\nThe \"New American apartheid\" refers to the allegation that US drug and criminal policies in practice target blacks on the basis of race. The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> A 2010 US Census showed that 27.4% of all African-Americans lived under the poverty line, the highest percentage of any other ethnic group in the United States.<ref>Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010\". U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states in response to the dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education.<ref>Feistritzer, Emily (February 1, 2006). \"Alternative Teacher Certification\". National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. I know my daughter's performance is hers, but I wonder where she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act.

One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview of the success of the school's ability to educate their students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\">{{cite web |title=ELEMENTARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION: A Blueprint for Reform: The Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act |publisher= US Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/publication_pg7.html#part7|date= 2011-05-27 }}</ref> Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial [[achievement gap in the United States]] by instituting common expectations for all students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, \"There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.\"<ref>\"Acting White\".

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans.
