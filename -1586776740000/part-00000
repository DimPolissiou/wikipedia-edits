He was one of the first people to take photographs in East Asia and one of the first [[war photography|war photographers]]. He is noted for his [[genre works]], portraits, and views and [[panoramic photography|panoramas]] of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and the [[Second Opium War]], and represents the first substantial body of [[photojournalism]]. He influenced other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.\n\n==Early life and identity==\nA death certificate discovered in 2009 shows that Beato was born in [[Venice]] in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in [[Florence]]. The death certificate also indicates that he was a [[British subject]] and a bachelor.<ref name=\"BennettHistory\">Bennett, ''History of Photography in China, 1842\u20131860,'' p. 241.</ref>{{refn|Recent scholarship had uncovered an application by Beato for a travel permit in 1858 that included information suggesting he was born in 1833 or 1834 on the island of Corfu.<ref name=\"Dobson\">Dobson, \"'I been to keep up my position'\", p. 31.</ref> <!--Earlier sources had given his birth date as 1825 or ca. 1825, but these dates may have been confused references to the possible birth date of his brother, [[Antonio Beato|Antonio]].

The movements of his family and of early nineteenth century history in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] mean that he can justifiably be described by all these terms. Corfu was on and off part of Venetian territory from 1386 until 1815, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] placed it and the other Ionian Islands under British protection. Corfu was ceded to Greece in 1864.

Beato\", it was long assumed that there was one photographer who somehow photographed at the same time in places as distant as Egypt and Japan. In 1983 it was shown by Chantal Edel<ref>Zannier, ''Antonio e Felice Beato,'' n.p.</ref> that \"[[Felice A. Beato|Felice Antonio Beato]]\" represented two brothers, Felice Beato and Antonio Beato, who sometimes worked together, sharing a signature. The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image.\n\n==Mediterranean, the Crimea and India==\nLittle is certain about Felice Beato's early development as a photographer, though it is said that he bought his first and only lens in Paris in 1851.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 90.</ref> He probably met the British photographer [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]] in Malta in 1850 and accompanied him to [[Constantinople]] in 1851. James Robertson (1813\u201388), became his brother-in-law in 1855. Superintendent of the Imperial Mint, Robertson opened one of the first commercial photography studios in the capital between 1854 and 1856. Robertson had been an engraver at the Imperial Ottoman Mint since 1843 and had probably taken up photography in the 1840s.<ref>Broecker, p. 58; Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 89, 90.</ref> In 1853 the two began photographing together and they formed a partnership called \"Robertson & Beato\" either in that year or in 1854, when Robertson opened a photographic studio in [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], Constantinople. Robertson and Beato were joined by Beato's brother Antonio on photographic expeditions to [[Malta]] in 1854 or 1856 and to Greece and [[Jerusalem]] in 1857. A number of the firm's photographs produced in the 1850s are signed \"Robertson, Beato and Co.\", and it is believed that the \"and Co.\" refers to Antonio.<ref>Pare, ''Photography and Architecture,'' p. 245 (citing Vaczek and Buckland, p. 190); Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Image-Secundra Bagh after Indian Mutiny higher res.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of the ruins of a palace with human skeletal remains in the foreground|The ruins of Sikandar Bagh palace showing the skeletal remains of rebels in the foreground, Lucknow, India, 1858]]\n\nIn late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato.

Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant,<ref>Hannavy, J., ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography,'' Routledge, 2013, p. 128</ref> however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death.<ref>Greenough, p. 21; Pare, \"Roger Fenton\", p. 226.</ref> They photographed the fall of [[Sevastopol]] in September 1855, producing about 60 images.<ref>Broecker, p. 58.</ref> Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.<ref>Gartlan, L., \"James Robertson and Felice Beato in the Crimea: Recent findings,\" ''History of Photography,'' Vol. 29, No. 1, 2005, pp72-80</ref>\n\nIn February 1858 Beato arrived in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and began travelling throughout [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Northern India]] to document the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].<ref>Harris, p. 23; Dehejia, p. 121; Masselos and Gupta, p. 1.</ref>{{refn|Gernsheim states that Beato and Robertson ''both'' travelled to India in 1857, but it is now generally accepted that Beato travelled there alone.<ref>Gernsheim, p. 96.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses.<ref name=\"Zannier, Beato, 447\">Zannier, \"Beato\", p. 447.</ref> It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of [[Sikandar Bagh]] in [[Lucknow]] he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact<ref>Gartlan, \"Felice Beato\", p. 128.</ref> (see [[#Taku Forts|events at Taku Forts]]).

Beato was sent from India to photograph the Anglo-French military expedition to China in the [[Second Opium War]]. He arrived in [[Hong Kong]] in March<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 92.</ref> and immediately began photographing the city and its surroundings as far as [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref name=\"cfo92-93\">Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 92\u201393.</ref> Beato's photographs are some of the earliest taken in China.<ref>Rosenblum, p. 124.</ref>\n\nWhile in Hong Kong, Beato met [[Charles Wirgman]], an artist and correspondent for the ''[[Illustrated London News]].'' The two accompanied the Anglo-French forces travelling north to [[Dalian Bay|Talien Bay]], then to [[Beitang, Tanggu District|Pehtang]] and the [[Taku Forts]] at the mouth of the [[Hai He|Peiho]], and on to [[Beijing|Peking]] and [[Summer Palace|Qingyi Yuan]], the suburban Summer Palace.<ref name=\"cfo92-93\" /> For places on this route and later in Japan, Wirgman's (and others') illustrations for the ''Illustrated London News'' were often derived from Beato's photographs.{{refn|For an anthology of the illustrations (as well as the texts, although in Japanese translation only) of the ''Illustrated London News''{{'}} Japanese material, see Kanai.|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===Taku Forts===\n[[File:Felice Beato (British, born Italy) - (Interior of the Angle of Taku North Fort Immediately After Its Capture by Storm) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=The interior of an earthen and wooden fort with dead bodies scattered around it|Interior of Fort Taku immediately after capture 21 August 1860]]\n\nBeato's photographs of the Second Opium War are the first to document a military campaign as it unfolded,<ref name=\"lacoste10\">Lacoste, p. 10.</ref> doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His photographs of the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers.<ref name=\"lacoste10\" /> The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first\u2014before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.<ref>Harris.</ref>\n\nBeato's images of the Chinese dead and his manner of producing them particularly reveal the ideological aspects of his photojournalism. Dr. David F. Rennie, a member of the expedition, noted in his campaign memoir, \"I walked round the ramparts on the west side. They were thickly strewn with dead\u2014in the north-west angle thirteen were lying in one group around a gun.

Wenchang Tower (\u6587\u660c\u9601) of the [[Summer Palace]] (Yihe Yuan), before being burnt down, October 1860]]\n\nJust outside Peking, Beato took photographs at Qingyi Yuan (now Yihe Yuan, the Summer Palace), a private estate of the Emperor of China comprising palace pavilions, temples, a large artificial lake, and gardens. Some of these photographs, taken between 6 and 18 October 1860, are unique images of buildings that were plundered and looted by the Anglo-French forces beginning on 6 October. On 18 and 19 October the buildings were torched by the British First Division on the orders of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] as a reprisal against the emperor for the torture and deaths of twenty members of an Allied diplomatic party.

Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's photographs, while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other works. (Beato's photographs were also used for engravings within Aim\u00e9 Humbert's ''Le Japon illustr\u00e9''<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 96, 98, 100; Hockley, pp. 77\u201380.</ref> and other works.)

Accompanying ambassadorial delegations<ref name=\"Gartlan, Felix Beato, 129\">Gartlan, \"Felix Beato\", p. 129.</ref> and taking any other opportunities created by his personal popularity and close relationship with the British military, Beato reached areas of Japan where few westerners had ventured, and in addition to conventionally pleasing subjects sought sensational and macabre subject matter such as heads on display after decapitation.<ref>Handy, p. 57.</ref> His images are remarkable not only for their quality, but also for their rarity as photographic views of [[Edo period]] Japan.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 97\">Bennett, ''Photography in Japan, 1853\u20131912'', p. 97.</ref>\n\nThe greater part of Beato's work in Japan contrasted strongly with his earlier work in India and China, which \"had underlined and even celebrated conflict and the triumph of British imperial might\".<ref>Dobson, \"'I been to keep up my position'\", p. 32.</ref> Aside from the ''Portrait of Prince Kung'', any appearances of Chinese people in Beato's earlier work had been peripheral (minor, blurred, or both) or as corpses. With the exception of his work in September 1864 as an official photographer on the British military expedition to [[Bombardment of Shimonoseki|Shimonoseki]],<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 94\"/> Beato was eager to portray Japanese people, and did so uncondescendingly, even showing them as defiant in the face of the [[Extraterritoriality|elevated status]] of westerners.<ref>Dobson, \"'I been to keep up my position'\", ''passim.''</ref>\n\nBeato was very active while in Japan. In 1865 he produced a number of dated views of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and its surroundings.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 94\"/> From 1866 he was often caricatured in ''Japan Punch,'' which was founded and edited by Wirgman.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 95\">Bennett, ''Photography in Japan, 1853\u20131912'', p. 95.</ref> In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama, Beato lost his studio and many, perhaps all, of his negatives.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 94\"/>\n\nWhile Beato was the first photographer in Japan to sell albums of his works, he quickly recognised their full commercial potential.<ref>Hockley, p. 67.</ref> By around 1870 their sale had become the mainstay of his business.<ref>Hockley, p. 68.</ref> Although the customer would select the content of earlier albums, Beato moved towards albums of his own selection.

He also appeared in court on several occasions, variously as plaintiff, defendant, and witness.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 104\u2013109, ''passim.''</ref> On 6 August 1873 Beato was appointed [[Consulate general|Consul General]] for Greece in Japan.<ref name=\"cfo103\" />\n\nIn 1877 Beato sold most of his stock to the firm [[Stillfried & Andersen]],<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 97\"/> who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to [[Adolfo Farsari]] in 1885.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 107.</ref> Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato apparently retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 107\u2013108.</ref> On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in [[Port Said]], Egypt.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref> It was reported in a Japanese newspaper that he had lost all his money on the Yokohama silver exchange.<ref name=\"cfo112\">Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Burma and later years==\n[[File:Hman Kyaung Mandalay.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen's Silver Pagoda, Mandalay, c. 1889]]\n\nFrom 1884 to 1885 Beato was the official photographer of the expeditionary forces led by Baron (later Viscount) [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|G.J. Wolseley]] to [[Khartoum]], Sudan, in relief of [[Charles George Gordon|General Charles Gordon]].<ref name=\"cfo112\" />\n\nBriefly back in England in 1886, Beato lectured the London and Provincial Photographic Society on photographic techniques.<ref name=\"cfo112\" />\n\nHe arrived in Burma probably in December 1886, after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885. Much publicity had been made in the British press about the three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]], which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 with the fall of [[Mandalay]] and the capture of King [[Thibaw Min]].\n\nBeato, who had covered military operations in India and China, was probably attracted by the news of the annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get to see more of the action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the [[Mandalay Palace|Royal Palace]], Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.\n\nBeato set up a photographic studio in Mandalay and, in 1894, a curiosa and antiques dealership, running both businesses separately and, according to records at the time, very successfully.\n\nHis past experience and the credibility derived from his time in Japan brought him a large clientele of opulent locals, posing in traditional attire for official portraits. Other images, from Buddhas to landscapes and buildings, were sold from master albums in Burma and Europe.\n\nIn 1896, Trench Gascoigne published some of Beato's images in ''Among Pagodas and Fair Ladies'' and, the following year, [[Alice Hart|Mrs Ernest Hart's]] ''Picturesque Burma'' included more, while George W. Bird in his ''Wanderings in Burma'' not only presented thirty-five credited photographs, but published a long description of Beato's businesses and recommended visitors to come by his shop.\n\nBy that time, Beato's photographs had come to represent the very image of Burma to the rest of the world, which it would remain for decades to come.\n\nAs his curios business developed, with branches in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], Mandalay but also in Colombo and London, he also acquired the Photographic Art Gallery in Mandalay in 1903, another photographic studio. In his old age, Beato had become an important business party in Colonial Burma, involved in many enterprises from electric works to life insurance and mining.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nAlthough Beato was previously believed to have died in Rangoon or Mandalay in 1905 or 1906,<ref>Robinson, p. 41; Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 116; Zannier, \"Beato\", p. 446.</ref> his death certificate, discovered in 2009, indicates that he died on 29 January 1909 in [[Florence]], Italy.\n\nWhether acknowledged as his own work, sold as Stillfried & Andersen's, or encountered as anonymous engravings, Beato's work had a major impact:\n\n<blockquote>For over fifty years into the early twentieth century, Beato's photographs of Asia constituted the standard imagery of travel diaries, illustrated newspapers, and other published accounts, and thus helped shape \"Western\" notions of several Asian societies.<ref>Gartlan, \"Felix Beato\", p. 131.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Photographic techniques==\nPhotographs of the 19th century often now show the limitations of the technology used, yet Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced [[albumen print|albumen silver prints]] from [[collodion process|wet collodion]] glass-plate [[negative (photography)|negatives]].<ref>Lacoste, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nBeato pioneered and refined the techniques of [[Hand-colouring of photographs|hand-colouring photographs]]<ref name=\"Gartlan, Felix Beato, 129\"/> and making panoramas.<ref>Gartlan, \"Felix Beato\", p. 130.</ref> He may have started hand-colouring photographs at the suggestion of Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew.<ref>Bennett, ''Early Japanese Images,'' p. 39.</ref> Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent.{{refn|Bennett quotes and summarises collector Henry Rosin's appraisal of Beato's hand-coloured photographs.<ref>Bennett, ''Early Japanese Images,'' p. 43; Robinson, p. 48.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view.<ref name=\"Lacoste 8-9\">Lacoste, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The complete version of his panorama of [[Beitang District|Pehtang]] comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"Lacoste 8-9\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Panorama of Edo.jpg|800px|''Panorama of Yedo from Atagoyama'': a panorama (comprising five albumen prints) of Edo (now Tokyo), showing ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' residences, 1865 or 1866}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[John McCosh]]\n* ''[[Felice...Felice...]]'', a 1998 Dutch drama loosely based on Beato's time in Japan\n* [[History of photography]]\n* [[Sakoku]]\n* [[List of Westerners who visited Japan before 1868]]\n* [[Felice A.

He was one of the first people to take photographs in East Asia and one of the first [[war photography|war photographers]]. He is noted for his [[genre works]], portraits, and views and [[panoramic photography|panoramas]] of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and the [[Second Opium War]], and represents the first substantial body of [[photojournalism]]. He influenced other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.\n\n==Early life and identity==\nA death certificate discovered in 2009 shows that Beato was born in [[Venice]] in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in [[Florence]]. The death certificate also indicates that he was a [[British subject]] and a bachelor.<ref name=\"BennettHistory\">Bennett, ''History of Photography in China, 1842\u20131860,'' p. 241.</ref>{{refn|Recent scholarship had uncovered an application by Beato for a travel permit in 1858 that included information suggesting he was born in 1833 or 1834 on the island of Corfu.<ref name=\"Dobson\">Dobson, \"'I been to keep up my position'\", p. 31.</ref> <!--Earlier sources had given his birth date as 1825 or ca. 1825, but these dates may have been confused references to the possible birth date of his brother, [[Antonio Beato|Antonio]].

In 1983 it was shown by Chantal Edel<ref>Zannier, ''Antonio e Felice Beato,'' n.p.</ref> that \"[[Felice A. Beato|Felice Antonio Beato]]\" represented two brothers, Felice Beato and Antonio Beato, who sometimes worked together, sharing a signature. The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image.\n\n==Mediterranean, the Crimea and India==\nLittle is certain about Felice Beato's early development as a photographer, though it is said that he bought his first and only lens in Paris in 1851.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 90.</ref> He probably met the British photographer [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]] in Malta in 1850 and accompanied him to [[Constantinople]] in 1851.

Superintendent of the Imperial Mint, Robertson opened one of the first commercial photography studios in the capital between 1854 and 1856.

Some of these photographs, taken between 6 and 18 October 1860, are unique images of buildings that were plundered and looted by the Anglo-French forces beginning on 6 October. On 18 and 19 October the buildings were torched by the British First Division on the orders of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] as a reprisal against the emperor for the torture and deaths of twenty members of an Allied diplomatic party.

Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's photographs, while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other works. (Beato's photographs were also used for engravings within Aim\u00e9 Humbert's ''Le Japon illustr\u00e9''<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 96, 98, 100; Hockley, pp. 77\u201380.</ref> and other works.)

Accompanying ambassadorial delegations<ref name=\"Gartlan, Felix Beato, 129\">Gartlan, \"Felix Beato\", p. 129.</ref> and taking any other opportunities created by his personal popularity and close relationship with the British military, Beato reached areas of Japan where few westerners had ventured, and in addition to conventionally pleasing subjects sought sensational and macabre subject matter such as heads on display after decapitation.<ref>Handy, p. 57.</ref> His images are remarkable not only for their quality, but also for their rarity as photographic views of [[Edo period]] Japan.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 97\">Bennett, ''Photography in Japan, 1853\u20131912'', p. 97.</ref>\n\nThe greater part of Beato's work in Japan contrasted strongly with his earlier work in India and China, which \"had underlined and even celebrated conflict and the triumph of British imperial might\".<ref>Dobson, \"'I been to keep up my position'\", p. 32.</ref> Aside from the ''Portrait of Prince Kung'', any appearances of Chinese people in Beato's earlier work had been peripheral (minor, blurred, or both) or as corpses. With the exception of his work in September 1864 as an official photographer on the British military expedition to [[Bombardment of Shimonoseki|Shimonoseki]],<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 94\"/> Beato was eager to portray Japanese people, and did so uncondescendingly, even showing them as defiant in the face of the [[Extraterritoriality|elevated status]] of westerners.<ref>Dobson, \"'I been to keep up my position'\", ''passim.''</ref>\n\nBeato was very active while in Japan. In 1865 he produced a number of dated views of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and its surroundings.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 94\"/> From 1866 he was often caricatured in ''Japan Punch,'' which was founded and edited by Wirgman.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 95\">Bennett, ''Photography in Japan, 1853\u20131912'', p. 95.</ref> In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama, Beato lost his studio and many, perhaps all, of his negatives.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 94\"/>\n\nWhile Beato was the first photographer in Japan to sell albums of his works, he quickly recognised their full commercial potential.<ref>Hockley, p. 67.</ref> By around 1870 their sale had become the mainstay of his business.<ref>Hockley, p. 68.</ref> Although the customer would select the content of earlier albums, Beato moved towards albums of his own selection. It was probably Beato who introduced to photography in Japan the double concept of views and costumes/manners, an approach common in photography of the Mediterranean.<ref>Hockley, p. 72.</ref> By 1868 Beato had readied two volumes of photographs, \"Native Types\", containing 100 portraits and genre works, and \"Views of Japan\", containing 98 landscapes and cityscapes.<ref>{{cite book|title=F.\u30d9\u30a2\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u96c61\uff08Photo Album, in Japanese but with some English subtitles, from the Yokohama Archives of History\uff09|date=July 6, 2006|isbn=978-4-7503-2369-5}}</ref>\n\nMany of the photographs in Beato's albums were [[hand-colouring|hand-coloured]], a technique that in his studio successfully applied the refined skills of [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolourists]] and [[woodblock printing|woodblock printmakers]] to European photography.<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 97\"/>\n\nSince about the time of the ending of his partnership with Wirgman in 1869, Beato attempted to retire from the work of a photographer, instead attempting other ventures<ref name=\"bennettpj86\">Bennett, ''Photography in Japan,'' p. 86.</ref><ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 97\"/> and delegating photographic work to others within his own studio in Yokohama, \"F.

He owned land<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 99, 100, 108.</ref> and several studios, was a property consultant, had a financial interest in the Grand Hotel of Yokohama,<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 95\"/> and was a dealer in imported carpets and women's bags, among other things. He also appeared in court on several occasions, variously as plaintiff, defendant, and witness.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 104\u2013109, ''passim.''</ref> On 6 August 1873 Beato was appointed [[Consulate general|Consul General]] for Greece in Japan.<ref name=\"cfo103\" />\n\nIn 1877 Beato sold most of his stock to the firm [[Stillfried & Andersen]],<ref name=\"Bennett 2006, 97\"/> who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to [[Adolfo Farsari]] in 1885.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 107.</ref> Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato apparently retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 107\u2013108.</ref> On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in [[Port Said]], Egypt.<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref> It was reported in a Japanese newspaper that he had lost all his money on the Yokohama silver exchange.<ref name=\"cfo112\">Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Burma and later years==\n[[File:Hman Kyaung Mandalay.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen's Silver Pagoda, Mandalay, c. 1889]]\n\nFrom 1884 to 1885 Beato was the official photographer of the expeditionary forces led by Baron (later Viscount) [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|G.J. Wolseley]] to [[Khartoum]], Sudan, in relief of [[Charles George Gordon|General Charles Gordon]].<ref name=\"cfo112\" />\n\nBriefly back in England in 1886, Beato lectured the London and Provincial Photographic Society on photographic techniques.<ref name=\"cfo112\" />\n\nHe arrived in Burma probably in December 1886, after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885. Much publicity had been made in the British press about the three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]], which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 with the fall of Mandalay and the capture of King [[Thibaw Min]].\n\nBeato, who had covered military operations in India and China, was probably attracted by the news of the annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get to see more of the action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.\n\nBeato set up a photographic studio in Mandalay and, in 1894, a curiosa and antiques dealership, running both businesses separately and, according to records at the time, very successfully.\n\nHis past experience and the credibility derived from his time in Japan brought him a large clientele of opulent locals, posing in traditional attire for official portraits. Other images, from Buddhas to landscapes and buildings, were sold from master albums in Burma and Europe.\n\nIn 1896, Trench Gascoigne published some of Beato's images in ''Among Pagodas and Fair Ladies'' and, the following year, [[Alice Hart|Mrs Ernest Hart's]] ''Picturesque Burma'' included more, while George W. Bird in his ''Wanderings in Burma'' not only presented thirty-five credited photographs but published a long description of Beato's businesses and recommended visitors to come by his shop.\n\nBy that time, Beato's photographs had come to represent the very image of Burma to the rest of the world, which it would remain for decades to come.\n\nAs his curios business developed, with branches in Rangoon, Mandalay but also in Colombo and London, he also acquired the Photographic Art Gallery in Mandalay in 1903, another photographic studio. In his old age, Beato had become an important business party in Colonial Burma, involved in many enterprises from electric works to life insurance and mining.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nAlthough Beato was previously believed to have died in Rangoon or Mandalay in 1905 or 1906,<ref>Robinson, p. 41; Clark, Fraser, and Osman, p. 116; Zannier, \"Beato\", p. 446.</ref> his death certificate, discovered in 2009, indicates that he died on 29 January 1909 in [[Florence]], Italy.\n\nWhether acknowledged as his own work, sold as Stillfried & Andersen's, or encountered as anonymous engravings, Beato's work had a major impact:\n\n<blockquote>For over fifty years into the early twentieth century, Beato's photographs of Asia constituted the standard imagery of travel diaries, illustrated newspapers, and other published accounts, and thus helped shape \"Western\" notions of several Asian societies.<ref>Gartlan, \"Felix Beato\", p. 131.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Photographic techniques==\nPhotographs of the 19th century often now show the limitations of the technology used, yet Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced [[albumen print|albumen silver prints]] from [[collodion process|wet collodion]] glass-plate [[negative (photography)|negatives]].<ref>Lacoste, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nBeato pioneered and refined the techniques of hand-colouring photographs<ref name=\"Gartlan, Felix Beato, 129\"/> and making panoramas.<ref>Gartlan, \"Felix Beato\", p. 130.</ref> He may have started hand-colouring photographs at the suggestion of Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew.<ref>Bennett, ''Early Japanese Images,'' p. 39.</ref> Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent.{{refn|Bennett quotes and summarises collector Henry Rosin's appraisal of Beato's hand-coloured photographs.<ref>Bennett, ''Early Japanese Images,'' p. 43; Robinson, p. 48.</ref>|group=\"note\"}} As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness.

In addition to this, the episodes were created by former show scriptwriters, in an attempt to \"tempt back some of ''Casualty''{{'s}} writing alumni who had gone onto bigger and better things\".<ref name=\"Erika1\"/> The first standalone episode was supposed to be broadcast on 1 November 2014,<ref name=\"Erika1\"/> however the episode was later moved to 15 November 2014, for unknown reasons. The episode, entitled \"Deadfall\", was written by [[Jeff Povey]] and directed by David Innes Edwards, and featured main character Lily Chao (Yu) solving a murder mystery.<ref name=\"ep10\"/> The second episode was broadcast on 28 March 2015, entitled \"The Road Not Taken\".

The episode featured main character Ethan Hardy (Rainsford) solving a mysterious murder case.<ref name=\"ep39\"/> \n\nIn August 2014, Hossington revealed in an interview with [[Digital Spy]] that her main aims for ''Casualty'' since taking over were to focus the show on \"the characters who the audience really loved\" and to see more \"interest and compelling\" guest stories. As well as moving the show's focus back to character-based storylines and reintroducing compelling guest stories, Hossington also revealed that there were \"certain aspects\" of the show which she felt were \"out of date in terms of what the show looked like\". Hossington told Digital Spy that she looked at everything: from the cameras the show were shooting on, to the format the show was shooting in, as well as changing the light bulbs in the studio.<ref name=\"Erika1\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe show was awarded the Best Soap and Continuing Drama accolade at the 2015 [[Royal Television Society]] award ceremony, beating competitors ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[EastEnders]]''.

{"title_page": "Eco hotel", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\nAn '''eco hotel''', or a '''green hotel''', is an environmentally sustainable [[hotel]] or accommodation that has made important environmental improvements to its structure in order to minimize its impact on the [[natural environment]]. The basic definition of an eco-friendly hotel is an [[environmentally responsible]] lodging that follows the practices of [[Sustainable living|green living]]. These hotels have to be certified green by an independent third-party or by the state they are located in. Traditionally, these hotels were mostly presented as Eco Lodges because of their location, often in [[jungle]]s, and their design inspired by the use of traditional building methods applied by skilled local craftsmen in areas, such as [[Costa Rica]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThese improvements can include non-toxic housekeeping practices, the use of renewable energy, organic soaps, energy-efficient light fixtures, and recycling programs. It is beneficial for these hotels to get certain certifications in order to be environmentally compliant. One beneficial certification specifically for hotels is the [[LEED certification]]. A LEED-certified hotel provides benefits to the environment through energy efficient practices. An eco hotel should follow a set of best practices in order to do their part to benefit the environment. Some of these best practices include serving local [[Organic food|organic]] food in restaurants, reusing linens when a guest is staying for more than one night, and incorporating in-room [[recycling]] and [[Compost|composting]] programs. Hotels that have these certifications and best practices<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Enz|first=Cathy|date=1999|title=Best Hotel Environmental Practices|url=https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1453&context=articles|journal=Best Hotel Environmental Practices|volume=|pages=1\u20138|via=}}</ref> can attract environmentally conscious travelers and stand out from other hotels.\n\n==Criteria==\nAn eco hotel must usually meet the following criteria:\n* Dependence on the natural environment\n* Ecological sustainability\n* Proven contribution to conservation\n* Provision of environmental training programs\n* Incorporation of cultural considerations\n* Provision of an economic return to the local community\n\n==Characteristics==\nGreen hotels follow strict green guidelines to ensure that their guests are staying in a safe, non-toxic and energy-efficient accommodation. Here are some basic characteristics of a green hotel:\n\n*Housekeeping uses non-toxic cleaning agents and laundry detergent \n*100% [[organic cotton]] sheets, towels and mattresses \n*Non-smoking environment \n*Renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy \n*Bulk organic soap and amenities instead of individual packages to reduce waste \n*Guest room and hotel lobby recycling bins \n*Towel and sheet re-use (guests can tell housekeeping to leave these slightly used items to reduce water consumption) \n*Energy-efficient lighting \n*On-site transportation with green vehicles \n*Serve organic and local-grown food\n*Non-disposable dishes\n*Offers a fresh-air exchange system\n*[[Greywater]] recycling, which is the reuse of kitchen, bath and laundry water for garden and landscaping \n*Newspaper recycling program\n\n==Definition==\nEcology is a very strong trend, either convictions or a fashion, caring for the earth has become an ideal of many. As a result, eco-hotels have become an increasingly popular alternative in the tourism industry, the increase in demand has led therefore to a large range of hotels with planet friendly options for all requirements.\n\nAccording to the Royal Spanish Academy, one of the interpretations of the term ecology includes \"defense and protection of nature and environment\" From what we understand, to be green what is sought is to defend and protect everything natural. around us. contact with nature is something almost inherent to the holiday, providing an opportunity to carry out environmental.\n\nAn ecological hotel is one that is fully integrated into the environment without damaging the environment, contributing in some way to progress and improvement of the local community and sustainable growth of the tourism industry.\n\nThe term has been used on a more regular basis as new websites devoted to the subject become more prominent and hotel owners become more interested in protecting the areas their guests have come to visit.\n\nNew properties are being built from sustainable resources\u2013tropical [[hardwood]]s, local stone\u2013and designed to better blend in with their environment.

The basic definition of an eco-friendly hotel is an [[environmentally responsible]] lodging that follows the practices of [[Sustainable living|green living]]. These hotels have to be certified green by an independent third-party or by the state they are located in. Traditionally, these hotels were mostly presented as Eco Lodges because of their location, often in [[jungle]]s, and their design inspired by the use of traditional building methods applied by skilled local craftsmen in areas, such as [[Costa Rica]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\nThese improvements can include non-toxic housekeeping practices, the use of renewable energy, organic soaps, energy-efficient light fixtures, and recycling programs. It is beneficial for these hotels to get certain certifications in order to be environmentally compliant. One beneficial certification specifically for hotels is the [[LEED certification]]. A LEED-certified hotel provides benefits to the environment through energy efficient practices. An eco hotel should follow a set of best practices in order to do their part to benefit the environment. Some of these best practices include serving local [[Organic food|organic]] food in restaurants, reusing linens when a guest is staying for more than one night, and incorporating in-room [[recycling]] and [[Compost|composting]] programs. Hotels that have these certifications and best practices<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Enz|first=Cathy|date=1999|title=Best Hotel Environmental Practices|url=https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1453&context=articles|journal=Best Hotel Environmental Practices|volume=|pages=1-8|via=}}</ref> can attract environmentally conscious travelers and stand out from other hotels.\n\n==Criteria==\nAn eco hotel must usually meet the following criteria:\n* Dependence on the natural environment\n* Ecological sustainability\n* Proven contribution to conservation\n* Provision of environmental training programs\n* Incorporation of cultural considerations\n* Provision of an economic return to the local community\n\n==Characteristics==\nGreen hotels follow strict green guidelines to ensure that their guests are staying in a safe, non-toxic and energy-efficient accommodation. Here are some basic characteristics of a green hotel:\n\n*Housekeeping uses non-toxic cleaning agents and laundry detergent \n*100% [[organic cotton]] sheets, towels and mattresses \n*Non-smoking environment \n*Renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy \n*Bulk organic soap and amenities instead of individual packages to reduce waste \n*Guest room and hotel lobby recycling bins \n*Towel and sheet re-use (guests can tell housekeeping to leave these slightly used items to reduce water consumption) \n*Energy-efficient lighting \n*On-site transportation with green vehicles \n*Serve organic and local-grown food\n*Non-disposable dishes\n*Offers a fresh-air exchange system\n*[[Greywater]] recycling, which is the reuse of kitchen, bath and laundry water for garden and landscaping \n*Newspaper recycling program\n\n==Definition==\nEcology is a very strong trend, either convictions or a fashion, caring for the earth has become an ideal of many. As a result, eco-hotels have become an increasingly popular alternative in the tourism industry, the increase in demand has led therefore to a large range of hotels with planet friendly options for all requirements.\n\nAccording to the Royal Spanish Academy, one of the interpretations of the term ecology includes \"defense and protection of nature and environment\" From what we understand, to be green what is sought is to defend and protect everything natural. around us. contact with nature is something almost inherent to the holiday, providing an opportunity to carry out environmental.\n\nAn ecological hotel is one that is fully integrated into the environment without damaging the environment, contributing in some way to progress and improvement of the local community and sustainable growth of the tourism industry.\n\nThe term has been used on a more regular basis as new websites devoted to the subject become more prominent and hotel owners become more interested in protecting the areas their guests have come to visit.\n\nNew properties are being built from sustainable resources\u2013tropical [[hardwood]]s, local stone\u2013and designed to better blend in with their environment. In addition, they are also being run on eco-friendly principles, such as serving [[Organic food|organic]] or [[Local food|locally grown food]] or using natural cooling as opposed to air conditioning.\n\nEcolabels are labeling systems that show the environmental impact of good and services within [[Ecolabel|regions]] around the world.\n\n===Ecolabeling of hotels in Europe===\nThe [[EU Ecolabel]] is an official sign of the environmental quality of services and goods in the European Union (EU) that is both certified by an independent organization and valid throughout the many member States of the European Union.\n\nAny tourism accommodation operator in the EU - from a large hotel chain to a small farmhouse has been able to apply for the European Eco-label since 2003.
