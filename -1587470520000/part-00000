He was the only child of Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]], the daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]] who had established Nicaea after the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was captured by the crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Theodore received excellent education from two renowned scholars, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[George Akropolites]]. He made friends with young intelectuals, especially with a page of low birth, [[George Mouzalon]]. Theodore started to write treatises on theological, historical and philosophical themes in his youth. \n\nEmperor John&nbsp;III arranged Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] to forge an alliance with her father, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;II]] in 1235. Their marriage was happy and they had at least five children. Theodore acted as his father's lieutenant in [[Asia Minor]] during his father's campaigns in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] from 1241. He became his father's co-ruler around 1242, but he was not crowned co-emperor. His relationship with [[Theodore Philes]], [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] and other aristocrats became tense during this period.\n\nTheodore succeeded his father on 4 November 1254. He dismissed many high officials and army commanders of aristocratic origin, replacing them with his commoner confidants. He made a deffensive alliance with [[Kaykaus II]], the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]], against the [[Mongol Empire]]. He repelled a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace and Macedonia and forced [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] to cede [[Dyrrachium]] on the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to Nicaea. He introduced a military reform, recruiting more soldiers from among the native peasantry of Asia Minor. Michael&nbsp;II of Epiros forged an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], and [[Manfred of Sicily]] and Theodore's newly appointed generals could not resist their joint invasion in 1257. Theodore fell seriously ill and could rarely take part in state administration during the last months of his life. He appointed George Mouzalon [[regent]] for his underage son, [[John IV Laskaris|John&nbsp;IV]] before he died of chronic [[epilepsy]] or cancer. In ten days, Mouzalon fell victim to an aristocratic plot and Michael Palaiologos assumed regency. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\n{{See also|Laskaris|Vatatzes}}\n\nTheodore was born to Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]] in the imperial palace in [[Nicaea]] in late 1221 or early 1222.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Irene was the eldest daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]], the founder of the [[Empire of Nicaea]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Nicaea was a successor state of the [[Byzantine Empire]], established after the crusaders (or Latins) [[Sack of Constantinople|captured Constantinople]]  during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=10\u201311}} Vatatzes was Irene's third husband. He was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] and [[Angelos]] dynasties. When he wed Irene, he served as the commander of the [[Vestiaritai|imperial guard]]. Although Irene's two brothers had died prematurely, Theodore&nbsp;I did not name Vatatzes as his official heir. He most likely expected that his third wife, the Latin [[Maria of Courtenay]], would bear sons, but he did not father children with her.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201334}} Theodore&nbsp;I died in November 1221. Vatatzes had to defeat the late emperor's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over his wife's uncles and their Latin allies in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]] in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way to the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nTheodore was his parents' only child. His mother suffered a horse accident and could not bear children after his birth. He adopted his mother's family name.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}  He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his unbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxory surrounding him. His childhood was joyful and he \"often received greatest solace\" from his father. He also remembered that his parents did not punish him when his tutor had accused him of misdemeanors.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=59\u201360, 257 (notes 21\u201322)}}\n\n===Education===\n\n[[File:Nicaea's Byzantine fortifications, Iznik, Turkey (37799778844).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ruins of stone walls.|Ruins of the walls of Nicaea.]]\n\nIf Theodore's formal education started at the age when most other aristocratic children were taught to write and read, he was entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228.  He had to pray three times a day and to memorize texts from the Bible. He could quote from the [[psalms]] and the [[parables of Jesus]] by heart till the end of his life.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=64\u201366}} Theodore's secondary education started around 1230. He detested his principal tutor (or ''[[baioulos]]'') and described him as a \"great babbler\" in his works, without mentioning his name. He studied grammar (that is [[Attic Greek]]), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meaning and in [[Etymology|etymologies]]. The young Theodore was captivated by the orations of [[Demosthenes]] and [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]]. He also highly esteemed the theologian [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged Theodore to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies. Theodore was a passionate hunter and [[polo]] player with remarkable riding skills.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=68\u201372, 75\u201377}}\n\nNegotiations about Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] started shortly after the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]]. In the battle, her father, Emperor (or Tzar) [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Emperor of Thessalonica]] and ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], early in 1230. The battle weakened Nicaea's rival for the revival of the Byzantine Empire, Epirus, and made [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] the dominant power of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=738}} The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] in 1235. Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid [[Siege of Constantinople (1235)|siege to Constantinople]], but could not capture the city. Ivan Asen did a ''[[volte-face]]'', allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace in 1237, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore  for the rest of his life that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=65, 73\u201375}}\n\nTheodore approached a most renowned teacher, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]], to take classes of philosophy from him. Blemmydes was the [[hegumen]] (or head) of a monastery at [[Ephesus]]. Theodore attended his classes of philosophy while he was staying in his father's winter palace at the nearby [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]]. Blemmydes' zealous [[Aristotelianism]] had a strong impact on Theodore who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like [[potentiality and actuality]], in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of [[embezzlement]] by one of his students. Vatatzes' intervention saved him of imprisonment, but he abandoned teaching early in the 1240s. Theodore continued to regularly visit Blemmydes and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholar from Constantinople, [[George Akropolites]], replaced Blemmydes as Theodore's principal tutor. He had first hand experiences about the Latin rule in the city. He was a secretary, working in the imperial court, and he completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=79, 85, 117\u2013118}}\n\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=88}} Vatatzes re-married in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Anna of Hohenstaufen|Constanza]] whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. Marchesina was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Rule==\n\n===His father's co-ruler===\n\nIf Theodore's father adopted his predecessors' practice, Theodore was still a child when he was made his father's co-emperor. [[George Akropolites]] mentioned Theodore as a Co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was most probably not crowned during his father's life\u2014that is why two later Byzantine historians, [[George Pachymeres]] and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], denied that he had been a co-emperor.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=61, 258 (notes 34 and 36)}}\n\nVatatzes [[Siege of Constantinople (1241)|besieged Constantinople]] in May and June 1241, but he could not capture it. Theodore participated in the subsequent negotiations with the Latins which ended with a two-year truce on 24 June. The death of Theodore's father-in-law around the same time weakened Bulgaria. Taking advantage of the situation, Vatatzes launched a military campaign against Epirus, appointing Theodore his lieutenant in Anatolia. A Mongol general, [[Baiju Noyan|Baiju]], [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|invaded]] the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] in eastern Anatolia and captured [[Erzerum]]. On hearing of the Mongol invasion, Theodore sent envoys to his father, who was besieging [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], but Vatatzes abandoned the siege only after the ruler of the city, [[John Komnenos Doukas]], renounced the title of emperor and swore fealty to him. The Mongols made a new military campaign against Rum and routed Sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] on 26 June 1243. The Seljuks of Rum were forced to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols. Nicaea remained the only Anatolian state that could maintain its full independence of the Mongols, but the fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=720\u2013721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nVatatzes departed for a new military campaign in the Balkans in 1246, leaving Theodore in charge of the administration of Anatolia. After Vatatzes' capture of Serres, Thessalonica and Melnik voluntarily surrendered and Vatatzes expanded his rule as far as northern Macedonia, thus almost doubling his empire's territory.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 96\u201397}} As his father's co-ruler, Theodore received delegations and discussed state matters either together with his father or alone. The reception of petitions from clergymen, aristocrats and commoners was part of his daily routine. Blemmydes' petitions show that Theodore's authority was considerable: he could grant estates and salaries and he could intervene in legal disputes, even ordering the metropolitan of Epirus to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery after it refunded the price. His authority to preside over the privy council in his father absence and to propose candidates to Church offices is also documented. Similarly to his grandfather and father, Theodore held an itinerant court and visited most Anatolian towns and villages.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=98\u2013102}}\n\nA bond of close friendship was forged between Theodore and a circle of young intelectuals during his co-emperorship. They were all born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, without experiencing the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch [[Germanus II of Constantinople]] referred to them). Theodore's writings reveal that his friends' companion helped him to come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, [[George Mouzalon]], had been a page in his childhood entourage. Blemmydes noted that George and his two brothers, Theodore and Andronikos Mouzalon, were \"of despicably low birth\". They were talented singers and musicians who regularly appeared in musical performances in the imperial court. Other confidants of his, like [[Joseph Mesopotamites]] and [[Konstas Hagiotheodorites]], were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=109\u2013118}}\n\nIn his correspondence with his friends, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggradizement, their barbarian speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance. Theodore was also object of mockery: his unnamed fellow students teased him for his arguments in philosophical discussions. Critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous. The [[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], rebuked Theodore for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of [[fasting]]. A military commander, Kalothetos, often spoke of Theodore without respect. Relationship between Theodore and his father's governor at Thessalonica, [[Theodore Philes]], was extremly tense. Philes circulated deflamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman and Theodore blamed Philes for the murder of Theodore's friend, Tribides. Tribides' fate shows that Theodore started sending his confidants to the newly conquered European territories already during his father's reign. Philes' accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes who did not tolerate sexual misconduct. Blemmydes had recently, around 1248, denied entry Marchesina and her retinue to his monastery at Ephesus. Now, he addressed a mirror of princes, entitled ''Imperial Statue'', to Vatatzes and Theodore, warning them against lechery and the dissipation of public funds. Theodore denied the charges in a series of letters to his former tutor. Theodore also hold a grudge against his second cousin, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], for unknown reason.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90, 118\u2013125}}\n\nVatatzes launched a military campaign against the ruler of Epirus, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], in March of April 1252. Before his depature, he appointed Theodore his viceroy in Anatolia. Elena of Bulgaria unexpectedly before the end of the summer. He mourned for his wife for more than the customary fourty days and only abandoned fasting and wearing black on his father's order. His wife's death intensified his melancholy and he dedicated more time to philosophical studies and writing. He resumed his regular visits of the Anatolian towns in 1253.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 128\u2013132}}\n\nEmperor Frederick&nbsp;II's son and successor, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], forced most relatives of his father's mistress, [[Bianca Lancia]], into exile early in 1253. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum in the court of Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Theodore received the exiles in one of the imperial palaces. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite [[Berthold of Hohenburg]], an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to start negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Europe, Theodore and Berthold made philosophical conversations. Interest in ancient philosophy had intensified in Europe. Berthold and the philosophers and phycisians in his retinue wanted to take advantage of his diplomatic mission and asked Theodore to grant Greek philosophical works to them. Their request reinforced Theodore's pride of Hellenism. He also decided to prepare manuscript editions of his philosophical works.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=140\u2013145}}\n\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell suddenly ill and he never fully recovered. His illnes made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire, but the change of his position did not prevented him from making arrangements for the publications of his works. News about preparations for a new Mongol invasion of Anatolia reached Nicaea, causing concern in the imperial court.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n===Sole emperor===\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4 November 1254. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he could not be crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Acropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans  to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"[[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]\" of the [[Book of Exodus]], guiding the [[Israelites]]. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, [[Kaykaus II]], in [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]], and they concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols shortly after his ascension to the throne. Kaykaus acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but failed to pay homage to the Great Khan [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] personally.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|p=721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe appointment of a new patriarch was also a main concern for Theodore. He wanted to achieve the appointment of Blemmydes, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, [[Arsenius Autoreianus|Arsenios Autoreianos]], was a hermit of aristocratic background. Arsenios accepted the offer and he was ordained patriarch. As his first act, the new Patriarch crowned and annointed Theodore emperor\u2014according to scholarly consensus, on Christmas 1254. Arsenios' allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=150, 296 (note 25)}} Arsenios was Theodore's loyal supporter and obeyed his commands.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}}\n\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\" in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254, without naming his opponents. Historian [[Michael Angold]] proposes that Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's similary policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\".{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=748}} Theodore appointed George to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new ''[[megas domestikos]]''. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new ''[[protovestiarites]]'' (or commander of the guards of the imperial palace). He also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, [[Constantine Margarites]]. His appointments offended the military aristocracy of the empire. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n[[Michael II Asen]], the young Tzar of Bulgaria, exploited Vatatzes' death and invaded Thrace and Macedonia in December 1254 or January 1255.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Nicaean garrisons at most Thracian and Macedonian fortresses were small and the local Bulgarians did not resist the invaders.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Bulgarian troops seized Thracian fortresses and two Macedonian towns, [[Veles, North Macedonia|Veles]] and [[Skopje]], on the river [[Vardar]]. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal about an immediate counter-attack. Theodore assembled an army and departed for Adrianople in February 1255, charging Mouzalon with the administration of Anatolia. His surprise attack forced the Bulgarian to withdraw from Thrace and he appointed two aristocrats, [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] and [[Demetrios Torinikes]] to continue the military campaign against the Bulgarians. While marching across the passes of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], the two generals mistook the sounds of the horns of shepherds ans swineherds with signals of an ambush. They fled in panic, abandoning their baggage. Their fiasco outraged Theodore who ordered them to return, but Strategopoulos and Torinikes disobeyed.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\nA Bulgarian renegate in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer of 1255. Theodore departed from Adrianople to Melnik. He avoided the ambush that the Bulgarians had lain along the [[Rupel Pass]] before reaching Melnik and forcing Dragotas to abandon the siege. He visited Thessalonica where he dismissed Philes, Strategopoulos and Torinikes. He also closed down the local mint and established a new treasury in Astritzion on the Asian coast of the [[Hellespont]], because he wanted to concentrate the administration of his finances in Anatolia instead of the rebellious Balkans. Theodore invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from marching across the [[Ov\u010de Pole]], forcing him to return to Serres. He confirmed the nearby towns' fiscal privileges, but he ordered the arrest of [[Constantine Kabasila]], [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], assuming that Kabasila was Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus' loyal supporter.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=156\u2013159}}\n\nA report about a Mongol invasion of Anatolia forced him to leave Macedonia in late autumn. He hurried to Adrianople where he realized that the report was distorted. Theodore launched an attack against the fortress of [[Tzepaina]], but his army could not cross the narrow and frosty passes of the Rhodope and Theodore returned to Anatolia at the end of 1255. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commander-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with the implementation of military reforms. On the other hand, members of old aristocratic families were punished. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes were blinded, while Alexios Strategopoulos and [[Alexios Raoul]]'s four sons were imprisoned. Michael Palaiologos fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. He take advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married a niece of Michael Palaiologos, [[Theodora Raoulaina|Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina]], his brother, Andronikos, wed a daughter of [[Alexios Raoul]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=159\u2013162, 169}}\n\nTheodore resumed negotiations about the [[church union]] in April or May 1256. He sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander IV]], offering his mediation between the Pope and the Patriarch. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had adopted different views about the procession of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Orthodox theologians maintained that the [[Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding the Filioque|Holy Spirit procceeded from the Father alone]], while Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the [[God the Father|Father]] [[filioque|and the Son]]. Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, saying that the Bible and the [[Church Fathers]] suggested that the Holy Spirit processed from the Father through the [[God the Son|Son]], but Theodore insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine. The Pope sent Constantine, [[Bishop of Orvieto]], as his legate to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nMichael&nbsp;II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to keep a defensive strategy. They ignored his instruction and chased the Cumans, who inflicted a heavy defeat on the Nicaean troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and the Nicaean troops defeated the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II with the mediation of [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]], [[Banate of Macs\u00f3|Duke of Macs\u00f3]]. Michael&nbsp;II had recently married Rostislav's daughter and Rostislav's wife, [[Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs\u00f3|Anna of Hungary]], was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael&nbsp;II's behalf on 29 June. The treaty prescribed Michael&nbsp;II to cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites in a fit of anger. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\nFrom Thrace, Theodore went to Thessalonica where he entered into negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus's wife, [[Theodora of Arta|Theodora Petraliphaina]]. To secure a lasting peace with Nicaea and avoid imprisonment, she agreed to cede [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Dyrrachium]] to Theodore, establishing the Nicaean control of the [[Via Egnatia]]. Theodore married off his daughter, Maria to the heir to the Epirote throne, [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros Komnenos Doukas]], in October, but his territorial demands alienated Michael&nbsp;II.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=160}} Theodore also received the papal legate, but their negotiations proved fruitless and Constantine of Orvieto died during his journey back to Italy.

On learning of the Mongol invasion, Theodore hurried back to Anatolia. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, [[Kilij Arslan IV]], as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc]] sent an embassy to Theodore and he persuaded the Ilkhan to withdraw his army from Anatolia. H\u00fcleg\u00fc also allowed Kaykaus to return to Rum, ordering the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and his brother in the spring of 1257. Theodore concluded an agreement with Kaykaus who ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]] to him in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops from Nicaea.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=721\u2013722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\nBulgaria fell into a state of anarchy.

Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael&nbsp;II's brother-in-law, [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso]], laid claim to the throne, but most boyars offered their allegiance to one of their number, [[Konstantin Tih]], although he was not related to the [[Asen dynasty]]. Theodore's daughters by Elena were Tzar Ivan Asen&nbsp;II's granddaughters. Konstantin reputiated his wife and sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]].

He proadly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Do\u011fanyurt|Cape Karambis]] on the [[Black Sea]]. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him that he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries. Theodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. [[George Pachymeres]], who was less than sixteen around that time, diagnozed his illness as epilepsy. Akropolites and Blemmydes did not mention epilepsy. Akropolites only mentioned that Theodore lost weight and \"his entire body was reduced to a skeleton\". In a letter to Blemmydes, Theodore wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arm. His illness cannot identified certainly, but it could be epilepsy of the grand-mal type or cancer of the brain, the spine or the lungs. He could no more command his troops personally.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=172\u2013174, 176, 381\u2013383}} \n\nIn Macedonia, Theodore had dismissed the commanders of noble origin with close family ties to the local aristocracy with Anatolian officers of humble origin. His appointees, however, could not resist after Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus had incited the local Albanian chiefs to a rebellion in late 1256. He also made an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], who intervened in the conflict and defeated Theodore's local commander, Xyleas, near [[Prilep]]. An other newly appointed Nicaean commander, [[Constantine Chabaron]], was trapped, allegedly through love letters that Michael&nbsp;II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphina, had sent to him. Theodore sent an army of peasant soldiers to Macedonia, but they were routed at [[Edessa|Edessa, Greece]]. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, lead a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael&nbsp;II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites. Michael&nbsp;II was planning to launch an attack against Thessalonica, but Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's illegitimate son, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], who had taken control of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] after the death of his stepbrother, Conrad, invaded Epirus from the west. Michael&nbsp;II who did not want to abandon his plan concluded an alliance with Manfred. Manfred captured Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=175\u2013176}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}\n\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He became convinced that sorcery had caused his illness. Theodore had forced Michael Palaiologos's niece, Theodore to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios. The marriage was never consummated and Kaballarios accused Theodora's, Maria-Martha Palaiologna, of witchcraft. She was publicly humilated and tortured. Although she did not confess, Theodore ordered the imprisonment of her brother, Michael Palaiologos, for a while. Theodore named his seven-year-old son, [[John IV Laskaris|John]], as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. He became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16 August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on [[Mount Sipylus]]. His grave and the monastery was destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nThe aristocrats had taken an oath of loyalty to Mouzalon at Theodore's deathbed, but they soon began conspiring against him. In ten days, Mouzalon was murdered and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency for the child-emperor, John&nbsp;IV Laskaris. Palaiologos convinced the aristocrats that an empire ruled by a boy could not resist enemy attacks and he was proclaimed emperor as Michael&nbsp;VIII before the end of the year. Early in 1259, Michael&nbsp;VIII and John&nbsp;IV were crowned together. The Patriarch put the crown first on Michael&nbsp;VIII's head. After concluding an agreement with Genoa against the Latin Empire, he dispatched Alexios Strategopoulos to spy out the defences of Constantinople. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Latin army, Strategopoulos seized Constantinople by a surprise attack on 25 July 1261. Michael&nbsp;VIII was crowned for the second time alone in the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=29\u201336}} The child John&nbsp;IV was blinded on 25 December 1261, because blindness disabled him to rule.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=65}} His three unmarried sisters were married off to Italian and Bulgarian noblemen, because Michael&nbsp;VIII wanted to demonstrate that the Laskarids had lost their imperial status.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nInternally, Theodore favored bureaucrats from the middle classes instead of members of the great aristocratic families. Michael Angold explains this as in part, a matter of his temperament:\n: He [Theodore] was happier in the company of a cultivated circle of friends, some of whom had been his childhood companions (''paidopoula''). He clearly disliked what he considered the philistinism prevalent among a section of the young men at his father's court.<ref>Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'' (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 76</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\n\nTheodore was a scholar and transformed his court into a center of a scholars. He also ordered that books that he and his father had collected in urban libraries be available to all who wanted to read them.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=106}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}} \n\n==Family==\n\nNeither Theodore nor Elena reached the minimum legal age of marriage\u2014fourteen for boys and twelfe for girls\u2014when they were married, but such an early marriage was not unique among Nicaean aristocrats and commoners. She was born to Ivan Asen&nbsp;II and [[Anna Maria of Hungary|Maria of Hungary]] in 1224. The wedding took place at Lampsakos early in 1235. Two years later, before launching an invasion of Nicaean territories in Thrace, her father forced Elena to return to Bulgaria, but peace was restored between the two empires and Elena returned to Theodore before the end of the year. Years later, Theodore described Elena as the flower of his youth and stated that their \"bond of incomparable love\" made them \"happier than all people\". Her sudden death in the spring or summer of 1252 plunged Theodore into grief. She gave birth to four or five daughters, and one son.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=72\u201375}} Their children are the following:\n*[[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]] who married [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria]] was Emperor Michael&nbsp;VIII's implacable enemy until her death around 1270.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=67}}\n*Maria who married [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros I of Epirus]] deceased between early in 1257 and 1265.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=68}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=169}}\n*Theodora was married off by Michael&nbsp;VIII to a [[Morea|Morean]] nobleman, ''Ma\u00efos D\u00e9b\u00e9likourtos'', according to Pachymeres and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].

He was the only child of Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]], the daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]] who had established Nicaea after the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was captured by the crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Theodore received excellent education from two renowned scholars, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[George Akropolites]]. He made friends with young intelectuals, especially with a page of low birth, [[George Mouzalon]]. Theodore started to write treatises on theological, historical and philosophical themes in his youth. \n\nEmperor John&nbsp;III arranged Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] to forge an alliance with her father, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;II]] in 1235. Their marriage was happy and they had at least five children. Theodore acted as his father's lieutenant in [[Asia Minor]] during his father's campaigns in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] from 1241. He became his father's co-ruler around 1242, but he was not crowned co-emperor. His relationship with [[Theodore Philes]], [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] and other aristocrats became tense during this period.\n\nTheodore succeeded his father on 4 November 1254. He dismissed many high officials and army commanders of aristocratic origin, replacing them with his commoner confidants. He made a deffensive alliance with [[Kaykaus II]], the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]], against the [[Mongol Empire]]. He repelled a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace and Macedonia and forced [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] to cede [[Dyrrachium]] on the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to Nicaea. He introduced a military reform, recruiting more soldiers from among the native peasantry of Asia Minor. Michael&nbsp;II of Epiros forged an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], and [[Manfred of Sicily]] and Theodore's newly appointed generals could not resist their joint invasion in 1257. Theodore fell seriously ill and could rarely take part in state administration during the last months of his life. He appointed George Mouzalon [[regent]] for his underage son, [[John IV Laskaris|John&nbsp;IV]] before he died of chronic [[epilepsy]] or cancer. In ten days, Mouzalon fell victim to an aristocratic plot and Michael Palaiologos assumed regency. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\n{{See also|Laskaris|Vatatzes}}\n\nTheodore was born to Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]] in the imperial palace in [[Nicaea]] in late 1221 or early 1222.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Irene was the eldest daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]], the founder of the [[Empire of Nicaea]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Nicaea was a successor state of the [[Byzantine Empire]], established after the crusaders (or Latins) [[Sack of Constantinople|captured Constantinople]]  during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=10\u201311}} Vatatzes was Irene's third husband. He was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] and [[Angelos]] dynasties. When he wed Irene, he served as the commander of the [[Vestiaritai|imperial guard]]. Although Irene's two brothers had died prematurely, Theodore&nbsp;I did not name Vatatzes as his official heir. He most likely expected that his third wife, the Latin [[Maria of Courtenay]], would bear sons, but he did not father children with her.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201334}} Theodore&nbsp;I died in November 1221. Vatatzes had to defeat the late emperor's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over his wife's uncles and their Latin allies in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]] in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way to the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nTheodore was his parents' only child. His mother suffered a horse accident and could not bear children after his birth. He adopted his mother's family name.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}  He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his unbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxory surrounding him. His childhood was joyful and he \"often received greatest solace\" from his father. He also remembered that his parents did not punish him when his tutor had accused him of misdemeanors.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=59\u201360, 257 (notes 21\u201322)}}\n\n===Education===\n\n[[File:Nicaea's Byzantine fortifications, Iznik, Turkey (37799778844).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ruins of stone walls.|Ruins of the walls of Nicaea.]]\n\nIf Theodore's formal education started at the age when most other aristocratic children were taught to write and read, he was entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228.  He had to pray three times a day and to memorize texts from the Bible. He could quote from the [[psalms]] and the [[parables of Jesus]] by heart till the end of his life.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=64\u201366}} Theodore's secondary education started around 1230. He detested his principal tutor (or ''[[baioulos]]'') and described him as a \"great babbler\" in his works, without mentioning his name. He studied grammar (that is [[Attic Greek]]), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meaning and in [[Etymology|etymologies]]. The young Theodore was captivated by the orations of [[Demosthenes]] and [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]]. He also highly esteemed the theologian [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged Theodore to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies. Theodore was a passionate hunter and [[polo]] player with remarkable riding skills.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=68\u201372, 75\u201377}}\n\nNegotiations about Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] started shortly after the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]]. In the battle, her father, Emperor (or Tzar) [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Emperor of Thessalonica]] and ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], early in 1230. The battle weakened Nicaea's rival for the revival of the Byzantine Empire, Epirus, and made [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] the dominant power of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=738}} The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] in 1235. Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid [[Siege of Constantinople (1235)|siege to Constantinople]], but could not capture the city. Ivan Asen did a ''[[volte-face]]'', allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace in 1237, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore  for the rest of his life that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=65, 73\u201375}}\n\nTheodore approached a most renowned teacher, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]], to take classes of philosophy from him. Blemmydes was the [[hegumen]] (or head) of a monastery at [[Ephesus]]. Theodore attended his classes of philosophy while he was staying in his father's winter palace at the nearby [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]]. Blemmydes' zealous [[Aristotelianism]] had a strong impact on Theodore who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like [[potentiality and actuality]], in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of [[embezzlement]] by one of his students. Vatatzes' intervention saved him of imprisonment, but he abandoned teaching early in the 1240s. Theodore continued to regularly visit Blemmydes and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholar from Constantinople, [[George Akropolites]], replaced Blemmydes as Theodore's principal tutor. He had first hand experiences about the Latin rule in the city. He was an imperial secretary, mainly staying in the imperial court, and he completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=79, 85, 117\u2013118}}\n\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=88}} Vatatzes re-married in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Anna of Hohenstaufen|Constanza]] whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. Marchesina was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Rule==\n\n===His father's co-ruler===\n\nIf Theodore's father adopted his predecessors' practice, Theodore was still a child when he was made his father's co-emperor. [[George Akropolites]] mentioned Theodore as a Co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was most probably not crowned during his father's life\u2014that is why two later Byzantine historians, [[George Pachymeres]] and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], denied that he had been a co-emperor.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=61, 258 (notes 34 and 36)}}\n\nVatatzes [[Siege of Constantinople (1241)|besieged Constantinople]] in May and June 1241, but he could not capture it. Theodore participated in the subsequent negotiations with the Latins which ended with a two-year truce on 24 June. The death of Theodore's father-in-law around the same time weakened Bulgaria. Taking advantage of the situation, Vatatzes launched a military campaign against Epirus, appointing Theodore his lieutenant in Anatolia. A Mongol general, [[Baiju Noyan|Baiju]], [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|invaded]] the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] in eastern Anatolia and captured [[Erzerum]]. On hearing of the Mongol invasion, Theodore sent envoys to his father, who was besieging [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], but Vatatzes abandoned the siege only after the ruler of the city, [[John Komnenos Doukas]], renounced the title of emperor and swore fealty to him. The Mongols made a new military campaign against Rum and routed Sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] on 26 June 1243. The Seljuks of Rum were forced to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols. Nicaea remained the only Anatolian state that could maintain its full independence of the Mongols, but the fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=720\u2013721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nVatatzes departed for a new military campaign in the Balkans in 1246, leaving Theodore in charge of the administration of Anatolia. After Vatatzes' capture of Serres, Thessalonica and Melnik voluntarily surrendered and Vatatzes expanded his rule as far as northern Macedonia, thus almost doubling his empire's territory.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 96\u201397}} As his father's co-ruler, Theodore received delegations and discussed state matters either together with his father or alone. The reception of petitions from clergymen, aristocrats and commoners was part of his daily routine. Blemmydes' petitions show that Theodore's authority was considerable: he could grant estates and salaries and he could intervene in legal disputes, even ordering the metropolitan of Epirus to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery after it refunded the price. His authority to preside over the privy council in his father absence and to propose candidates to Church offices is also documented. Similarly to his grandfather and father, Theodore held an itinerant court and visited most Anatolian towns and villages.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=98\u2013102}}\n\nA bond of close friendship was forged between Theodore and a circle of young intelectuals during his co-emperorship. They were all born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, without experiencing the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch [[Germanus II of Constantinople]] referred to them). Theodore's writings reveal that his friends' companion helped him to come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, [[George Mouzalon]], had been a page in his childhood entourage. Blemmydes noted that George and his two brothers, Theodore and Andronikos Mouzalon, were \"of despicably low birth\". They were talented singers and musicians who regularly appeared in musical performances in the imperial court. Other confidants of his, like [[Joseph Mesopotamites]] and [[Konstas Hagiotheodorites]], were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=109\u2013118}}\n\nIn his correspondence with his friends, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggradizement, their barbarian speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance. Theodore was also object of mockery: his unnamed fellow students teased him for his arguments in philosophical discussions. Critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous. The [[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], rebuked Theodore for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of [[fasting]]. A military commander, Kalothetos, often spoke of Theodore without respect. Relationship between Theodore and his father's governor at Thessalonica, [[Theodore Philes]], was extremly tense. Philes circulated deflamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman and Theodore blamed Philes for the murder of Theodore's friend, Tribides. Tribides' fate shows that Theodore started sending his confidants to the newly conquered European territories already during his father's reign. Philes' accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes who did not tolerate sexual misconduct. Blemmydes had recently, around 1248, denied entry Marchesina and her retinue to his monastery at Ephesus. Now, he addressed a mirror of princes, entitled ''Imperial Statue'', to Vatatzes and Theodore, warning them against lechery and the dissipation of public funds. Theodore denied the charges in a series of letters to his former tutor. Theodore also hold a grudge against his second cousin, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], for unknown reason.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90, 118\u2013125}}\n\nVatatzes launched a military campaign against the ruler of Epirus, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], in March of April 1252. Before his depature, he appointed Theodore his viceroy in Anatolia. Elena of Bulgaria unexpectedly before the end of the summer. He mourned for his wife for more than the customary fourty days and only abandoned fasting and wearing black on his father's order. His wife's death intensified his melancholy and he dedicated more time to philosophical studies and writing. He resumed his regular visits of the Anatolian towns in 1253.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 128\u2013132}}\n\nEmperor Frederick&nbsp;II's son and successor, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], forced most relatives of his father's mistress, [[Bianca Lancia]], into exile early in 1253. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum in the court of Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Theodore received the exiles in one of the imperial palaces. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite [[Berthold of Hohenburg]], an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to start negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Europe, Theodore and Berthold made philosophical conversations. Interest in ancient philosophy had intensified in Europe. Berthold and the philosophers and phycisians in his retinue wanted to take advantage of his diplomatic mission and asked Theodore to grant Greek philosophical works to them. Their request reinforced Theodore's pride of Hellenism. He also decided to prepare manuscript editions of his philosophical works.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=140\u2013145}}\n\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell suddenly ill and he never fully recovered. His illnes made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire, but the change of his position did not prevented him from making arrangements for the publications of his works. News about preparations for a new Mongol invasion of Anatolia reached Nicaea, causing concern in the imperial court.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n===Sole emperor===\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4 November 1254. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he could not be crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Acropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans  to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"[[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]\" of the [[Book of Exodus]], guiding the [[Israelites]]. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, [[Kaykaus II]], in [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]], and they concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols shortly after his ascension to the throne. Kaykaus acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but failed to pay homage to the Great Khan [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] personally.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|p=721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe appointment of a new patriarch was also a main concern for Theodore. He wanted to achieve the appointment of Blemmydes, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, [[Arsenius Autoreianus|Arsenios Autoreianos]], was a hermit of aristocratic background. Arsenios accepted the offer and he was ordained patriarch. As his first act, the new Patriarch crowned and annointed Theodore emperor\u2014according to scholarly consensus, on Christmas 1254. Arsenios' allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=150, 296 (note 25)}} Arsenios was Theodore's loyal supporter and obeyed his commands.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}}\n\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\" in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254, without naming his opponents. Historian [[Michael Angold]] proposes that Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's similary policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\".{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=748}} Theodore appointed George to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new ''[[megas domestikos]]''. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new ''[[protovestiarites]]'' (or commander of the guards of the imperial palace). He also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, [[Constantine Margarites]]. His appointments offended the military aristocracy of the empire. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n[[Michael II Asen]], the young Tzar of Bulgaria, exploited Vatatzes' death and invaded Thrace and Macedonia in December 1254 or January 1255.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Nicaean garrisons at most Thracian and Macedonian fortresses were small and the local Bulgarians did not resist the invaders.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Bulgarian troops seized Thracian fortresses and two Macedonian towns, [[Veles, North Macedonia|Veles]] and [[Skopje]], on the river [[Vardar]]. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal about an immediate counter-attack. Theodore assembled an army and departed for Adrianople in February 1255, charging Mouzalon with the administration of Anatolia. His surprise attack forced the Bulgarian to withdraw from Thrace and he appointed two aristocrats, [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] and [[Demetrios Torinikes]] to continue the military campaign against the Bulgarians. While marching across the passes of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], the two generals mistook the sounds of the horns of shepherds ans swineherds with signals of an ambush. They fled in panic, abandoning their baggage. Their fiasco outraged Theodore who ordered them to return, but Strategopoulos and Torinikes disobeyed.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\nA Bulgarian renegate in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer of 1255. Theodore departed from Adrianople to Melnik. He avoided the ambush that the Bulgarians had lain along the [[Rupel Pass]] before reaching Melnik and forcing Dragotas to abandon the siege. He visited Thessalonica where he dismissed Philes, Strategopoulos and Torinikes. He also closed down the local mint and established a new treasury in Astritzion on the Asian coast of the [[Hellespont]], because he wanted to concentrate the administration of his finances in Anatolia instead of the rebellious Balkans. Theodore invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from marching across the [[Ov\u010de Pole]], forcing him to return to Serres. He confirmed the nearby towns' fiscal privileges, but he ordered the arrest of [[Constantine Kabasila]], [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], assuming that Kabasila was Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus' loyal supporter.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=156\u2013159}}\n\nA report about a Mongol invasion of Anatolia forced him to leave Macedonia in late autumn. He hurried to Adrianople where he realized that the report was distorted. Theodore launched an attack against the fortress of [[Tzepaina]], but his army could not cross the narrow and frosty passes of the Rhodope and Theodore returned to Anatolia at the end of 1255. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commander-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with the implementation of military reforms. On the other hand, members of old aristocratic families were punished. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes were blinded, while Alexios Strategopoulos and [[Alexios Raoul]]'s four sons were imprisoned. Michael Palaiologos fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. He take advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married a niece of Michael Palaiologos, [[Theodora Raoulaina|Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina]], his brother, Andronikos, wed a daughter of [[Alexios Raoul]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=159\u2013162, 169}}\n\nTheodore resumed negotiations about the [[church union]] in April or May 1256. He sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander IV]], offering his mediation between the Pope and the Patriarch. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had adopted different views about the procession of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Orthodox theologians maintained that the [[Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding the Filioque|Holy Spirit procceeded from the Father alone]], while Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the [[God the Father|Father]] [[filioque|and the Son]]. Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, saying that the Bible and the [[Church Fathers]] suggested that the Holy Spirit processed from the Father through the [[God the Son|Son]], but Theodore insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine. The Pope sent Constantine, [[Bishop of Orvieto]], as his legate to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nMichael&nbsp;II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to keep a defensive strategy. They ignored his instruction and chased the Cumans, who inflicted a heavy defeat on the Nicaean troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and the Nicaean troops defeated the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II with the mediation of [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]], [[Banate of Macs\u00f3|Duke of Macs\u00f3]]. Michael&nbsp;II had recently married Rostislav's daughter and Rostislav's wife, [[Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs\u00f3|Anna of Hungary]], was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael&nbsp;II's behalf on 29 June. The treaty prescribed Michael&nbsp;II to cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites in a fit of anger. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\nFrom Thrace, Theodore went to Thessalonica where he entered into negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus's wife, [[Theodora of Arta|Theodora Petraliphaina]]. To secure a lasting peace with Nicaea and avoid imprisonment, she agreed to cede [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Dyrrachium]] to Theodore, establishing the Nicaean control of the [[Via Egnatia]]. Theodore married off his daughter, Maria to the heir to the Epirote throne, [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros Komnenos Doukas]], in October, but his territorial demands alienated Michael&nbsp;II.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=160}} Theodore also received the papal legate, but their negotiations proved fruitless and Constantine of Orvieto died during his journey back to Italy. Theodore maintained a correspondence with powerful [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], like [[Richard Annibaldi]], [[Peter Capoccio]] and [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]], but he refused to make concessions for the church union.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=169}}\n\nThe Mongols invaded Anatolia and defeated Kaykaus&nbsp;II on 14 October 1256. On learning of the Mongol invasion, Theodore hurried back to Anatolia. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, [[Kilij Arslan IV]], as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc]] sent an embassy to Theodore and he persuaded the Ilkhan to withdraw his army from Anatolia. H\u00fcleg\u00fc also allowed Kaykaus to return to Rum, ordering the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and his brother in the spring of 1257. Theodore concluded an agreement with Kaykaus who ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]] to him in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops from Nicaea.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=721\u2013722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\nBulgaria fell into a state of anarchy. Michael&nbsp;II was dethroned by his cousin, [[Kaliman Asen II of Bulgaria|Kaliman&nbsp;II]], but Kaliman was murdered by [[boyar]]s (or noblemen). Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael&nbsp;II's brother-in-law, [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso]], laid claim to the throne, but most boyars offered their allegiance to one of their number, [[Konstantin Tih]], although he was not related to the [[Asen dynasty]]. Theodore's daughters by Elena were Tzar Ivan Asen&nbsp;II's granddaughters. Konstantin reputiated his wife and sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]]. Theodore agreed and sent her to Bulgaria to marry the Tzar.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=172}}\n\nTheodore was complacent after his achievements. He proadly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Do\u011fanyurt|Cape Karambis]] on the [[Black Sea]]. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him that he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries. Theodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. [[George Pachymeres]], who was less than sixteen around that time, diagnozed his illness as epilepsy. Akropolites and Blemmydes did not mention epilepsy. Akropolites only mentioned that Theodore lost weight and \"his entire body was reduced to a skeleton\". In a letter to Blemmydes, Theodore wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arm. His illness cannot identified certainly, but it could be epilepsy of the grand-mal type or cancer of the brain, the spine or the lungs. He could no more command his troops personally.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=172\u2013174, 176, 381\u2013383}} \n\nIn Macedonia, Theodore had dismissed the commanders of noble origin with close family ties to the local aristocracy with Anatolian officers of humble origin. His appointees, however, could not resist after Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus had incited the local Albanian chiefs to a rebellion in late 1256. He also made an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], who intervened in the conflict and defeated Theodore's local commander, Xyleas, near [[Prilep]]. An other newly appointed Nicaean commander, [[Constantine Chabaron]], was trapped, allegedly through love letters that Michael&nbsp;II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphina, had sent to him. Theodore sent an army of peasant soldiers to Macedonia, but they were routed at [[Edessa|Edessa, Greece]]. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, lead a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael&nbsp;II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites. Michael&nbsp;II was planning to launch an attack against Thessalonica, but Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's illegitimate son, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], who had taken control of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] after the death of his stepbrother, Conrad, invaded Epirus from the west. Michael&nbsp;II who did not want to abandon his plan concluded an alliance with Manfred. Manfred captured Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=175\u2013176}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}\n\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He became convinced that sorcery had caused his illness. Theodore had forced Michael Palaiologos's niece, Theodore to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios. The marriage was never consummated and Kaballarios accused Theodora's, Maria-Martha Palaiologna, of witchcraft. She was publicly humilated and tortured. Although she did not confess, Theodore ordered the imprisonment of her brother, Michael Palaiologos, for a while. Theodore named his seven-year-old son, [[John IV Laskaris|John]], as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. He became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16 August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on [[Mount Sipylus]]. His grave and the monastery was destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nThe aristocrats had taken an oath of loyalty to Mouzalon at Theodore's deathbed, but they soon began conspiring against him. In ten days, Mouzalon was murdered and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency for the child-emperor, John&nbsp;IV Laskaris. Palaiologos convinced the aristocrats that an empire ruled by a boy could not resist enemy attacks and he was proclaimed emperor as Michael&nbsp;VIII before the end of the year. Early in 1259, Michael&nbsp;VIII and John&nbsp;IV were crowned together. The Patriarch put the crown first on Michael&nbsp;VIII's head. After concluding an agreement with Genoa against the Latin Empire, he dispatched Alexios Strategopoulos to spy out the defences of Constantinople. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Latin army, Strategopoulos seized Constantinople by a surprise attack on 25 July 1261. Michael&nbsp;VIII was crowned for the second time alone in the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=29\u201336}} The child John&nbsp;IV was blinded on 25 December 1261, because blindness disabled him to rule.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=65}} His three unmarried sisters were married off to Italian and Bulgarian noblemen, because Michael&nbsp;VIII wanted to demonstrate that the Laskarids had lost their imperial status.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nInternally, Theodore favored bureaucrats from the middle classes instead of members of the great aristocratic families. Michael Angold explains this as in part, a matter of his temperament:\n: He [Theodore] was happier in the company of a cultivated circle of friends, some of whom had been his childhood companions (''paidopoula''). He clearly disliked what he considered the philistinism prevalent among a section of the young men at his father's court.<ref>Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'' (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 76</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\n\nTheodore was a scholar and transformed his court into a center of a scholars. He also ordered that books that he and his father had collected in urban libraries be available to all who wanted to read them.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=106}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}} \n\n==Family==\n\nNeither Theodore nor Elena reached the minimum legal age of marriage\u2014fourteen for boys and twelfe for girls\u2014when they were married, but such an early marriage was not unique among Nicaean aristocrats and commoners. She was born to Ivan Asen&nbsp;II and [[Anna Maria of Hungary|Maria of Hungary]] in 1224. The wedding took place at Lampsakos early in 1235. Two years later, before launching an invasion of Nicaean territories in Thrace, her father forced Elena to return to Bulgaria, but peace was restored between the two empires and Elena returned to Theodore before the end of the year. Years later, Theodore described Elena as the flower of his youth and stated that their \"bond of incomparable love\" made them \"happier than all people\". Her sudden death in the spring or summer of 1252 plunged Theodore into grief. She gave birth to four or five daughters, and one son.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=72\u201375}} Their children are the following:\n*[[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]] who married [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria]] was Emperor Michael&nbsp;VIII's implacable enemy until her death around 1270.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=67}}\n*Maria who married [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros I of Epirus]] deceased between early in 1257 and 1265.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=68}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=169}}\n*Theodora was married off by Michael&nbsp;VIII to a [[Morea|Morean]] nobleman, ''Ma\u00efos D\u00e9b\u00e9likourtos'', according to Pachymeres and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].

In 2008 Adjovi allegedly accepted [US]$2.5 million for the 2008 Awards to be hosted by the [[Cross River State|Cross River]] State Government. He later allegedly struck an agreement with the [[Lagos State]] Government for US$7.5 million but the awards were not staged until 2010 in [[Burkina Faso]]. At those awards brothers [[P-Square|PSquare]] were named Artiste of the Year and were awarded a cash prize of $1 million but the prize was not forthcoming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenet.ng/2011/08/kora-awards-chairman-ernest-adjovi-arrested-by-lagos-police/|title=Kora Awards Chairman Ernest Adjovi Arrested By Lagos Police by Osagie Alonge 15 August 2011|website=Net|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 2015 awards were to be held 13 December in [[Namibia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicinafrica.net/kora-awards-return-million-dollar-grand-prize|title=Kora Awards return with million dollar grand prize by In-house team 29 May 2015|website=Music Africa|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref> and a launch event was held in Namibia in May 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/entertainment/2015/05/23/koras-boss-reveals-struggle|title=Koras boss reveals struggle by Patience Bambalele 23 May 2015|website=Sowetan Live|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref> They were postponed to March 2016 and Adjovi was paid N$23,5 million.

This allows them to be snapped into a mounting plate with correspondingly-sized rectangular holes, called ports.

{"title_page": "List of IATA-indexed railway stations", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of IATA-indexed railway stations''', which are assigned codes by the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]], similar to [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport codes]]. Such [[railway stations]] are typically used in [[air-rail alliance]]s or code sharing agreements (commonly known as \"Rail Fly\") between [[airlines]] and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Airports ==\n\nRail lines at airports include:\n\n;Austria\n* [[Vienna International Airport]]\n\n;Belgium\n* [[Brussels Airport]] using [[NMBS/SNCB|Belgian Railways]]\n\n;Denmark\n* [[Copenhagen Airport]], air tickets usable for [[SJ AB|Swedish State Railways]] (not [[DSB (railway company)|Danish State Railways]]).\n\n;France\n* [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] near [[Roissy-en-France|Roissy]], France, with [[SNCF|SNCF French Rail]] and [[Eurostar]].\n* [[Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]], the first airport to be served by a high-speed line.\n\n;Germany\n* [[Frankfurt International Airport]]\n* [[Cologne Bonn Airport]]\n* [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]\n* [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]\n([[AIRail Service]] with [[Deutsche Bahn]]).\n\n;Netherlands\n* [[Schiphol Airport]] near [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands.

Such [[railway stations]] are typically used in [[air-rail alliance]]s or code sharing agreements (commonly known as \"Rail Fly\") between [[airlines]] and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Airports ==\n\nRail lines at airports include:\n\n;Austria\n* [[Vienna International Airport]]\n\n;Belgium\n* [[Brussels Airport]] using [[NMBS/SNCB|Belgian Railways]]\n\n;Denmark\n* [[Copenhagen Airport]], air tickets usable for [[SJ AB|Swedish State Railways]] (not [[DSB (railway company)|Danish State Railways]]).\n\n;France\n* [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] near [[Roissy-en-France|Roissy]], France, with [[SNCF|SNCF French Rail]] and [[Eurostar]].\n* [[Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]], the first airport to be served by a high-speed line.\n\n;Germany\n* [[Frankfurt International Airport]]\n* [[Cologne Bonn Airport]]\n* [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]\n* [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]\n([[AIRail Service]] with [[Deutsche Bahn]]).\n\n;Netherlands\n* [[Schiphol Airport]] near [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands.
