The coup was the culmination of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam. Discontent with the Di\u1ec7m regime had been simmering below the surface, and exploded with mass [[Buddhist crisis|Buddhist protests]] against long-standing religious discrimination after the [[Hu\u1ebf Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u1ea3n shootings|government shooting]] of protesters who defied a ban on the flying of the [[Buddhist flag]].\n\nThe [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) had launched a bloody overnight siege on [[Gia Long Palace]] in [[Saigon]]. When rebel forces entered the palace, Di\u1ec7m and his adviser and younger brother [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu]] were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]]. The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace. The Ng\u00f4 brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an [[armoured personnel carrier]] by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters near [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ee9t Air Base]]. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ng\u00f4 brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Nhung]] and on Major [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng Hi\u1ebfu Ngh\u0129a]], both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ng\u00f4s' corpses surfaced in the media.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Ngo_Dinh_Diem_-_Thumbnail_-_ARC_542189.png|right|thumb|Ngo Dinh Diem|alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile.

At the time, Vietnam had been [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned]] at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] after the defeat of the [[French Union]] forces at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the [[17th parallel north]]. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Di\u1ec7m and B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i were locked in a power struggle. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i disliked Di\u1ec7m but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Di\u1ec7m scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Di\u1ec7m won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 83\u201385</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m refused to hold the reunification elections, on the basis that the State of Vietnam was not a signatory to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and [[Nepotism|nepotistic]] rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Di\u1ec7m the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers.<ref>Jacobs, p. 86.</ref> Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the [[Viet Cong]], which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 111\u2013114.</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m kept the control of the nation firmly within the hands of his brothers and their in-laws and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Di\u1ec7m; in 1960, a [[1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|paratroop revolt]] was quashed after Di\u1ec7m stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 [[1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|palace bombing]] by two [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] pilots failed to kill him.<ref>Jacobs, p. 141</ref> South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Di\u1ec7m's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform.<ref>Jacobs, p. 96</ref> In the countryside, Catholics were ''de facto'' exempt from performing [[corv\u00e9e]] labour.<ref>Jacobs, p. 91</ref> Discontent with Di\u1ec7m and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Di\u1ec7m's army and police on [[Vesak]], the birthday of [[Gautama Buddha]].<ref>Jacobs, pp. 142\u2013145</ref>\n\nIn May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively invoked; the [[Buddhist flag]] was banned from display on Vesak while the [[Vatican flag]] was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop [[Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c]], Di\u1ec7m's elder brother. The Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Di\u1ec7m remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. The key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August, when Nhu's [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] raided and vandalised Buddhist pagodas across the country, arresting thousands of monks and causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 140\u2013153</ref> Numerous coup plans had been explored by the army before, but the plotters intensified their activities with increased confidence  after the [[Kennedy administration|administration]] of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] authorised the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|US embassy]] to explore the possibility of a leadership change.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 157\u2013168</ref>\n\n==Surrender and debate==\n{{see also|1963 South Vietnamese coup}}\nAt 13:30 on 1 November, Generals [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] and [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4n]], respectively the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff, led a coup against Di\u1ec7m. The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers to prevent them from saving Di\u1ec7m. Unknown to Di\u1ec7m, General [[T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh|\u0110\u00ednh]], the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]] that surrounded the Saigon area, had allied himself with the plotters of the coup.<ref>Jones, pp. 409\u201311.</ref> The second of Di\u1ec7m's most trusted loyalist generals was [[Hu\u1ef3nh V\u0103n Cao]], who commanded the [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]] in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were aware of the coup plan, and Nhu responded by planning a counter-coup, which he called [[Operation Bravo]]. This plan involved \u0110\u00ednh and Colonel [[L\u00ea Quang Tung|Tung]], the loyalist commander of the Special Forces, staging a phony rebellion before their forces crushed the \"uprising\" to reaffirm the power of the Ng\u00f4 family. Unaware that \u0110\u00ednh was plotting against him, Nhu allowed \u0110\u00ednh to organise troops as he saw fit, and \u0110\u00ednh transferred the command of the [[7th Division (South Vietnam)|7th Division]] based at [[M\u1ef9 Tho]] from Cao's IV Corps to his own III Corps. This allowed Colonel [[Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u00f3]], \u0110\u00ednh's deputy, to take command of the 7th Division. The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Di\u1ec7m, as he had done during the previous coup attempt in 1960. Minh and \u0110\u00f4n had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at the headquarters of the Joint General Staff (JGS), on the pretext of routine business. Instead, they announced that a coup was underway, with only a few, including Tung, refusing to join. Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender. The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from entering. This left only the [[Presidential Guard (South Vietnam)|Presidential Guard]] to defend Gia Long Palace. The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace, hoping that Di\u1ec7m would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile. Di\u1ec7m refused, vowing to reassert his control. After sunset, the [[5th Division (South Vietnam)|5th Division]] of Colonel [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]], who later became the nation's president, led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak.<ref>Jones, pp. 412\u201315.</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of 2 November, Di\u1ec7m agreed to surrender. The ARVN officers had intended to exile Di\u1ec7m and Nhu, having promised the Ng\u00f4 brothers safe passage out of the country. At 06:00, just before dawn, the officers held a meeting at JGS headquarters to discuss the fate of the Ng\u00f4 brothers. According to [[Lucien Conein]], the US Army officer and [[CIA]] operative who was the American liaison with the coup, most of the officers, including Minh, wanted Di\u1ec7m to have an \"honorable retirement\" from office, followed by exile.<ref name=h297/> Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting, with  having already left to make arrangements for the arrival of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu at JGS headquarters. General [[Nguyen Ngoc Le|L\u00ea]], a former police chief under Di\u1ec7m in the mid-1950s, strongly lobbied for Di\u1ec7m's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and L\u00ea attracted only minority support. One general was reported to have said \"To kill weeds, you must pull them up at the roots\".<ref name=h297>Hammer, p. 297.</ref> Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was in their minds, since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.<ref name=\"j4167\">Jones, pp. 416\u201317.</ref>\n\nMinh and \u0110\u00f4n asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country. Two days earlier, [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam|US Ambassador to South Vietnam]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point. This request put the Kennedy administration in a difficult position, as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup. When Conein telephoned David Smith, the acting chief of the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute delay. The US government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country, unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Di\u1ec7m. The United States did not want Di\u1ec7m and Nhu to form a government in exile and wanted them far away from Vietnam. Assistant Secretary of State [[Roger Hilsman]] had written in August that \"under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power. If the generals decide to exile Di\u1ec7m, he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia.\"<ref name=\"h294\">Hammer, p. 294.</ref> He further went on to anticipate what he termed a \"[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]] in the palace\".<ref name=\"h295\"/>\n\n{{quote|We should encourage the coup group to fight the battle to the end and destroy the palace if necessary to gain victory. Unconditional surrender should be the terms for the Ng\u00f4 family since it will otherwise seek to outmaneuver both the coups forces and the US. If the family is taken alive, the Nhus should be banished to France or any other country willing to receive them. Di\u1ec7m should be treated as the generals wish.<ref name=\"h295\">Hammer, p. 295.</ref>}}\n\nAfter surrendering, Di\u1ec7m called Lodge by telephone for the last time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Di\u1ec7m spoke for the last time around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Di\u1ec7m surrendered. When Di\u1ec7m called, Lodge \"put [him] on hold\" and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Di\u1ec7m and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the [[Philippines]] until the next day.<ref name=w104/> This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Di\u1ec7m to not resist the coup.<ref name=m271>Moyar, p. 271.</ref> Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, \"We just can't get that involved.\"<ref name=w104>Winters, p. 104.</ref> Dunn said, \"I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them.\"<ref name=m272>Moyar, p. 272.</ref> Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, \"What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every [[Colonel Blimp]] in the world would have made use of them.\"<ref name=m272/>\n\nDunn also claimed that Lodge put Di\u1ec7m on hold in order to inform Conein where the Ng\u00f4 brothers were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account.<ref name=w104/> It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Di\u1ec7m and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane would have to go directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup.<ref name=m272/> Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in [[Guam]], and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Di\u1ec7m for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a [[US Senate]] investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: \"One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day.\"<ref name=\"j4167\"/> The historian [[Mark Moyar]] suspected that Lodge could have flown Di\u1ec7m to [[Clark Air Force Base]] in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that \"when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Di\u1ec7m to give up at a time when the outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive.\"<ref name=m272/>\n\n==Intended arrest at Gia Long Palace==\nIn the meantime, Minh left the JGS headquarters and traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard, Captain [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Nhung]]. Minh arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military ceremonial uniform to supervise the arrest of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu.<ref name=\"j418\"/> Minh had also dispatched an [[M113 armored personnel carrier]] and four jeeps to Gia Long Palace to transport an arrested Di\u1ec7m and Nhu back to JGS headquarters for official surrender. While Minh was on the way to supervise the takeover of the palace, Generals \u0110\u00f4n, [[Tr\u1ea7n Thi\u1ec7n Khi\u00eam]] and [[L\u00ea V\u0103n Kim]] prepared the army headquarters for Di\u1ec7m's arrival and a ceremonial handover of power to the [[Military junta|junta]]. Di\u1ec7m's pictures were taken down and his statue was covered up. A large table covered with green felt was brought in with the intention of seating Di\u1ec7m for the handover to Minh and Vice President [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1]], who was to become the civilian Prime Minister. In a nationally televised event witnessed by international media, Di\u1ec7m would \"ask\" the generals that he and his brother be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country, which would be granted. The brothers were then to be held in a secure place at JGS headquarters while awaiting deportation.<ref name=\"j4167\"/>\n\n==Di\u1ec7m's escape==\n[[Image:LBJ nhu.jpg|Di\u1ec7m's brother [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu]] (right), shaking hands with then US Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1961|right|200px|thumb|alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie.]]\nMinh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 on the night of the coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Di\u1ec7m and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant [[Do Tho|\u00d0\u1ed7 Th\u01a1]], Di\u1ec7m's [[aide-de-camp]], who happened to be a nephew of Colonel [[\u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu]], the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and [[Xu\u00e2n Vy]], head of Nhu's [[Republican Youth]].<ref name=\"h293\">Hammer, p. 293.</ref> After the coup, [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] General [[Paul Harkins]], inspected the tunnel and noted that it \"was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing\".<ref name=\"j418\"/> The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif ({{Coord|10.776|N|106.693|E|display=inline}}), the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting [[Land Rover]]. [[Ellen Hammer]] disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege.<ref name=\"h293\"/> Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black [[Citro\u00ebn DS|Citro\u00ebn]] sedan.<ref name=\"k323\">Karnow, p. 323.</ref> After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Di\u1ec7m that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] of General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Di\u1ec7m was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that \"You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you.\" Another story holds that Di\u1ec7m said \"We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?\" Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.<ref name=\"h293\"/>\n\nThe loyalists reached the home of Ma Tuyen in the [[Hoa people|Chinese]] business district of [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]]. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who was reported to be Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the [[opium]] trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the [[Republic of China]], but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders.<ref name=\"j418\">Jones, p. 418.</ref> Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building.<ref name=\"k323\"/> Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu had escaped during the night.<ref name=\"j418\"/>\n\n==Arrest in Cholon==\n[[Image:Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd Cha Tam.jpg|St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, where the Ngo brothers were arrested|right|120px|thumb]]\n[[File:Gia \u0111\u00ecnh \u0111\u00e2ng l\u1ec5.jpg|thumb|120px|left|A pew in the church is marked with a small plaque identifying the spot where President Ngo Dinh Diem was seized after taking refuge here with his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu on 2 November 1963, after fleeing the Presidential Palace.]]\nAfter Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel [[Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ea3o]] was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Th\u1ea3o was told by Khi\u00eam, his superior, to locate Di\u1ec7m and prevent him from being killed.<ref>Hammer, p. 292.</ref> When Th\u1ea3o arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Di\u1ec7m and Nhu overheard him and Th\u01a1 drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier ({{Coord|10.752|N|106.654|E|display=inline}}), which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Th\u01a1 died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Th\u01a1 recorded Di\u1ec7m's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\".<ref name=\"h294\"/> Soon after the early morning [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] was celebrated for [[All Souls' Day]] (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ng\u00f4 brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received [[Communion rite|Communion]].<ref name=\"j428\">Jones, p. 428.</ref>\n\nA few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building.<ref name=\"j429\"/> Lieutenant Th\u01a1, who had earlier urged Di\u1ec7m to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu, along with \u0110\u00ednh and Khi\u00eam, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later \"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\".<ref name=\"h294\"/>\n\n==Convoy to JGS headquarters==\nThe convoy was led by General [[Mai H\u1eefu Xu\u00e2n]] and consisted of Colonels Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Quan and D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u1ecdc L\u1eafm. Quan was the deputy of Minh and L\u1eafm was the Commander of the [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Civil Guard]]. L\u1eafm had joined the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured. Two further officers made up the convoy: Major [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng Hi\u1ebfu Ngh\u0129a]] and Captain Nhung, Minh's bodyguard.<ref>Hammer, pp. 297\u201398.</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m requested that the convoy stop at the palace so that he could gather personal items before being exiled. Xu\u00e2n turned him down, clinically stating that his orders were to take Di\u1ec7m and Nhu directly to JGS headquarters. Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an APC, asking, \"You use such a vehicle to drive the president?\" L\u1eafm assured them that the armour was for their own protection. Xu\u00e2n said that it was selected to protect them from \"extremists\".<ref name=j429/> Xu\u00e2n ordered the brothers' hands be tied behind their backs before shoving them into the carrier. One officer asked to shoot Nhu, but Xu\u00e2n turned him down.<ref name=\"j429\">Jones, p. 429.</ref>\n\n==Assassination==\nAfter the arrest, Nhung and Ngh\u0129a sat with the brothers in the APC, and the [[convoy]] departed for T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh was reported to have gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by \u0110\u00f4n determined that Ngh\u0129a had shot the brothers at [[point-blank range]] with a [[semi-automatic firearm]] and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.<ref>Karnow, p. 326.</ref>\n\nNgh\u0129a gave his account of what occurred during the journey back to the military headquarters: \"As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Di\u1ec7m sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don't know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.\" Ngh\u0129a said that when the convoy reached a train crossing, \"[Nhung] lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Di\u1ec7m, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Di\u1ec7m nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.\"<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\n==Attempted cover-up==\nWhen the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters, the generals were shocked. Although they despised and had no sympathy for Nhu, they still respected Di\u1ec7m. One general broke down and wept while Minh's assistant, Colonel Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Quan collapsed on a table. General \u0110\u00ednh later declared, \"I couldn't sleep that night\". \u0110\u00f4n maintained that the generals were \"truly grievous\" over the deaths, maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give Di\u1ec7m a safe exile.<ref name=\"j429\"/> \u0110\u00f4n charged Nhu with convincing Di\u1ec7m to reject the offer. Lodge later concluded, \"Once again, brother Nhu proves to be the evil genius in Di\u1ec7m's life.\"<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\n===ARVN reaction===\n\u0110\u00f4n ordered another general to tell reporters that the Ng\u00f4 brothers had died in an accident. He went to confront Minh in his office.<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\n*\u0110\u00f4n: Why are they dead?\n*Minh: And what does it matter that they are dead?<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\nAt this time, Xu\u00e2n walked into Minh's office through the open door, unaware of \u0110\u00f4n's presence. Xu\u00e2n snapped [[At attention|to attention]] and stated, \"''Mission accomplished.''\"<ref name=\"j429\"/> Shortly after midnight on 2 November 1963 in Washington, D.C. the CIA sent word to the White House that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were dead, allegedly by suicide. Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison, and that they had committed suicide while prisoners in an APC transporting them to T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ee9t. Unclear and contradictory stories abounded. General Harkins reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard. Minh tried to explain the discrepancy, saying \"Due to an inadvertence, there was a gun inside the vehicle. It was with this gun that they committed suicide.\"<ref name=\"j425\">Jones, p. 425.</ref>\n\n===US reaction===\n[[Image:Lucien Conein.JPG|right|130px|thumb|[[Lucien Conein]], the CIA's contact with the ARVN generals]]\nKennedy learned of the deaths on the following morning when National Security Council staffer [[Michael Forrestal]] rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ng\u00f4 brothers' alleged suicides. According to General [[Maxwell Taylor]], \"Kennedy leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before.\" Kennedy had planned that Di\u1ec7m would be safely exiled and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] recalled that the US President was \"somber and shaken\". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was \"particularly abhorrent\" and blaming himself for approving [[Cable 243]], which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas.<ref name=\"j425\"/> Forrestal said that \"It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam.\"<ref name=m276>Moyar, p. 276.</ref> When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ng\u00f4 brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied \"No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country.\"<ref name=m276/>\n\nKennedy's reaction did not draw sympathy from his entire administration. Some believed that he should not have supported the coup and that as coups were uncontrollable, assassination was always a possibility. Kennedy was skeptical about the story and suspected that a double assassination had taken place. He reasoned the devoutly Catholic Ng\u00f4 brothers would not have taken their own lives, but Roger Hilsman rationalised the possibility of suicide by asserting that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu would have interpreted the coup as [[Armageddon]].<ref>Jones, p. 427.</ref> US officials soon became aware of the true reasons for the deaths of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu. Lucien Conein had left the rebel headquarters as the generals were preparing to bring in the Ng\u00f4 brothers for the press conference which announced the handover of power. Upon returning to his residence, Conein received a phone call from Saigon's CIA station that ordered him to report to the embassy. The embassy informed Conein that Kennedy had instructed him to find Di\u1ec7m. Conein returned to T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ee9t at around 10:30. The following conversation was reported:<ref name=\"j430\"/>\n*Conein: Where were Diem and Nhu?\n*Minh: They committed suicide. They were in the Catholic Church at Cholon, and they committed suicide.\n*C: Look, you're a Buddhist, I'm a Catholic. If they committed suicide at that church and the priest holds mass tonight, that story won't hold water. Where are they?\n*M: Their bodies are behind General Staff Headquarters. Do you want to see them?\n*C: No.\n*M: Why not?\n*C: Well, if by chance one of a million of the people believe you that they committed suicide in church and I see that they have not committed suicide and I know differently, then if it ever leaks out, I am in trouble.<ref name=\"j430\"/>\n\nConein knew that if he saw the execution wounds, he would not be able to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington.<ref name=\"j430\">Jones, p. 430.</ref> The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' read \"'Suicide' with no hands.\"<ref>Jones, pp. 430\u201331.</ref>\n\n==Media reaction==\nAfter the deaths, the military junta asserted that the Ng\u00f4 brothers had committed suicide. On 6 November, Information Minister Tr\u1ea7n T\u1ef1 Oai declared at a news conference that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu had died through \"accidental suicide\" after a firearm discharged when Nhu had tried to seize it from the arresting officer.<ref name=\"j430\"/> This drew immediate skepticism from [[David Halberstam]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his Vietnam reporting. Halberstam wrote to the [[US Department of State]] that \"extremely reliable private military sources\" had confirmed that the brothers were ordered to be executed upon their return to military headquarters. [[Neil Sheehan]] of [[UPI]] reported a similar account based on what he described as \"highly reliable sources\". Father Leger of Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church asserted that the Ng\u00f4 brothers were kneeling inside the building when soldiers burst in, took them outside and into the APC. Lodge had been informed by \"an unimpeachable source\" that both brothers were shot in the nape of the neck and that Di\u1ec7m's body bore the signs of a beating.<ref name=\"j430\"/>\n\n==Impact and aftermath==\nOnce the news of the cause of death of the Ngo brothers began to become public, the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup. [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings.<ref name=j436/> Lodge cabled back, initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals, saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left on the floor of the vehicle.<ref>Winters, p. 107.</ref> Rusk was worried about the public relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating \u0110\u00f4n on the \"masterful performance\" of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. \u0110\u00f4n's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that \"I am sure assassination was not at their direction.\" Minh and \u0110\u00f4n reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings. The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs [[W. Averell Harriman]] declared that \"it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed.\" He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him. Embassy official Rufus Phillips, who was the US adviser to Nhu's [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], said that \"I wanted to sit down and cry\",<ref name=\"j436\"/> citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam.<ref name=\"j436\">Jones, p. 436.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Howard Jones, the fact \"that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused.\"<ref name=\"j436\"/> The assassinations caused a split within the coup leadership, turning the initial harmony among the generals into discord, and further abroad repulsed American and world opinion, exploding the myth that this new regime would constitute a distinct improvement over their predecessors, and ultimately convinced Washington that even though the leaders' names had changed in Saigon, the situation remained the same.<ref name=\"j436\"/> The criticism of the killings further caused the officers to distrust and battle one another for positions in the new government. \u0110\u00f4n expressed his abhorrence at the assassinations by caustically remarking that he had organised the armoured car in an effort to protect Di\u1ec7m and Nhu. Khanh claimed that the only condition he had put on joining the conspiracy was that Diem would not be killed. According to Jones, \"when decisions regarding postcoup affairs took priority, resentment over the killings meshed with the visceral competition over government posts to disassemble the new regime before it fully took form.\"<ref name=\"j436\"/>\n\n==Culpability debate==\n[[Image:Nguyen Van Thieu with map (cropped).jpg|Thi\u1ec7u (pictured) and Minh blamed one another for the assassinations.|right|220px|thumb|alt=Middle-aged black-haired man, stands side-on in a dark suit with a cigarette in right hand and left hand in pocket, looking at the large map of the Asia Pacific region on the wall.]]\nThe responsibility for the assassinations was generally placed on Minh. Conein asserted that \"I have it on very good authority of very many people, that Big Minh gave the order\", as did [[William Colby]], the director of the CIA's Far Eastern division. \u0110\u00f4n was equally emphatic, saying \"I can state without equivocation that this was done by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh and by him alone.\"<ref name=\"j435\">Jones, p. 435.</ref> Lodge thought that Xu\u00e2n was also partly culpable asserting that \"Di\u1ec7m and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xu\u00e2n personally, at least at his direction.\"<ref name=\"j436\"/>\n\nMinh placed the blame on Thi\u1ec7u, after the latter became President, for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed that Thi\u1ec7u was responsible for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace. \u0110\u00f4n was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night, asking him on the phone \"Why are you so slow in doing it? Do you need more troops? If you do, ask \u0110\u00ednh to send more troops&nbsp;\u2013 and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general.\"<ref>Hammer, p. 299.</ref> Thi\u1ec7u stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement which Minh did not publicly rebut: \"D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m.\"<ref name=\"j435\"/>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]], a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost to him in the 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under [[E. Howard Hunt]] into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.<ref>Hammer, p. 296.</ref>\n\n==Motivation==\nConein asserted that Minh's humiliation by Di\u1ec7m and Nhu was a major motivation for ordering their executions. Conein reasoned that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were doomed once they escaped from Gia Long Palace, instead of surrendering there and accepting the offer of safe exile. Having successfully stormed the palace, Minh had presumed that the brothers would be inside, and arrived at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform \"with a sedan and everything else.\" Conein described Minh as a \"very proud man\" who had lost face at turning up at the palace for his moment of glory, only to find an empty building. More than a decade after the coup, Conein claimed Di\u1ec7m and Nhu would not have been killed if they had been in the palace, because there were too many people present.<ref name=\"j435\"/>\n\nOne Vietnamese Di\u1ec7m loyalist asked friends in the CIA why an assassination had taken place, reasoning that if Diem was deemed to be inefficient, his deposal would suffice. The CIA employees responded that \"They had to kill him. Otherwise his supporters would gradually  rally and organise and there would be civil war.\" Some months after the event, Minh was reported to have privately told an American that \"We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Di\u1ec7m could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared&nbsp;\u2013 and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power.\"<ref name=\"j435\"/>\n\n[[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]], a civilian opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the [[Caravelle Manifesto]] that criticised Di\u1ec7m, and later briefly served as Prime Minister, gave a scathing analysis of the generals' action. He stated that \"The top generals who decided to murder Di\u1ec7m and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew very well that having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive.\"<ref>Jones, pp. 435\u201336.</ref>\n\n==Burials of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu==\nAt around 16:00 on 2 November, the bodies of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were identified by the wife of former Cabinet minister Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u00f9ng Dung.<ref>Buttinger, p. 1008.</ref> The corpses were taken to St. Paul's Catholic Hospital, where a French doctor made a formal statement of death without conducting an autopsy. The original death certificate did not describe Di\u1ec7m as Head of State but as \"Chief of Province\", a post he had held four decades earlier under the French colonial administration. Nhu was described as \"Chief of Library Service\", a post which he held in the 1940s.<ref name=s210/> This was interpreted as a Vietnamese way of expressing contempt for the two despised leaders. Their place of burial was never disclosed by the junta and rumours regarding it persist to the current day. The speculated burial places include a military prison, a local cemetery, the grounds of the JGS headquarters and there are reports of cremation as well.<ref name=s210>Shaplen, p. 210.</ref><ref>Jacobs, p. 189.</ref> Nobody was ever prosecuted for the killings.<ref>Jones, p. 180.</ref>\n\n==Memorial services==\nThe government did not approve a public memorial service for the deaths of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu until 1968. In 1971, several thousand mourners gathered at Di\u1ec7m's purported gravesite. Catholic prayers were given in [[Latin]]. Banners proclaimed Di\u1ec7m as a saviour of the south, with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Di\u1ec7m. Madame Thi\u1ec7u, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon's basilica. Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN. According to the eulogy, Di\u1ec7m died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country.<ref>Hammer, p. 317.</ref> Thi\u1ec7u sponsored the services, and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Di\u1ec7m's personal characteristics. Di\u1ec7m frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity, in contrast to Thi\u1ec7u, who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans. However, Thi\u1ec7u's attempts to associate himself with Di\u1ec7m's relative independence from United States influence was not successful.<ref>Lipsman and Weiss, pp. 156\u201357.</ref> According to General Maxwell Taylor, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, ''\"there was the memory of Di\u1ec7m to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall. By our complicity, we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves\"''.<ref>Hammer, p. 315.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Vietnam|Politics|1960s}}\n*{{cite book|title=Vietnam: A Dragon Embattled|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamdragonemb02butt|url-access=registration|authorlink=Joseph Buttinger|first=Joseph|last=Buttinger|year=1967|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York City, New York}}\n*{{cite book|title=A Death in November: America in Vietnam, 1963| authorlink=Ellen Hammer|first=Ellen J.|last=Hammer|year=1987|publisher=[[E.

The coup was the culmination of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam. Discontent with the Di\u1ec7m regime had been simmering below the surface, and exploded with mass [[Buddhist crisis|Buddhist protests]] against long-standing religious discrimination after the [[Hu\u1ebf Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u1ea3n shootings|government shooting]] of protesters who defied a ban on the flying of the [[Buddhist flag]].\n\nThe [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) had launched a bloody overnight siege on [[Gia Long Palace]] in [[Saigon]]. When rebel forces entered the palace, Di\u1ec7m and his adviser and younger brother [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu]] were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]]. The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace. The Ng\u00f4 brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an [[armoured personnel carrier]] by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters near [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ee9t Air Base]]. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ng\u00f4 brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Nhung]] and on Major [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng Hi\u1ebfu Ngh\u0129a]], both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ng\u00f4s' corpses surfaced in the media.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Ngo_Dinh_Diem_-_Thumbnail_-_ARC_542189.png|right|thumb|Ngo Dinh Diem|alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile.

At the time, Vietnam had been [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned]] at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] after the defeat of the [[French Union]] forces at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the [[17th parallel north]]. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Di\u1ec7m and B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i were locked in a power struggle. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i disliked Di\u1ec7m but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Di\u1ec7m scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Di\u1ec7m won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 83\u201385</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m refused to hold the reunification elections, on the basis that the State of Vietnam was not a signatory to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and [[Nepotism|nepotistic]] rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Di\u1ec7m the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers.<ref>Jacobs, p. 86.</ref> Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the [[Viet Cong]], which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 111\u2013114.</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m kept the control of the nation firmly within the hands of his brothers and their in-laws and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Di\u1ec7m; in 1960, a [[1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|paratroop revolt]] was quashed after Di\u1ec7m stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 [[1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|palace bombing]] by two [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] pilots failed to kill him.<ref>Jacobs, p. 141</ref> South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Di\u1ec7m's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform.<ref>Jacobs, p. 96</ref> In the countryside, Catholics were ''de facto'' exempt from performing [[corv\u00e9e]] labour.<ref>Jacobs, p. 91</ref> Discontent with Di\u1ec7m and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Di\u1ec7m's army and police on [[Vesak]], the birthday of [[Gautama Buddha]].<ref>Jacobs, pp. 142\u2013145</ref>\n\nIn May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively invoked; the [[Buddhist flag]] was banned from display on Vesak while the [[Vatican flag]] was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop [[Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c]], Di\u1ec7m's elder brother. The Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Di\u1ec7m remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. The key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August, when Nhu's [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] raided and vandalised Buddhist pagodas across the country, arresting thousands of monks and causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 140\u2013153</ref> Numerous coup plans had been explored by the army before, but the plotters intensified their activities with increased confidence  after the [[Kennedy administration|administration]] of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] authorised the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|US embassy]] to explore the possibility of a leadership change.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 157\u2013168</ref>\n\n==Surrender and debate==\n{{see also|1963 South Vietnamese coup}}\nAt 13:30 on 1 November, Generals [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] and [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4n]], respectively the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff, led a coup against Di\u1ec7m. The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers to prevent them from saving Di\u1ec7m. Unknown to Di\u1ec7m, General [[T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh|\u0110\u00ednh]], the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]] that surrounded the Saigon area, had allied himself with the plotters of the coup.<ref>Jones, pp. 409\u201311.</ref> The second of Di\u1ec7m's most trusted loyalist generals was [[Hu\u1ef3nh V\u0103n Cao]], who commanded the [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]] in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were aware of the coup plan, and Nhu responded by planning a counter-coup, which he called [[Operation Bravo]]. This plan involved \u0110\u00ednh and Colonel [[L\u00ea Quang Tung|Tung]], the loyalist commander of the Special Forces, staging a phony rebellion before their forces crushed the \"uprising\" to reaffirm the power of the Ng\u00f4 family. Unaware that \u0110\u00ednh was plotting against him, Nhu allowed \u0110\u00ednh to organise troops as he saw fit, and \u0110\u00ednh transferred the command of the [[7th Division (South Vietnam)|7th Division]] based at [[M\u1ef9 Tho]] from Cao's IV Corps to his own III Corps. This allowed Colonel [[Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u00f3]], \u0110\u00ednh's deputy, to take command of the 7th Division. The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Di\u1ec7m, as he had done during the previous coup attempt in 1960. Minh and \u0110\u00f4n had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at the headquarters of the Joint General Staff (JGS), on the pretext of routine business. Instead, they announced that a coup was underway, with only a few, including Tung, refusing to join. Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender. The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from entering. This left only the [[Presidential Guard (South Vietnam)|Presidential Guard]] to defend Gia Long Palace. The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace, hoping that Di\u1ec7m would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile. Di\u1ec7m refused, vowing to reassert his control. After sunset, the [[5th Division (South Vietnam)|5th Division]] of Colonel [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]], who later became the nation's president, led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak.<ref>Jones, pp. 412\u201315.</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of 2 November, Di\u1ec7m agreed to surrender. The ARVN officers had intended to exile Di\u1ec7m and Nhu, having promised the Ng\u00f4 brothers safe passage out of the country. At 06:00, just before dawn, the officers held a meeting at JGS headquarters to discuss the fate of the Ng\u00f4 brothers. According to [[Lucien Conein]], the US Army officer and [[CIA]] operative who was the American liaison with the coup, most of the officers, including Minh, wanted Di\u1ec7m to have an \"honorable retirement\" from office, followed by exile.<ref name=h297/> Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting, with  having already left to make arrangements for the arrival of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu at JGS headquarters. General [[Nguyen Ngoc Le|L\u00ea]], a former police chief under Di\u1ec7m in the mid-1950s, strongly lobbied for Di\u1ec7m's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and L\u00ea attracted only minority support. One general was reported to have said \"To kill weeds, you must pull them up at the roots\".<ref name=h297>Hammer, p. 297.</ref> Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was in their minds, since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.<ref name=\"j4167\">Jones, pp. 416\u201317.</ref>\n\nMinh and \u0110\u00f4n asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country. Two days earlier, [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam|US Ambassador to South Vietnam]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point. This request put the Kennedy administration in a difficult position, as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup. When Conein telephoned David Smith, the acting chief of the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute delay. The US government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country, unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Di\u1ec7m. The United States did not want Di\u1ec7m and Nhu to form a government in exile and wanted them far away from Vietnam. Assistant Secretary of State [[Roger Hilsman]] had written in August that \"under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power. If the generals decide to exile Di\u1ec7m, he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia.\"<ref name=\"h294\">Hammer, p. 294.</ref> He further went on to anticipate what he termed a \"[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]] in the palace\".<ref name=\"h295\"/>\n\n{{quote|We should encourage the coup group to fight the battle to the end and destroy the palace if necessary to gain victory. Unconditional surrender should be the terms for the Ng\u00f4 family since it will otherwise seek to outmaneuver both the coups forces and the US. If the family is taken alive, the Nhus should be banished to France or any other country willing to receive them. Di\u1ec7m should be treated as the generals wish.<ref name=\"h295\">Hammer, p. 295.</ref>}}\n\nAfter surrendering, Di\u1ec7m called Lodge by telephone for the last time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Di\u1ec7m spoke for the last time around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Di\u1ec7m surrendered. When Di\u1ec7m called, Lodge \"put [him] on hold\" and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Di\u1ec7m and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the [[Philippines]] until the next day.<ref name=w104/> This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Di\u1ec7m to not resist the coup.<ref name=m271>Moyar, p. 271.</ref> Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, \"We just can't get that involved.\"<ref name=w104>Winters, p. 104.</ref> Dunn said, \"I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them.\"<ref name=m272>Moyar, p. 272.</ref> Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, \"What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every [[Colonel Blimp]] in the world would have made use of them.\"<ref name=m272/>\n\nDunn also claimed that Lodge put Di\u1ec7m on hold in order to inform Conein where the Ng\u00f4 brothers were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account.<ref name=w104/> It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Di\u1ec7m and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane would have to go directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup.<ref name=m272/> Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in [[Guam]], and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Di\u1ec7m for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a [[US Senate]] investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: \"One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day.\"<ref name=\"j4167\"/> The historian [[Mark Moyar]] suspected that Lodge could have flown Di\u1ec7m to [[Clark Air Force Base]] in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that \"when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Di\u1ec7m to give up at a time when the outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive.\"<ref name=m272/>\n\n==Intended arrest at Gia Long Palace==\nIn the meantime, Minh left the JGS headquarters and traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard, Captain [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Nhung]]. Minh arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military ceremonial uniform to supervise the arrest of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu.<ref name=\"j418\"/> Minh had also dispatched an [[M113 armored personnel carrier]] and four jeeps to Gia Long Palace to transport an arrested Di\u1ec7m and Nhu back to JGS headquarters for official surrender. While Minh was on the way to supervise the takeover of the palace, Generals \u0110\u00f4n, [[Tr\u1ea7n Thi\u1ec7n Khi\u00eam]] and [[L\u00ea V\u0103n Kim]] prepared the army headquarters for Di\u1ec7m's arrival and a ceremonial handover of power to the [[Military junta|junta]]. Di\u1ec7m's pictures were taken down and his statue was covered up. A large table covered with green felt was brought in with the intention of seating Di\u1ec7m for the handover to Minh and Vice President [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Th\u01a1]], who was to become the civilian Prime Minister. In a nationally televised event witnessed by international media, Di\u1ec7m would \"ask\" the generals that he and his brother be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country, which would be granted. The brothers were then to be held in a secure place at JGS headquarters while awaiting deportation.<ref name=\"j4167\"/>\n\n==Di\u1ec7m's escape==\n[[Image:LBJ nhu.jpg|Di\u1ec7m's brother [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu]] (right), shaking hands with then US Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1961|right|200px|thumb|alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie.]]\nMinh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 on the night of the coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Di\u1ec7m and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant [[Do Tho|\u00d0\u1ed7 Th\u01a1]], Di\u1ec7m's [[aide-de-camp]], who happened to be a nephew of Colonel [[\u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu]], the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and [[Xu\u00e2n Vy]], head of Nhu's [[Republican Youth]].<ref name=\"h293\">Hammer, p. 293.</ref> After the coup, [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] General [[Paul Harkins]], inspected the tunnel and noted that it \"was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing\".<ref name=\"j418\"/> The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif ({{Coord|10.776|N|106.693|E|display=inline}}), the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting [[Land Rover]]. [[Ellen Hammer]] disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege.<ref name=\"h293\"/> Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black [[Citro\u00ebn DS|Citro\u00ebn]] sedan.<ref name=\"k323\">Karnow, p. 323.</ref> After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Di\u1ec7m that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] of General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Di\u1ec7m was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that \"You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you.\" Another story holds that Di\u1ec7m said \"We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?\" Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.<ref name=\"h293\"/>\n\nThe loyalists reached the home of Ma Tuyen in the [[Hoa people|Chinese]] business district of [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]]. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who was reported to be Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the [[opium]] trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the [[Republic of China]], but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders.<ref name=\"j418\">Jones, p. 418.</ref> Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building.<ref name=\"k323\"/> Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu had escaped during the night.<ref name=\"j418\"/>\n\n==Arrest in Cholon==\n[[Image:Nh\u00e0 th\u1edd Cha Tam.jpg|St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, where the Ngo brothers were arrested|right|120px|thumb]]\n[[File:Gia \u0111\u00ecnh \u0111\u00e2ng l\u1ec5.jpg|thumb|120px|left|A pew in the church is marked with a small plaque identifying the spot where President Ngo Dinh Diem was seized after taking refuge here with his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu on 2 November 1963, after fleeing the Presidential Palace.]]\nAfter Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel [[Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ea3o]] was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Th\u1ea3o was told by Khi\u00eam, his superior, to locate Di\u1ec7m and prevent him from being killed.<ref>Hammer, p. 292.</ref> When Th\u1ea3o arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Di\u1ec7m and Nhu overheard him and Th\u01a1 drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier ({{Coord|10.752|N|106.654|E|display=inline}}), which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Th\u01a1 died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Th\u01a1 recorded Di\u1ec7m's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\".<ref name=\"h294\"/> Soon after the early morning [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] was celebrated for [[All Souls' Day]] (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ng\u00f4 brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received [[Communion rite|Communion]].<ref name=\"j428\">Jones, p. 428.</ref>\n\nA few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building.<ref name=\"j429\"/> Lieutenant Th\u01a1, who had earlier urged Di\u1ec7m to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu, along with \u0110\u00ednh and Khi\u00eam, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later \"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\".<ref name=\"h294\"/>\n\n==Convoy to JGS headquarters==\nThe convoy was led by General [[Mai H\u1eefu Xu\u00e2n]] and consisted of Colonels Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Quan and D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u1ecdc L\u1eafm. Quan was the deputy of Minh and L\u1eafm was the Commander of the [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Civil Guard]]. L\u1eafm had joined the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured. Two further officers made up the convoy: Major [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng Hi\u1ebfu Ngh\u0129a]] and Captain Nhung, Minh's bodyguard.<ref>Hammer, pp. 297\u201398.</ref>\n\nDi\u1ec7m requested that the convoy stop at the palace so that he could gather personal items before being exiled. Xu\u00e2n turned him down, clinically stating that his orders were to take Di\u1ec7m and Nhu directly to JGS headquarters. Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an APC, asking, \"You use such a vehicle to drive the president?\" L\u1eafm assured them that the armour was for their own protection. Xu\u00e2n said that it was selected to protect them from \"extremists\".<ref name=j429/> Xu\u00e2n ordered the brothers' hands be tied behind their backs before shoving them into the carrier. One officer asked to shoot Nhu, but Xu\u00e2n turned him down.<ref name=\"j429\">Jones, p. 429.</ref>\n\n==Assassination==\nAfter the arrest, Nhung and Ngh\u0129a sat with the brothers in the APC, and the [[convoy]] departed for T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh was reported to have gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by \u0110\u00f4n determined that Ngh\u0129a had shot the brothers at [[point-blank range]] with a [[semi-automatic firearm]] and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.<ref>Karnow, p. 326.</ref>\n\nNgh\u0129a gave his account of what occurred during the journey back to the military headquarters: \"As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Di\u1ec7m sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don't know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.\" Ngh\u0129a said that when the convoy reached a train crossing, \"[Nhung] lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Di\u1ec7m, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Di\u1ec7m nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.\"<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\n==Attempted cover-up==\nWhen the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters, the generals were shocked. Although they despised and had no sympathy for Nhu, they still respected Di\u1ec7m. One general broke down and wept while Minh's assistant, Colonel Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Quan collapsed on a table. General \u0110\u00ednh later declared, \"I couldn't sleep that night\". \u0110\u00f4n maintained that the generals were \"truly grievous\" over the deaths, maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give Di\u1ec7m a safe exile.<ref name=\"j429\"/> \u0110\u00f4n charged Nhu with convincing Di\u1ec7m to reject the offer. Lodge later concluded, \"Once again, brother Nhu proves to be the evil genius in Di\u1ec7m's life.\"<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\n===ARVN reaction===\n\u0110\u00f4n ordered another general to tell reporters that the Ng\u00f4 brothers had died in an accident. He went to confront Minh in his office.<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\n*\u0110\u00f4n: Why are they dead?\n*Minh: And what does it matter that they are dead?<ref name=\"j429\"/>\n\nAt this time, Xu\u00e2n walked into Minh's office through the open door, unaware of \u0110\u00f4n's presence. Xu\u00e2n snapped [[At attention|to attention]] and stated, \"''Mission accomplished.''\"<ref name=\"j429\"/> Shortly after midnight on 2 November 1963 in Washington, D.C. the CIA sent word to the White House that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were dead, allegedly by suicide. Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison, and that they had committed suicide while prisoners in an APC transporting them to T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ee9t. Unclear and contradictory stories abounded. General Harkins reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard. Minh tried to explain the discrepancy, saying \"Due to an inadvertence, there was a gun inside the vehicle. It was with this gun that they committed suicide.\"<ref name=\"j425\">Jones, p. 425.</ref>\n\n===US reaction===\n[[Image:Lucien Conein.JPG|right|130px|thumb|[[Lucien Conein]], the CIA's contact with the ARVN generals]]\nKennedy learned of the deaths on the following morning when National Security Council staffer [[Michael Forrestal]] rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ng\u00f4 brothers' alleged suicides. According to General [[Maxwell Taylor]], \"Kennedy leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before.\" Kennedy had planned that Di\u1ec7m would be safely exiled and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] recalled that the US President was \"somber and shaken\". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was \"particularly abhorrent\" and blaming himself for approving [[Cable 243]], which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas.<ref name=\"j425\"/> Forrestal said that \"It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam.\"<ref name=m276>Moyar, p. 276.</ref> When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ng\u00f4 brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied \"No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country.\"<ref name=m276/>\n\nKennedy's reaction did not draw sympathy from his entire administration. Some believed that he should not have supported the coup and that as coups were uncontrollable, assassination was always a possibility. Kennedy was skeptical about the story and suspected that a double assassination had taken place. He reasoned the devoutly Catholic Ng\u00f4 brothers would not have taken their own lives, but Roger Hilsman rationalised the possibility of suicide by asserting that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu would have interpreted the coup as [[Armageddon]].<ref>Jones, p. 427.</ref> US officials soon became aware of the true reasons for the deaths of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu. Lucien Conein had left the rebel headquarters as the generals were preparing to bring in the Ng\u00f4 brothers for the press conference which announced the handover of power. Upon returning to his residence, Conein received a phone call from Saigon's CIA station that ordered him to report to the embassy. The embassy informed Conein that Kennedy had instructed him to find Di\u1ec7m. Conein returned to T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ee9t at around 10:30. The following conversation was reported:<ref name=\"j430\"/>\n*Conein: Where were Diem and Nhu?\n*Minh: They committed suicide. They were in the Catholic Church at Cholon, and they committed suicide.\n*C: Look, you're a Buddhist, I'm a Catholic. If they committed suicide at that church and the priest holds mass tonight, that story won't hold water. Where are they?\n*M: Their bodies are behind General Staff Headquarters. Do you want to see them?\n*C: No.\n*M: Why not?\n*C: Well, if by chance one of a million of the people believe you that they committed suicide in church and I see that they have not committed suicide and I know differently, then if it ever leaks out, I am in trouble.<ref name=\"j430\"/>\n\nConein knew that if he saw the execution wounds, he would not be able to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington.<ref name=\"j430\">Jones, p. 430.</ref> The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' read \"'Suicide' with no hands.\"<ref>Jones, pp. 430\u201331.</ref>\n\n==Media reaction==\nAfter the deaths, the military junta asserted that the Ng\u00f4 brothers had committed suicide. On 6 November, Information Minister Tr\u1ea7n T\u1ef1 Oai declared at a news conference that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu had died through \"accidental suicide\" after a firearm discharged when Nhu had tried to seize it from the arresting officer.<ref name=\"j430\"/> This drew immediate skepticism from [[David Halberstam]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his Vietnam reporting. Halberstam wrote to the [[US Department of State]] that \"extremely reliable private military sources\" had confirmed that the brothers were ordered to be executed upon their return to military headquarters. [[Neil Sheehan]] of [[UPI]] reported a similar account based on what he described as \"highly reliable sources\". Father Leger of Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church asserted that the Ng\u00f4 brothers were kneeling inside the building when soldiers burst in, took them outside and into the APC. Lodge had been informed by \"an unimpeachable source\" that both brothers were shot in the nape of the neck and that Di\u1ec7m's body bore the signs of a beating.<ref name=\"j430\"/>\n\n==Impact and aftermath==\nOnce the news of the cause of death of the Ngo brothers began to become public, the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup. [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings.<ref name=j436/> Lodge cabled back, initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals, saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left on the floor of the vehicle.<ref>Winters, p. 107.</ref> Rusk was worried about the public relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating \u0110\u00f4n on the \"masterful performance\" of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. \u0110\u00f4n's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that \"I am sure assassination was not at their direction.\" Minh and \u0110\u00f4n reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings. The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs [[W. Averell Harriman]] declared that \"it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed.\" He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him. Embassy official Rufus Phillips, who was the US adviser to Nhu's [[Strategic Hamlet Program]], said that \"I wanted to sit down and cry\",<ref name=\"j436\"/> citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam.<ref name=\"j436\">Jones, p. 436.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Howard Jones, the fact \"that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused.\"<ref name=\"j436\"/> The assassinations caused a split within the coup leadership, turning the initial harmony among the generals into discord, and further abroad repulsed American and world opinion, exploding the myth that this new regime would constitute a distinct improvement over their predecessors, and ultimately convinced Washington that even though the leaders' names had changed in Saigon, the situation remained the same.<ref name=\"j436\"/> The criticism of the killings further caused the officers to distrust and battle one another for positions in the new government. \u0110\u00f4n expressed his abhorrence at the assassinations by caustically remarking that he had organised the armoured car in an effort to protect Di\u1ec7m and Nhu. Khanh claimed that the only condition he had put on joining the conspiracy was that Diem would not be killed. According to Jones, \"when decisions regarding postcoup affairs took priority, resentment over the killings meshed with the visceral competition over government posts to disassemble the new regime before it fully took form.\"<ref name=\"j436\"/>\n\n==Culpability debate==\n[[Image:Nguyen Van Thieu with map (cropped).jpg|Thi\u1ec7u (pictured) and Minh blamed one another for the assassinations.|right|220px|thumb|alt=Middle-aged black-haired man, stands side-on in a dark suit with a cigarette in right hand and left hand in pocket, looking at the large map of the Asia Pacific region on the wall.]]\nThe responsibility for the assassinations was generally placed on Minh. Conein asserted that \"I have it on very good authority of very many people, that Big Minh gave the order\", as did [[William Colby]], the director of the CIA's Far Eastern division. \u0110\u00f4n was equally emphatic, saying \"I can state without equivocation that this was done by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh and by him alone.\"<ref name=\"j435\">Jones, p. 435.</ref> Lodge thought that Xu\u00e2n was also partly culpable asserting that \"Di\u1ec7m and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xu\u00e2n personally, at least at his direction.\"<ref name=\"j436\"/>\n\nMinh placed the blame on Thi\u1ec7u, after the latter became President, for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed that Thi\u1ec7u was responsible for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace. \u0110\u00f4n was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night, asking him on the phone \"Why are you so slow in doing it? Do you need more troops? If you do, ask \u0110\u00ednh to send more troops&nbsp;\u2013 and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general.\"<ref>Hammer, p. 299.</ref> Thi\u1ec7u stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement which Minh did not publicly rebut: \"D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m.\"<ref name=\"j435\"/>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]], a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost to him in the 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under [[E. Howard Hunt]] into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.<ref>Hammer, p. 296.</ref>\n\n==Motivation==\nConein asserted that Minh's humiliation by Di\u1ec7m and Nhu was a major motivation for ordering their executions. Conein reasoned that Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were doomed once they escaped from Gia Long Palace, instead of surrendering there and accepting the offer of safe exile. Having successfully stormed the palace, Minh had presumed that the brothers would be inside, and arrived at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform \"with a sedan and everything else.\" Conein described Minh as a \"very proud man\" who had lost face at turning up at the palace for his moment of glory, only to find an empty building. More than a decade after the coup, Conein claimed Di\u1ec7m and Nhu would not have been killed if they had been in the palace, because there were too many people present.<ref name=\"j435\"/>\n\nOne Vietnamese Di\u1ec7m loyalist asked friends in the CIA why an assassination had taken place, reasoning that if Diem was deemed to be inefficient, his deposal would suffice. The CIA employees responded that \"They had to kill him. Otherwise his supporters would gradually  rally and organise and there would be civil war.\" Some months after the event, Minh was reported to have privately told an American that \"We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Di\u1ec7m could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared&nbsp;\u2013 and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power.\"<ref name=\"j435\"/>\n\n[[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]], a civilian opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the [[Caravelle Manifesto]] that criticised Di\u1ec7m, and later briefly served as Prime Minister, gave a scathing analysis of the generals' action. He stated that \"The top generals who decided to murder Di\u1ec7m and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew very well that having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive.\"<ref>Jones, pp. 435\u201336.</ref>\n\n==Burials of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu==\nAt around 16:00 on 2 November, the bodies of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were identified by the wife of former Cabinet minister Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u00f9ng Dung.<ref>Buttinger, p. 1008.</ref> The corpses were taken to St. Paul's Catholic Hospital, where a French doctor made a formal statement of death without conducting an autopsy. The original death certificate did not describe Di\u1ec7m as Head of State but as \"Chief of Province\", a post he had held four decades earlier under the French colonial administration. Nhu was described as \"Chief of Library Service\", a post which he held in the 1940s.<ref name=s210/> This was interpreted as a Vietnamese way of expressing contempt for the two despised leaders. Their place of burial was never disclosed by the junta and rumours regarding it persist to the current day. The speculated burial places include a military prison, a local cemetery, the grounds of the JGS headquarters and there are reports of cremation as well.<ref name=s210>Shaplen, p. 210.</ref><ref>Jacobs, p. 189.</ref> Nobody was ever prosecuted for the killings.<ref>Jones, p. 180.</ref>\n\n==Memorial services==\nThe government did not approve a public memorial service for the deaths of Di\u1ec7m and Nhu until 1968. In 1971, several thousand mourners gathered at Di\u1ec7m's purported gravesite. Catholic prayers were given in [[Latin]]. Banners proclaimed Di\u1ec7m as a saviour of the south, with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Di\u1ec7m. Madame Thi\u1ec7u, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon's basilica. Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN. According to the eulogy, Di\u1ec7m died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country.<ref>Hammer, p. 317.</ref> Thi\u1ec7u sponsored the services, and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Di\u1ec7m's personal characteristics. Di\u1ec7m frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity, in contrast to Thi\u1ec7u, who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans. However, Thi\u1ec7u's attempts to associate himself with Di\u1ec7m's relative independence from United States influence was not successful.<ref>Lipsman and Weiss, pp. 156\u201357.</ref> According to General Maxwell Taylor, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, ''\"there was the memory of Di\u1ec7m to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall. By our complicity, we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves\"''.<ref>Hammer, p. 315.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Vietnam|Politics|1960s}}\n*{{cite book|title=Vietnam: A Dragon Embattled|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamdragonemb02butt|url-access=registration|authorlink=Joseph Buttinger|first=Joseph|last=Buttinger|year=1967|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York City, New York}}\n*{{cite book|title=A Death in November: America in Vietnam, 1963| authorlink=Ellen Hammer|first=Ellen J.|last=Hammer|year=1987|publisher=[[E.

Their native language is [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], one of only two surviving members of the [[Baltic language]] family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as [[Poles]], 6.31% as [[Russians]], 1.23% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while the [[Lietuvininkai]] who lived in the northern part of [[East Prussia]] prior to World War II, were mostly [[Evangelical Lutherans]].\n\n==History==\nThe territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities ([[Auk\u0161taitians]], [[Sudovians]], Old Lithuanians, [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]], [[Selonians]], [[Samogitians]], [[Skalvians]], [[Old Prussians]] (''[[Nadruvians]]'')), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Eastern Slavs]]. The last Pagan peoples in Europe, they were eventually [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted to Christianity]] in 1387.\n\nThe territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now [[Lithuania]], but also in northwestern [[Belarus]], in large areas of the territory of the modern [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia, and in some parts of modern [[Latvia]] and Poland.<ref>Glanville Price. Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe, 2000, pp.304\u2013306</ref>\n\nHowever, there is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, and a [[Polonization|preference for the Polish language]] in certain territories of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], as well as a preference for the [[German language]] in territories of the former [[East Prussia]] (now Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia) caused the number of Lithuanian speakers to decrease. The subsequent [[Russian Empire|imperial Russian]] occupation accelerated this process; it pursued a policy of [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|Russification]], which included a [[Lithuanian press ban|ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian]] (see, e.g., [[Knygne\u0161iai]], the actions against the Catholic Church). It was believed by some at the time that the nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century a [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian cultural and linguistic revival]] occurred. Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including [[Micha\u0142 Pius R\u00f6mer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Narutowicz]], [[Oscar Milosz]] and [[Tadas Ivanauskas]]. Lithuania [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|declared independence]] after World War I, which helped its national consolidation. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. However, the eastern parts of Lithuania, including the [[Vilnius Region]], were annexed by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], while the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]] was taken over by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939. In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], and forced to join it as the [[Lithuanian SSR]]. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941\u20131944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (''[[Lithuania Minor]]'') were almost destroyed as a result.\n\nThe Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, few villages in northeastern Poland, southern [[Latvia]] and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their number is small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the [[European Union]] on May 1, 2004.\n\n==Ethnic composition of Lithuania==\n{{Main|Demographics of Lithuania}}\nAmong the [[Baltic states]], Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as [[Poles]], 6.31% as [[Russians]], 1.23% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as [[Ukrainians]], [[Jews]], [[Germans]], [[Tatars]], [[Latvians]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Estonians]], [[Crimean Karaites]], [[Scandinavia]]ns etc.\n\nPoles are mostly concentrated in the [[Vilnius Region]]. Especially large Polish communities are located in the [[Vilnius District Municipality]] and the [[\u0160al\u010dininkai District Municipality]]. This concentration allows [[Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania]], an ethnic minority-based political party, to exert political influence. Due to the excessive pro-Pole political agenda, the party is known to cause friction between Lithuanians and Poles. However,  it has only held 1 or 2 seats in the parliament of Lithuania for the past decade. Thus, it is more active in local politics by having a majority in a few minor municipality councils.\n\nRussians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and do not have a strong political party. The most prominent community lives in the [[Visaginas Municipality]] (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]]. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.\n\nIn the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during [[the Holocaust]]. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern [[Jerusalem]], was about 30% Jewish.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Almost all its Jews were killed during [[The Holocaust in Lithuania|the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania]], some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 \u2013 1942,<ref>[[S\u00f6nke Neitzel]] & [[Harald Welzer]], ''Soldaten'' (''Protokolle vom K\u00e4mpfen, T\u00f6ten und Sterben''), Frankfurt am Main 2011, pp. 118\u2013120 (Hebrew edition translated from the German) {{ISBN|978-965-552-818-3}}</ref> while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel.

A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of [[Pu\u0144sk]] and [[Sejny]] in the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric [[Antanas Baranauskas]]. Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of [[Lithuania Minor]] that formed part of [[Prussia (region)|East Prussia]] were expelled when the area was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens.\n\nApart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n* Communities in the United States make up the largest part of this [[diaspora]]; as many as one million Americans can claim Lithuanian descent. Emigration to America began in the 19th century, with the generation calling itself the \u201cgrynoriai\u201d (derived from \u201c[[wiktionary:greenhorn|greenhorn]]\u201d meaning new and inexperienced).<ref name=\"Europeana\">{{cite web |last1=Mileryt\u0117-Japertien\u0117 |first1=Giedr\u0117 |title=Grynoriai: Lithuanian-American life in the early 20th century |url=http://blog.europeana.eu/2019/04/grynoriai-lithuanian-american-life-in-the-early-20th-century/ |website=[[Europeana]] (CC By-SA) |accessdate=5 May 2019 |date=2019-04-16}}</ref> The migration flow was interrupted during the Soviet occupation, when travel and emigration were severely restricted. The largest concentrations of [[Lithuanian Americans]] are in the [[Great Lakes]] area and the Northeast. Nearly 20,000 Lithuanians have immigrated to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.<ref>[https://www.dhs.gov/immigrationstatistics Immigration Statistics | Homeland Security<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Lithuanian communities in Canada are among the largest in the world along with the United States (See [[Lithuanian Canadian]]).\n* Lithuanian communities in Mexico and South America ([[Ethnography of Argentina#Lithuanians|Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], and Uruguay) developed before World War II, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Currently, there is no longer a flow of emigrants to these destinations, since economic conditions in those countries are not better than those in Lithuania (see [[Lithuanians in Brazil]]).\n* Lithuanian communities were formed in South Africa during the late 19th and 20th century, the majority being Jewish.\n* Lithuanian communities in other regions of the former Soviet Union were formed during the Soviet occupation; the numbers of Lithuanians in [[Siberia]] and Central Asia increased dramatically when a large portion of Lithuanians were involuntarily deported into these areas. After [[de-Stalinization]], however, most of them returned. Later, some Lithuanians were relocated to work in other areas of the Soviet Union; some of them did not return to Lithuania, after it became independent.\n* The Lithuanian communities in Western Europe (the [[Lithuanians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Lithuanians in Ireland|Ireland]], Spain, Sweden, and Norway) are very new and began to appear after the restoration of independence to Lithuania in 1990; this emigration intensified after Lithuania became part of the [[European Union]]. London and [[Glasgow]] (especially the [[Bellshill]] and [[Coatbridge]] areas of [[Greater Glasgow]]) have long had large Catholic and Jewish Lithuanian populations. The Republic of Ireland probably has the highest concentration of Lithuanians relative to its total population size in Western Europe; its estimated 45,000 Lithuanians (about half of whom are registered) form over 1% of Ireland's total population. In Norway there are 45,415 Lithuanians living in the country and it has in a short time become the second largest ethnic minority in the country, making up 0.85% of Norway's total population, and 4.81% of all [[Immigration to Norway|foreign residents]] in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Innvandrere etter landbakgrunn.

In 1950 they founded the Lithuanian High School in [[Diepholz]], which was a private school for children of Lithuanian refugees. For decades the Lithuanian High School was the only full-time high school outside the Eastern Bloc offering courses in Lithuanian history, language, and culture. In 1954, the Lithuanian Community acquired Rennhof Manor House with its twelve-acre park in the town of Lampertheim-H\u00fcttenfeld. The school was relocated there and still exists today.\n* Lithuanian communities in Australia exist as well; due to its great distance from Europe, however, emigration there was minuscule. There are Lithuanian communities in [[Melbourne]], [[Geelong]], Sydney, [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]] and [[Perth]].\n\n==Culture and traditions==\n{{Main|Culture of Lithuania}}\nThe Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be [[basketball]] (''krep\u0161inis''), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanian-American community]] in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996]], and [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2000 Summer Olympics]].\n\n[[Jonin\u0117s]] (also known as [[Rasos (festival)|Rasos]]) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. [[U\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s]] ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) takes place on the day before [[Ash Wednesday]], and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Lithuanian cuisine}}\n\nLithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's rich history.\n\nSince shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( ''kold\u016bnai''), doughnuts (''spurgos''), and crepes (''lietiniai blynai''). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding ([[kugelis]]) and potato sausages ([[v\u0117darai]]), as well as the [[baroque]] tree cake known as [[\u0161akotis]]. Traditional dishes of [[Lithuanian Tatars]] and [[Crimean Karaites#Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Lithuanian Karaites]] like [[Kibinai]] and [[Chiburekki|\u010deburekai]], that are similar to [[pasty]], are popular in Lithuania.\n\nFor Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of [[Halu\u0161ky|virtinukai]] (cabbage and noodles) and [[Halupki|baland\u0117liai]] (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular.\n\nThere are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional [[kastinys]] in [[\u017demaitija]], Western Lithuania, [[Skilandis]] in Western and Central Lithuania, [[Kindziukas]] in Eastern and Southern Lithuania ([[Dz\u016bkija]]).\n\n[[File:Sekacz.jpg|frame|right|Lithuanian ''\u0161akotis'']]\n\n[[Cepelinai]], a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark [[rye bread]], [[Cold Beet Soup|cold beet soup]] (\u0161altibar\u0161\u010diai), and [[kugelis]] (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. [[Lithuanian cuisine]] is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence.\n\nLithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lissau | first1 = I. |display-authors=etal  | date = January 2004 | title = Body mass index and overweight in adolescents in 13 European countries, Israel, and the United States | pmid = 14706954 | journal = Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine | volume = 158 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201333 | doi=10.1001/archpedi.158.1.27}}</ref> In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods.\n\nLithuanian has been brewing [[Midus]], a type of Lithuanian [[Mead]] for thousands of years.<ref>Antanas Astrauskas (2008), \u201ePer barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo...\u201c: svaigi\u0173j\u0173 g\u0117rim\u0173 istorija Lietuvoje {{ISBN|978-9955-23-141-7}}</ref>\n\nLocally brewed [[beer]] (''alus''), [[vodka]] (''degtin\u0117''), and [[kvass]] (''gira'') are popular drinks in Lithuania.

The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918\u201340) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was [[Vincas Kr\u0117v\u0117-Mickevi\u010dius]], a novelist and dramatist. His many works include ''Dainavos \u0161alies sen\u0173 \u017emoni\u0173 padavimai'' (Old Folks Tales of [[Dz\u016bkija|Dainava,]] 1912) and the historical dramas ''\u0160ar\u016bnas'' (1911), ''[[Skirgaila]]'' (1925), and ''Mindaugo mirtis'' (The Death of [[Mindaugas]], 1935). [[Petras Vai\u010di\u016bnas]] was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. [[Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas]] wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel ''Altori\u0173 \u0161e\u0161\u0117ly'' (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel.\n\n''[[Keturi v\u0117jai]]'' movement started with publication of ''The Prophet of the Four Winds'' by talented poet [[Kazys Binkis]] (1893\u20141942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of ''Keturi v\u0117jai'' initially was [[Futurism (art)|futurism]] which arrived through Russia from the West and later [[cubism]], [[dadaism]], [[surrealism]], [[unanimism]], and German [[expressionism]]. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tekstai.lt/tekstai/4vejai/apie/nyliunas.htm |title=Alfonsas Nyka-Nili\u016bnas.

He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near [[Mogilev]], [[Belarus]]) and graduated from [[Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries&nbsp;\u2014 Lithuania and Poland&nbsp;\u2014 he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, ''Lithuanian Tales and Stories''; 1933, ''Lithuanian Tales''; 1937, ''The origin of the Lithuanian Nation''.\n\n===Folk music===\n{{Main|Music of Lithuania}}\n[[File:Lithuanian folklore performance.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lithuanian folklore band [[Kulgrinda (band)|Kulgrinda]] performing in Vilnius]]\nLithuanian [[folk music]] is based around songs (''[[daina (Lithuania)|dainos]]''), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel [[chord (music)|chord]]s or [[unison]]. [[Duophonic]] songs are common in the renowned [[sutartin\u0117]]s tradition of [[Auk\u0161taitija]]. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called [[ratelis|rateliai]], a kind of [[round dance]]. Instrumentation includes [[kankl\u0117s]], a kind of [[zither]] that accompanies sutartin\u0117s, rateliai, [[waltz]]es, [[quadrille]]s and [[polka]]s, and [[fiddle]]s, (including a bass fiddle called the ''basetle'') and a kind of [[whistle]] called the [[Lamzdeliai]] ''lumzdelis''; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the [[concertina]], [[accordion]] and [[bandoneon]]. Sutartin\u0117 can be accompanied by ''skudu\u010diai'', a form of [[panpipes]] played by a group of people, as well as wooden [[trumpet]]s (''ragai'' and ''dandyt\u0117s''). Kankl\u0117s is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of [[Strings (music)|string]]s and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include ''\u0161vilpas'' whistle, drums and ''tabalas'' (a percussion instrument like a [[gong]]), ''[[sekmini\u0173 ragelis]]'' ([[bagpipe]]) and the ''p\u016bslin\u0117'', a [[musical bow]] made from a pig's bladder filled with dried peas.<ref name=\"Cronshaw\">Cronshaw, Andrew (2000). \u00abSinging Revolutions\u00bb, Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)

Their native language is [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], one of only two surviving members of the [[Baltic language]] family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as [[Poles]], 6.31% as [[Russians]], 1.23% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while the [[Lietuvininkai]] who lived in the northern part of [[East Prussia]] prior to World War II, were mostly [[Evangelical Lutherans]].\n\n==History==\nThe territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities ([[Auk\u0161taitians]], [[Sudovians]], Old Lithuanians, [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]], [[Selonians]], [[Samogitians]], [[Skalvians]], [[Old Prussians]] (''[[Nadruvians]]'')), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Eastern Slavs]]. The last Pagan peoples in Europe, they were eventually [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted to Christianity]] in 1387.\n\nThe territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now [[Lithuania]], but also in northwestern [[Belarus]], in large areas of the territory of the modern [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia, and in some parts of modern [[Latvia]] and Poland.<ref>Glanville Price. Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe, 2000, pp.304\u2013306</ref>\n\nHowever, there is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, and a [[Polonization|preference for the Polish language]] in certain territories of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], as well as a preference for the [[German language]] in territories of the former [[East Prussia]] (now Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia) caused the number of Lithuanian speakers to decrease. The subsequent [[Russian Empire|imperial Russian]] occupation accelerated this process; it pursued a policy of [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|Russification]], which included a [[Lithuanian press ban|ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian]] (see, e.g., [[Knygne\u0161iai]], the actions against the Catholic Church). It was believed by some at the time that the nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century a [[Lithuanian National Revival|Lithuanian cultural and linguistic revival]] occurred. Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including [[Micha\u0142 Pius R\u00f6mer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Narutowicz]], [[Oscar Milosz]] and [[Tadas Ivanauskas]]. Lithuania [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|declared independence]] after World War I, which helped its national consolidation. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. However, the eastern parts of Lithuania, including the [[Vilnius Region]], were annexed by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], while the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]] was taken over by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939. In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], and forced to join it as the [[Lithuanian SSR]]. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941\u20141944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (''[[Lithuania Minor]]'') were almost destroyed as a result.\n\nThe Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, few villages in northeastern Poland, southern [[Latvia]] and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their number is small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the [[European Union]] on May 1, 2004.\n\n==Ethnic composition of Lithuania==\n{{Main|Demographics of Lithuania}}\nAmong the [[Baltic states]], Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as [[Poles]], 6.31% as [[Russians]], 1.23% as [[Belarusians]], and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as [[Ukrainians]], [[Jews]], [[Germans]], [[Tatars]], [[Latvians]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Estonians]], [[Crimean Karaites]], [[Scandinavia]]ns etc.\n\nPoles are mostly concentrated in the [[Vilnius Region]]. Especially large Polish communities are located in the [[Vilnius District Municipality]] and the [[\u0160al\u010dininkai District Municipality]]. This concentration allows [[Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania]], an ethnic minority-based political party, to exert political influence. Due to the excessive pro-Pole political agenda, the party is known to cause friction between Lithuanians and Poles. However,  it has only held 1 or 2 seats in the parliament of Lithuania for the past decade. Thus, it is more active in local politics by having a majority in a few minor municipality councils.\n\nRussians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and do not have a strong political party. The most prominent community lives in the [[Visaginas Municipality]] (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]]. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.\n\nIn the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during [[the Holocaust]]. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern [[Jerusalem]], was about 30% Jewish.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Almost all its Jews were killed during [[The Holocaust in Lithuania|the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania]], some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 \u2013 1942,<ref>[[S\u00f6nke Neitzel]] & [[Harald Welzer]], ''Soldaten'' (''Protokolle vom K\u00e4mpfen, T\u00f6ten und Sterben''), Frankfurt am Main 2011, pp. 118\u2013120 (Hebrew edition translated from the German) {{ISBN|978-965-552-818-3}}</ref> while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel.

A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of [[Pu\u0144sk]] and [[Sejny]] in the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric [[Antanas Baranauskas]]. Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of [[Lithuania Minor]] that formed part of [[Prussia (region)|East Prussia]] were expelled when the area was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] as the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens.\n\nApart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n* Communities in the United States make up the largest part of this [[diaspora]]; as many as one million Americans can claim Lithuanian descent. Emigration to America began in the 19th century, with the generation calling itself the \u201cgrynoriai\u201d (derived from \u201c[[wiktionary:greenhorn|greenhorn]]\u201d meaning new and inexperienced).<ref name=\"Europeana\">{{cite web |last1=Mileryt\u0117-Japertien\u0117 |first1=Giedr\u0117 |title=Grynoriai: Lithuanian-American life in the early 20th century |url=http://blog.europeana.eu/2019/04/grynoriai-lithuanian-american-life-in-the-early-20th-century/ |website=[[Europeana]] (CC By-SA) |accessdate=5 May 2019 |date=2019-04-16}}</ref> The migration flow was interrupted during the Soviet occupation, when travel and emigration were severely restricted. The largest concentrations of [[Lithuanian Americans]] are in the [[Great Lakes]] area and the Northeast. Nearly 20,000 Lithuanians have immigrated to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.<ref>[https://www.dhs.gov/immigrationstatistics Immigration Statistics | Homeland Security<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* Lithuanian communities in Canada are among the largest in the world along with the United States (See [[Lithuanian Canadian]]).\n* Lithuanian communities in Mexico and South America ([[Ethnography of Argentina#Lithuanians|Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], and Uruguay) developed before World War II, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Currently, there is no longer a flow of emigrants to these destinations, since economic conditions in those countries are not better than those in Lithuania (see [[Lithuanians in Brazil]]).\n* Lithuanian communities were formed in South Africa during the late 19th and 20th century, the majority being Jewish.\n* Lithuanian communities in other regions of the former Soviet Union were formed during the Soviet occupation; the numbers of Lithuanians in [[Siberia]] and Central Asia increased dramatically when a large portion of Lithuanians were involuntarily deported into these areas. After [[de-Stalinization]], however, most of them returned. Later, some Lithuanians were relocated to work in other areas of the Soviet Union; some of them did not return to Lithuania, after it became independent.\n* The Lithuanian communities in Western Europe (the [[Lithuanians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Lithuanians in Ireland|Ireland]], Spain, Sweden, and Norway) are very new and began to appear after the restoration of independence to Lithuania in 1990; this emigration intensified after Lithuania became part of the [[European Union]]. London and [[Glasgow]] (especially the [[Bellshill]] and [[Coatbridge]] areas of [[Greater Glasgow]]) have long had large Catholic and Jewish Lithuanian populations. The Republic of Ireland probably has the highest concentration of Lithuanians relative to its total population size in Western Europe; its estimated 45,000 Lithuanians (about half of whom are registered) form over 1% of Ireland\u2019s total population. In Norway there are 45,415 Lithuanians living in the country and it has in a short time become the second largest ethnic minority in the country, making up 0.85% of Norway\u2019s total population, and 4.81% of all [[Immigration to Norway|foreign residents]] in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Innvandrere etter landbakgrunn.

In 1950 they founded the Lithuanian High School in [[Diepholz]], which was a private school for children of Lithuanian refugees. For decades the Lithuanian High School was the only full-time high school outside the Eastern Bloc offering courses in Lithuanian history, language, and culture. In 1954, the Lithuanian Community acquired Rennhof Manor House with its twelve-acre park in the town of Lampertheim-H\u00fcttenfeld. The school was relocated there and still exists today.\n* Lithuanian communities in Australia exist as well; due to its great distance from Europe, however, emigration there was minuscule. There are Lithuanian communities in [[Melbourne]], [[Geelong]], Sydney, [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]] and [[Perth]].\n\n==Culture and traditions==\n{{Main|Culture of Lithuania}}\nThe Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be [[basketball]] (''krep\u0161inis''), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanian-American community]] in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996]], and [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2000 Summer Olympics]].\n\n[[Jonin\u0117s]] (also known as [[Rasos (festival)|Rasos]]) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. [[U\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s]] ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) takes place on the day before [[Ash Wednesday]], and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Lithuanian cuisine}}\n\nLithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's rich history.\n\nSince shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( ''kold\u016bnai''), doughnuts (''spurgos''), and crepes (''lietiniai blynai''). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding ([[kugelis]]) and potato sausages ([[v\u0117darai]]), as well as the [[baroque]] tree cake known as [[\u0161akotis]]. Traditional dishes of [[Lithuanian Tatars]] and [[Crimean Karaites#Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Lithuanian Karaites]] like [[Kibinai]] and [[Chiburekki|\u010deburekai]], that are similar to [[pasty]], are popular in Lithuania.\n\nFor Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of [[Halu\u0161ky|virtinukai]] (cabbage and noodles) and [[Halupki|baland\u0117liai]] (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular.\n\nThere are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional [[kastinys]] in [[\u017demaitija]], Western Lithuania, [[Skilandis]] in Western and Central Lithuania, [[Kindziukas]] in Eastern and Southern Lithuania ([[Dz\u016bkija]]).\n\n[[File:Sekacz.jpg|frame|right|Lithuanian ''\u0161akotis'']]\n\n[[Cepelinai]], a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark [[rye bread]], [[Cold Beet Soup|cold beet soup]] (\u0161altibar\u0161\u010diai), and [[kugelis]] (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. [[Lithuanian cuisine]] is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence.\n\nLithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lissau | first1 = I. |display-authors=etal  | date = January 2004 | title = Body mass index and overweight in adolescents in 13 European countries, Israel, and the United States | pmid = 14706954 | journal = Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine | volume = 158 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201333 | doi=10.1001/archpedi.158.1.27}}</ref> In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods.\n\nLithuanian has been brewing [[Midus]], a type of Lithuanian [[Mead]] for thousands of years.<ref>Antanas Astrauskas (2008), \u201ePer barzd\u0105 varv\u0117jo...\u201c: svaigi\u0173j\u0173 g\u0117rim\u0173 istorija Lietuvoje {{ISBN|978-9955-23-141-7}}</ref>\n\nLocally brewed [[beer]] (''alus''), [[vodka]] (''degtin\u0117''), and [[kvass]] (''gira'') are popular drinks in Lithuania.

The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918\u201340) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was [[Vincas Kr\u0117v\u0117-Mickevi\u010dius]], a novelist and dramatist. His many works include ''Dainavos \u0161alies sen\u0173 \u017emoni\u0173 padavimai'' (Old Folks Tales of [[Dz\u016bkija|Dainava,]] 1912) and the historical dramas ''\u0160ar\u016bnas'' (1911), ''[[Skirgaila]]'' (1925), and ''Mindaugo mirtis'' (The Death of [[Mindaugas]], 1935). [[Petras Vai\u010di\u016bnas]] was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. [[Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas]] wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel ''Altori\u0173 \u0161e\u0161\u0117ly'' (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel.\n\n''[[Keturi v\u0117jai]]'' movement started with publication of ''The Prophet of the Four Winds'' by talented poet [[Kazys Binkis]] (1893\u20141942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of ''Keturi v\u0117jai'' initially was [[Futurism (art)|futurism]] which arrived through Russia from the West and later [[cubism]], [[dadaism]], [[surrealism]], [[unanimism]], and German [[expressionism]]. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tekstai.lt/tekstai/4vejai/apie/nyliunas.htm |title=Alfonsas Nyka-Nili\u016bnas.

He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near [[Mogilev]], [[Belarus]]) and graduated from [[Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries&nbsp;\u2014 Lithuania and Poland&nbsp;\u2014 he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, ''Lithuanian Tales and Stories''; 1933, ''Lithuanian Tales''; 1937, ''The origin of the Lithuanian Nation''.\n\n===Folk music===\n{{Main|Music of Lithuania}}\n[[File:Lithuanian folklore performance.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lithuanian folklore band [[Kulgrinda (band)|Kulgrinda]] performing in Vilnius]]\nLithuanian [[folk music]] is based around songs (''[[daina (Lithuania)|dainos]]''), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel [[chord (music)|chord]]s or [[unison]]. [[Duophonic]] songs are common in the renowned [[sutartin\u0117]]s tradition of [[Auk\u0161taitija]]. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called [[ratelis|rateliai]], a kind of [[round dance]]. Instrumentation includes [[kankl\u0117s]], a kind of [[zither]] that accompanies sutartin\u0117s, rateliai, [[waltz]]es, [[quadrille]]s and [[polka]]s, and [[fiddle]]s, (including a bass fiddle called the ''basetle'') and a kind of [[whistle]] called the [[Lamzdeliai]] ''lumzdelis''; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the [[concertina]], [[accordion]] and [[bandoneon]]. Sutartin\u0117 can be accompanied by ''skudu\u010diai'', a form of [[panpipes]] played by a group of people, as well as wooden [[trumpet]]s (''ragai'' and ''dandyt\u0117s''). Kankl\u0117s is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of [[Strings (music)|string]]s and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include ''\u0161vilpas'' whistle, drums and ''tabalas'' (a percussion instrument like a [[gong]]), ''[[sekmini\u0173 ragelis]]'' ([[bagpipe]]) and the ''p\u016bslin\u0117'', a [[musical bow]] made from a pig\u2019s bladder filled with dried peas.<ref name=\"Cronshaw\">Cronshaw, Andrew (2000). \u00abSinging Revolutions\u00bb, Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)
