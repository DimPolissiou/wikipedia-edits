This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. His discoveries overturned a 60-year old dogma that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick demonstrated that normal cells have a memory and can remember at what doubling level they have reached. He demonstrated that his normal human cell strains were free from contaminating viruses. His cell strain [[WI-38]] soon replaced primary monkey kidney cells and became the substrate for the production of most of the world's human virus vaccines. Hayflick discovered that the etiological agent of primary [[atypical pneumonia]] (also called \"walking pneumonia\") was not a virus as previously believed. He was the first to cultivate the causative organism called a [[mycoplasma]], the smallest free-living organism, which Hayflick isolated on a unique culture medium that bears his name. He named the organism ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''.\n\nIn 1959, Hayflick developed the first [[inverted microscope]] for use in [[cell culture]] research. To this day, all inverted microscopes used in cell culture laboratories worldwide are descended from this prototype.

Hayflick is a member of numerous national and international scientific and public boards of directors and committees.  He is now, or has been, on the Editorial Boards of more than ten professional journals. Hayflick was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal \u201cExperimental Gerontology\u201d for 13 years.\n\nHe is a member of twenty scientific and professional societies in which he has held several high offices including President of the Gerontological Society of America from 1982 to 1983. He was a founding member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging, NIH and Chairman of its Executive Committee. He was a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and the [[World Health Organization]], and is now a member of several scientific advisory boards.  He was Chairman of the Scientific Review Board of the American Federation for Aging Research where he was also a vice president and a Member of the Board of Directors. He was also recruited by [[Michael D. West]], founder of [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] ({{NASDAQ|GERN}}) and current CEO of [[BioTime]], to join the company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, on which he served from 1991-2000. Hayflick was also a consultant at [[Genentech]] from a year after its founding and for the next 25 years. He developed their technology for growing animal cells in fermentation tanks in which most of their products were produced.\n\nHayflick is one of several prominent biologists featured in the 1995 science [[documentary]] [[Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times|''Death by Design: The Life and Times of Life and Times'']].\n\n== Research ==\nHayflick is known for his research in [[cell biology]], virus vaccine development, and [[mycoplasma|mycoplasmology]]. In 1962 he discovered that, contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, cultured normal human and animal cells have a limited capacity for replication.  This discovery, known as the [[Hayflick limit]], overturned a long-held belief bolstered by [[Alexis Carrel]]'s work in the early 20th century that claimed that normal cells would proliferate continuously in culture. Hayflick found that only cancer cells are immortal and that normal cells have a mechanism for remembering what replication level they are at. He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal, to be an indication of aging at the cellular level. Hayflick demonstrated for the first time that mortal (normal) and immortal (malignant) mammalian cells existed.\n\nHayflick developed the first normal human [[diploid]] cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world. Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and [[aneuploid]]. One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorhead at the [[Wistar Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], called [[WI-38]], has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses. He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses. Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people.<ref name=\"The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity\">{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=S.J.|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|title=The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity|journal=AIMS Public Health|date=2 March 2017|volume=4|issue=2|pages=127\u2013138|doi=10.3934/publichealth.2017.2.127|pmid=29546209|pmc=5689800}}</ref>\n\nHayflick produced the first oral [[polio]] vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38. WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere. WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus [[vaccine]]s produced throughout the world including those for [[poliomyelitis]], rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign versions of Hayflick's original WI-38.<ref name=\"The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity\" />\n\nHayflick is also known for his discovery of the cause of primary atypical pneumonia (\u201c[[walking pneumonia]]\u201d) in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chanock|first1=RM|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|last3=Barile|first3=MF|title=Growth on artificial medium of an agent associated with atypical pneumonia and its identification as a PPLO.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 January 1962|volume=48|issue=1|pages=41\u20139|pmid=13878126|pmc=285494|doi=10.1073/pnas.48.1.41|bibcode=1962PNAS...48...41C}}</ref> The etiological agent was first thought to be a virus, but Hayflick showed that it was, in fact, a [[mycoplasma]], a member of the smallest free-living class of microorganisms.  The etiological agent was named by him as ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name. It is now used worldwide for mycoplasma isolation and research.\n\nHayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the [[International Association of Gerontology]], and the Presidential Award from [[The International Organization for Mycoplasmology]]. Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious [[John Scott Award]] in 2014. This is the oldest scientific award in the United States, established in 1823 in honor of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] founder [[Michael D. West]] to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geron Corporation 10K 1996|url= http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996-May/002331.html}}</ref> In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Biologie of France. In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the [[Lord Cohen Medal|Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal]] by the [[British Society for Research on Ageing]]. The [[American Aging Association]] established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997. A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] in 2000. Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his \"...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells...\" A third Annual Hayflick Lecture was established at the [[Friedrich Schiller University]] in 2013.\n\nHayflick is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology. Hayflick is the author of over 275 scientific papers, book chapters and edited books of which four papers are among the 100 most cited scientific papers of the two million papers published in the basic biomedical sciences from 1961 to 1978.\n\nThe [[inverted microscope]] that Hayflick modified for use in his tissue culture and mycoplasma work and on which all other such microscopes have been modeled has been acquired by the [[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian National Museum of American History]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right\n | headerimage = \n | video1 = [http://www.webofstories.com/play/leonard.hayflick/1 Childhood in Pennsylvania], Leonard Hayflick interview, 1:43, 1st of 187 parts, [[Web of Stories]].<ref name=\"WebofS\">{{cite web | title = Childhood in Pennsylvania | website = | publisher = [[Web of Stories]] | date = 8 August 2012 | url = http://www.webofstories.com/play/leonard.hayflick/1 | accessdate = 19 May 2013 }}</ref>\n }}\n* [[Biogerontology]]\n* [[Hayflick limit]]\n* [[Senescence]]\n* [[Tissue engineering]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Meredith Wadman]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Vaccine_Race.html?id=McMiDAAAQBAJ ''The Vaccine Race:  Science, Politics and the Human Costs of Defeating Disease''], 2017.\n* See also Hayflick's comments on Wadman's book, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323666095_Errors_in_The_Vaccine_Race_book ''Errors in \"The Vaccine Race\" book'']\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/192/4235/125.extract Hayflick's Tragedy: The Rise and Fall of a Human Cell Line.

He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal, to be an indication of aging at the cellular level. Hayflick demonstrated for the first time that mortal (normal) and immortal (malignant) mammalian cells existed.\n\nHayflick developed the first normal human [[diploid]] cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world. Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and [[aneuploid]]. One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorhead at the [[Wistar Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], called [[WI-38]], has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses. He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses. Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people.<ref name=\"The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity\">{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=S.J.|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|title=The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity|journal=AIMS Public Health|date=2 March 2017|volume=4|issue=2|pages=127\u2013138|doi=10.3934/publichealth.2017.2.127|pmid=29546209|pmc=5689800}}</ref>\n\nHayflick produced the first oral [[polio]] vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38. WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere. WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus [[vaccine]]s produced throughout the world including those for [[poliomyelitis]], rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign versions of Hayflick's original WI-38.<ref name=\"The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity\" />\n\nHayflick is also known for his discovery of the cause of primary atypical pneumonia (\u201c[[walking pneumonia]]\u201d) in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chanock|first1=RM|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|last3=Barile|first3=MF|title=Growth on artificial medium of an agent associated with atypical pneumonia and its identification as a PPLO.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 January 1962|volume=48|issue=1|pages=41\u20139|pmid=13878126|pmc=285494|doi=10.1073/pnas.48.1.41|bibcode=1962PNAS...48...41C}}</ref> The etiological agent was first thought to be a virus, but Hayflick showed that it was, in fact, a [[mycoplasma]], a member of the smallest free-living class of microorganisms.  The etiological agent was named by him as ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name. It is now used worldwide for mycoplasma isolation and research.\n\nHayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the [[International Association of Gerontology]], and the Presidential Award from [[The International Organization for Mycoplasmology]]. Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious [[John Scott Award]] in 2014. This is the oldest scientific award in the United States, established in 1823 in honor of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] founder [[Michael D. West]] to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geron Corporation 10K 1996|url= http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996-May/002331.html}}</ref> In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Biologie of France. In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the [[Lord Cohen Medal|Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal]] by the [[British Society for Research on Ageing]]. The [[American Aging Association]] established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997. A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] in 2000. Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his \"...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells...\" A third Annual Hayflick Lecture was established at the [[Friedrich Schiller University]] in 2013.\n\nHayflick is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology.

Thus Majumdar declared an \"annihilation line\", a dictum that Naxalites should assassinate individual \"class enemies\" (such as landlords, businessmen, university teachers, police officers, politicians of the right and left) and others.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Sen, Antara Dev |date=25 March 2010|title=A true leader of the unwashed masses|newspaper=DNA (Diligent Media Corporation)|location=Mumbai, India|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column_a-true-leader-of-the-unwashed-masses_1363010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107190230/http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-a-true-leader-of-the-unwashed-masses-1363010|archivedate=7 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Dasgupta, Biplab|year=1973|title=Naxalite Armed Struggles and the Annihilation Campaign in Rural Areas|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=1973|pages=173\u2013188 |url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/audience.nsf/b1bc9409c64d85a06525698d0025dc3c/5813146ae3eeee2e652572870041e297/$FILE/A0260027.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127164644/http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/audience.nsf/b1bc9409c64d85a06525698d0025dc3c/5813146ae3eeee2e652572870041e297/$FILE/A0260027.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe chief minister, [[Siddhartha Shankar Ray]] of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], instituted strong counter-measures against the Naxalites. The West Bengal police fought back to stop the Naxalites. The house of Somen Mitra, the Congress MLA of Sealdah, was allegedly turned into a torture chamber where Naxals were incarcerated illegally by police and the Congress cadres. CPI-M cadres were also involved in the \"state terror\". After suffering losses and facing the public rejection of Majumdar's \"annihilation line\", the Naxalites alleged human rights violations by the West Bengal police, who responded that the state was effectively fighting a civil war and that democratic pleasantries had no place in a war, especially when the opponent did not fight within the norms of democracy and civility.<ref name=\"rediff\"/>\n\nLarge sections of the Naxal movement began to question Majumdar's leadership. In 1971 the CPI(ML) was split, as [[Satyanarayan Singh]] revolted against Majumdar's leadership. In 1972 Majumdar was arrested by the police and died in [[Alipore Jail]] presumably as a result of torture. His death accelerated the fragmentation of the movement.\n\n=== Operation Steeplechase ===\n{{see also|Operation Green Hunt}}\nIn July 1971, [[Indira Gandhi]] took advantage of [[President's rule]] to mobilise the [[Indian Army]] against the Naxalites and launched a colossal combined army and police counter-insurgency operation, termed ''\"Operation Steeplechase,\"'' killing hundreds of Naxalites and imprisoning more than 20,000 suspects and cadres, including senior leaders.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Maoist Insurgency in Nepal: Revolution in the Twenty-first Century |chapter=Part V: Military and state dimension |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtGNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&output=text#c_top |page=208 |first1=Mahendra |last1=Lawoti |first2=Anup Kumar |last2=Pahari |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-135-26168-9 |quote=The second turning point came in the wake of the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence which India supported with armed troops.
