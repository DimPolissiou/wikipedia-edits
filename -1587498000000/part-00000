The first ordinance allows the city manager the abilities to close any city facility in order to ensure the health and safety of city employees and the community, to enter into temporary agreements with bargaining units to ensure continuation of city services and to adjust personnel policies, designate areas for carry-out and curbside pickup from restaurants in the downtown area of the city, and to extend deadlines for licenses issued under the city code.  The ordinance also officially suspends the charging late fees for water and sewer, stopping the disconnection of water and sewer service for non-payment, extension of the payment deadline of the city's food and beverage tax along with the package liquor tax until May 20, extends the motor fuel taxes and hotel/motel taxes until April 30. An additional item that was added was the suspension of the enforcement of the tall grass and weed ordinance.  The second ordinance allowed for a streamlined process of the enforcement of the multiple executive orders issued by Governor Pritzker. Typically these orders would be sent through the [[Jackson County, Illinois|Jackson County Health Department]] and then to the [[Illinois Department of Public Health]] for review and then off to the county state's attorney for enforcement. Instead these orders will be processed by the City of Carbondale and enforced by the Carbondale Police Department by way of fines up to $750 per day and alleviates a \"minor violation from becoming a misdemeanor or felony charge\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Issac |title=Carbondale City Council passes ordinance to declare emergency in response to COVID-19 |url=https://thesouthern.com/news/local/carbondale-city-council-passes-ordinance-to-declare-emergency-in-response-to-covid-19/article_6da6480b-8857-52c6-affe-99bf52cf5521.html |website=The Southern Illinoisian |accessdate=April 12, 2020 |date=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== City of Chicago ====\nOn March 12, Chicago Mayor [[Lori Lightfoot]] announced that after meeting with [[Comcast]] executives, the company would \"double internet speeds to low income households nationally.
