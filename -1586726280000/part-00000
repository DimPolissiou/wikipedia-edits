Ba\u010dka managed to qualify to the final stages of the national cup on several occasions, the next being in the [[1993\u201394 FR Yugoslavia Cup]] when they lost in the last 16 against [[FK Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161|Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161]].<ref name=\"istorija\"/>\n\nAfter the 1988\u201389 season in the Second League, during the following two decades the club played mostly in the third national level, the [[Serbian League Vojvodina]], occasionally dropping to the [[Ba\u010dka Zone League]] at times when the financial crisis was more notorious. The rise started when Ba\u010dka won the 2012\u201313 [[Vojvodina League West]]. Immediately afterwards, Ba\u010dka won the [[2013\u201314 Serbian League Vojvodina]] thus qualifying to the [[Serbian First League]], the second national level.<ref name=\"istorija\"/> It only took two seasons in the first league for Ba\u010dka to finish second in the [[2015\u201316 Serbian First League|2015\u201316 edition]] and this way directly qualified for the [[Serbian SuperLiga]].  The [[2016\u201317 Serbian SuperLiga]] was the first time in the club's history that Ba\u010dka played in the national top level.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the club always was ''FK Ba\u010dka''. It comes from the region of [[Ba\u010dka]] where the city Ba\u010dka Palanka is located.  The club should not be confused with another one with same name, [[FK Ba\u010dka 1901]].  That club is from [[Subotica]] and was founded in 1901, making him the oldest club not only in the territory of present-day Serbia, but in all of former [[Yugoslavia]].  FK Ba\u010dka 1901 played in several editions of the [[Yugoslav First League]] during the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] period, prior [[Second World War]], however later and more recently both often competed at same lower levels. While FK Ba\u010dka 1901 played in Yugoslav First League, more recently didn't manage more than playing in [[Serbian League Vojvodina]], third level while FK Ba\u010dka Ba\u010dka Palanka never played in Yugoslav highest level, but in 2016 got to be promoted to the Serbian SuperLiga. A third club including the name Ba\u010dka is [[TSC Ba\u010dka Topola]] which never played top-level but on several occasions reached second levels both during the time of Yugoslavia and after. However, this case is different because ''Ba\u010dka'' is included only because of the name of the city they are located at, [[Ba\u010dka Topola]]. In summer 2015, club name changed to OFK Ba\u010dka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fss.rs/documents/fudbal_32.pdf|title=\"FUDBAL\" 32/15 \u2013 page 3016|website=[[Football Association of Serbia]]|language=Serbian|date=12 August 2015|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\n;[[Serbian League Vojvodina]]\n*Winner: [[2013\u201314 Serbian League Vojvodina|2013\u201314]]<ref name=\"istorija\"/>\n;[[Vojvodina League West]]\n*Winner: 2012\u201313<ref name=\"istorija\"/>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main article|Stadion Slavko Maletin Vava}}\n[[File:Stadion Slavko Maletin Vava.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Slavko Maletin Vava Stadium west stand]]\nThe Ba\u010dka [[stadium]], known as Stadion Slavko Maletin Vava, was inaugurated on the date the city of Ba\u010dka Palanka celebrates its [[slava]], July 7, 1951.

The rise started when Ba\u010dka won the 2012\u201313 [[Vojvodina League West]]. Immediately afterwards, Ba\u010dka won the [[2013\u201314 Serbian League Vojvodina]] thus qualifying to the [[Serbian First League]], the second national level.<ref name=\"istorija\"/> It only took two seasons in the first league for Ba\u010dka to finish second in the [[2015\u201316 Serbian First League|2015\u201316 edition]] and this way directly qualified for the [[Serbian SuperLiga]].  The [[2016\u201317 Serbian SuperLiga]] was the first time in the club's history that Ba\u010dka played in the national top level.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the club always was ''FK Ba\u010dka''. It comes from the region of [[Ba\u010dka]] where the city Ba\u010dka Palanka is located.  The club should not be confused with another one with same name, [[FK Ba\u010dka 1901]].  That club is from [[Subotica]] and was founded in 1901, making him the oldest club not only in the territory of present-day Serbia, but in all of former [[Yugoslavia]].  FK Ba\u010dka 1901 played in several editions of the [[Yugoslav First League]] during the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] period, prior [[Second World War]], however later and more recently both often competed at same lower levels. While FK Ba\u010dka 1901 played in Yugoslav First League, more recently didn't manage more than playing in [[Serbian League Vojvodina]], third level while FK Ba\u010dka Ba\u010dka Palanka never played in Yugoslav highest level, but in 2016 got to be promoted to the Serbian SuperLiga. A third club including the name Ba\u010dka is [[TSC Ba\u010dka Topola]] which never played top-level but on several occasions reached second levels both during the time of Yugoslavia and after. However, this case is different because ''Ba\u010dka'' is included only because of the name of the city they are located at, [[Ba\u010dka Topola]]. In summer 2015, club name changed to OFK Ba\u010dka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fss.rs/documents/fudbal_32.pdf|title=\"FUDBAL\" 32/15 \u2013 page 3016|website=[[Football Association of Serbia]]|language=Serbian|date=12 August 2015|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\n;[[Serbian League Vojvodina]]\n*Winner: [[2013\u201314 Serbian League Vojvodina|2013\u201314]]<ref name=\"istorija\"/>\n;[[Vojvodina League West]]\n*Winner: 2012\u201313<ref name=\"istorija\"/>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main article|Stadion Slavko Maletin Vava}}\n[[File:Stadion Slavko Maletin Vava.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Slavko Maletin Vava Stadium west stand]]\nThe Ba\u010dka [[stadium]], known as Stadion Slavko Maletin Vava, was inaugurated on the date the city of Ba\u010dka Palanka celebrates its [[slava]], July 7, 1951.
