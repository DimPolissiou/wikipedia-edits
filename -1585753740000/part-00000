They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the [[Marxist]] [[communism]] tradition.\n\nThe formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] within the [[Communist International]]. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in [[one-party states]] like the [[Communist Party of China]] or the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or as ruling parties in [[multi-party system]]s, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.\n\nMany other communist parties did not govern any country, but they did govern several states or region within a particular countries.

I've got no reputation. I have no money. I've got nothing\" to Tony Messenger of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.<ref name=\":14\" /> These difficulties were eventually rectified when he joined Schultz Surveying and Engineering Inc. He has since continued to have a career in content marketing and crisis management.<ref name=\":16\" /> He has also become the author of several books on biblical teachings and how to recover from personal crisis.<ref name=\"SBJ Names Jetton\" /><ref name=\"The Arena\" />\n\nJetton attributed his failings to alcoholism, disconnection from his faith, and a lack of balance in his life. He has said that his time in the House of Representatives was a hectic self-indulgent period, that increasingly led him to a lifestyle standing in opposition to his personal beliefs. The restoration of personal Christian values and a more balanced lifestyle are reoccurring themes in his writing. He has credited support from his family and his returning faith in God for helping him to rebuild his life.<ref name=\"Former House Speaker returns\" /><ref name=\"Rosenbaum - Power Broker\" /><ref name=\"Isn't Afraid\" />\n\n=== Schultz Surveying and Engineering Inc. ===\nJetton was the director of marketing for Schultz Surveying and Engineering Inc. from 2010 to 2013.<ref name=\"The Arena\" /> During this period, the company made the [[Inc. 500|Inc. 500/5000]] list three times, increased federal revenue from $800,000 in 2009 to over $3 million by 2011, and reached #54th on the ZweigWhite Hot Firm's List, making it the second fastest growing engineering company in Missouri to be placed on the ZweigWhite Hot Firm's List. The company's owners, attributed much of the company's success to Jetton's aggressive marketing efforts, especially the customer database he created, the revisions he made to the company's website, and the contact plan that he helped to develop.

He became known to the general public following his coauthoring a paper on what is popularly known as [[Bible code]], the supposed coded messaging in the Hebrew text of the [[Torah]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kmph.com/story/16664855/kmph-special-report-bible-codes-2012 |title=Secret Codes In The Bible And The Torah?

His mother was Jewish and from [[Riga]], the only of nine siblings that survived the war; the others were killed in [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]] and other places. His father Aaron was a Jewish mathematician from [[Belarus]]; his wife, children and all of his relatives were killed during [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://satori.lv/raksts/11284/Lolita_Tomsone/Serkocins_Ripss |author=Lolita Tomsone |title=S\u0113rkoci\u0146\u0161 Ripss |publisher=Satori |language=Latvian |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nRips was the first high school student from Latvia to participate in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. In January 1969 he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast---then illegal in the USSR---of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student [[Jan Palach]]. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the [[University of Latvia]], attempted [[self-immolation]] in a protest against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked cloths ablaze. A group of bystanders were able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips' neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated.  He was incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. After his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a wave of petitions, Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, he was allowed to [[aliyah|immigrate]] to [[Israel]].\n\nRips joined the Department of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the  [[Aharon Karzir Prize]]. In 1979, Rips received the [[Erd\u0151s Prize]] from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994.\n\n==Academic career==\nRips is a professor in the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University. His research interests are geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees.\n\nRips' work on [[Group action (mathematics)|group actions]] on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees is mostly unpublished. The [[Rips machine]], in the hands of Rips and his student [[Zlil Sela]], has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the [[Group isomorphism problem|isomorphism problem]] for [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\n==''The Bible Code'' controversy==\n{{main|Bible code}}\nIn the late 1970s, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah. In 1994, Rips, together with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg, published in the journal ''[[Statistical Science]]'' an article, \"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\", which claimed the discovery of encoded messages in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text of the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/2004/08/18/ft/article9PRR2.html |title=Botschaften des Allm\u00e4chtigen oder zurechtgeschusterte Daten? |date=2004-08-18 |work=[[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]] |accessdate=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122041752/http://www.nzz.ch/2004/08/18/ft/article9PRR2.html |archivedate=2008-01-22}}</ref> This, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1997 book ''[[The Bible Code]]'' by journalist [[Michael Drosnin]]. While Rips originally claimed{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} that he agreed with Drosnin's findings, in 1997 Rips described Drosnin's book as \"on very shaky ground\" and \"of no value.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1997/06/08/seek-and-ye-shall-find.html |title=Seek And Ye Shall Find |author=Sharon Begley |date=1997-06-08 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=2012-02-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508055008/https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1997/06/08/seek-and-ye-shall-find.html |archivedate=2012-05-08}}</ref> Since Drosnin's book, [[Bible code]]s have been a subject of controversy, with the claims being criticized by [[Brendan McKay]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/dilugim/torah.html |title=Torah Codes |website=cs.anu.edu.au |access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> An early supporter of Rips' theories was [[Robert Aumann]], Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 2005, who headed a commission overseeing Rips' experiments attempting to prove the existence of a secret code from God in the [[Torah]].

He became known to the general public following his coauthoring a paper on what is popularly known as [[Bible code]], the supposed coded messaging in the Hebrew text of the [[Torah]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kmph.com/story/16664855/kmph-special-report-bible-codes-2012 |title=Secret Codes In The Bible And The Torah?

His mother was Jewish and from [[Riga]], the only of nine siblings that survived the war; the others were killed in [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]] and other places. His father Aaron was a Jewish mathematician from [[Belarus]]; his wife, children and all of his relatives were killed during [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://satori.lv/raksts/11284/Lolita_Tomsone/Serkocins_Ripss |author=Lolita Tomsone |title=S\u0113rkoci\u0146\u0161 Ripss |publisher=Satori |language=Latvian |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> \n\nRips was the first high school student from Latvia to participate in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. In January 1969 he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast---then illegal in the USSR---of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student [[Jan Palach]]. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the [[University of Latvia]], attempted [[self-immolation]] in a protest against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked cloths ablaze. A group of bystanders were able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips' neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated.  He was incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. After his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a wave of petitions, Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, he was allowed to [[aliyah|immigrate]] to [[Israel]].\n\nRips joined the Department of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the  [[Aharon Karzir Prize]]. In 1979, Rips received the [[Erd\u0151s Prize]] from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994.\n\n==Academic career==\nRips is a professor in the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University. His research interests are geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees.\n\nRips' work on [[Group action (mathematics)|group actions]] on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees is mostly unpublished. The [[Rips machine]], in the hands of Rips and his student [[Zlil Sela]], has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the [[Group isomorphism problem|isomorphism problem]] for [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\n==''The Bible Code'' controversy==\n{{main|Bible code}}\nIn the late 1970s, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah. In 1994, Rips, together with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg, published in the journal ''[[Statistical Science]]'' an article, \"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\", which claimed the discovery of encoded messages in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text of the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzz.ch/2004/08/18/ft/article9PRR2.html |title=Botschaften des Allm\u00e4chtigen oder zurechtgeschusterte Daten? |date=2004-08-18 |work=[[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]] |accessdate=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122041752/http://www.nzz.ch/2004/08/18/ft/article9PRR2.html |archivedate=2008-01-22}}</ref> This, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1997 book ''[[The Bible Code]]'' by journalist [[Michael Drosnin]]. While Rips originally claimed{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} that he agreed with Drosnin's findings, in 1997 Rips described Drosnin's book as \"on very shaky ground\" and \"of no value.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1997/06/08/seek-and-ye-shall-find.html |title=Seek And Ye Shall Find |author=Sharon Begley |date=1997-06-08 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=2012-02-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508055008/https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1997/06/08/seek-and-ye-shall-find.html |archivedate=2012-05-08}}</ref> Since Drosnin's book, [[Bible code]]s have been a subject of controversy, with the claims being criticized by [[Brendan McKay]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/dilugim/torah.html |title=Torah Codes |website=cs.anu.edu.au |access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> An early supporter of Rips' theories was [[Robert Aumann]], Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 2005, who headed a commission overseeing Rips' experiments attempting to prove the existence of a secret code from God in the [[Torah]]. Eventually, Aumann abandoned the idea and withdrew his support from Rips.\n\n''[[The Bible Code]]'' treats the text of the Bible as a [[word search]] puzzle: for example, a word may be spelled diagonally moving in a north west direction, or perhaps left-to-right taking every second letter.
