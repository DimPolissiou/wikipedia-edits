Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces. It has sometimes been sold as '''Standard''' or '''Basic Commercial''' in English-speaking countries.\n==Design characteristics==\n[[Image:Akzidenz-Grotesk variations.svg|thumb|Digital variants of Akzidenz-Grotesk, showing the slight inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies between different weights and widths]]\nLike most [[sans-serif]]s, Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, with all strokes of the letter of similar width.

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces.

It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a\u2013d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.  Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes \"is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one.\"<ref>''Parmenides'' 128d</ref> Plato has [[Socrates]] claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point.<ref>''Parmenides'' 128a\u2013b</ref>\n\nSome of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]<ref name=aristotle>[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html Aristotle's ''Physics''] \"Physics\" by Aristotle translated by R.

Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. Suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed, one faster than the other. After some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say 2 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.

To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n[[Aristotle]] (384 BC\u2212322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.<ref>Aristotle.

One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.</ref>\nAristotle also distinguished \"things infinite in respect of divisibility\" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension (\"with respect to their extremities\").<ref>Aristotle.

(See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) His argument, applying the [[method of exhaustion]] to prove that the infinite sum in question is equal to the area of a particular square, is largely geometric but quite rigorous. Today's [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] achieves the same result, using [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]] (see [[convergent series]]). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.<ref name=boyer /><ref>George B.

It agrees that there can be no motion \"during\" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times.

It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a\u2013d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.

Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. Suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed, one faster than the other. After some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say 2 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.

To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n[[Aristotle]] (384 BC\u2212322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.<ref>Aristotle. Physics 6.9\n</ref>{{fv|reason=In the section cited, Aristotle says nothing about the distance decreasing |date=October 2019}}<ref>\nAristotle's observation that the fractional times also get shorter does not guarantee, in every case, that the task can be completed. One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.</ref>\nAristotle also distinguished \"things infinite in respect of divisibility\" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension (\"with respect to their extremities\").<ref>Aristotle.

(See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) His argument, applying the [[method of exhaustion]] to prove that the infinite sum in question is equal to the area of a particular square, is largely geometric but quite rigorous. Today's [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] achieves the same result, using [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]] (see [[convergent series]]). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.<ref name=boyer /><ref>George B.

It agrees that there can be no motion \"during\" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times.

However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] has Zeno saying \"it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time\". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the ''sum'', but rather with ''finishing'' a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a \"last event\"?<ref name=KBrown/><ref name=FMoorcroft/><ref name=Papa-G /><ref>{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ZenInf |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 5.

The [[Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire]], the county's foremost historical organisation, of which Myles Hildyard was long-serving president, started a Myles Thoroton Annual Lecture Series, for which he had left a bequest in his will.<ref>[http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/events/lectures_winter200708.htm The Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire, thorotonsociety.org.uk].</ref> His niece Marianna Hildyard, daughter of his brother David, is the wife of British Labour politician [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton]], whose title derives from his wife's family name.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/dec/11/1].</ref>\n\n==Works==\nHildyard's best-known works are his World War II letters, and a diary he wrote while serving as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers). His letters home and the diary from his escape were collected in a book published by Bloomsbury in 2005: ''It is Bliss Here: Letters Home, 1939\u20131945''.<ref>''It is Bliss Here'', published by Bloomsbury in England. {{ISBN|0-7475-7802-8}}.</ref>\n\nHildyard also wrote detailed histories of the Thoroton and Hildyard families, and a history of Flintham village. In 1975 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]].<ref name=\"nottingham\"/>\n\n==Reputation==\nHildyard became known in the community for his good fellowship. \"Flintham was, for the years Myles Hildyard was its guardian,\" noted ''The Independent'' in its obituary, \"a most remarkable place to visit. Not just because of the beauty and richness of its physical surroundings, but also because he himself was so remarkable a person. 'He was, in a way,' writes [[Antony Beevor]],<ref>Historian and writer Antony Beever, in the introduction to the Hildyard book published by Bloomsbury.</ref> 'the local equivalent of Nancy Mitford's Lord Merlin.' At Flintham he encouraged and received a stream of visitors young and old, who brought lively conversation, stimulation and enjoyment to a house which, when his father inherited, had been a rather forbidding and lifeless place.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/myles-hildyard-506709.html Myles Hildyard, 'Lord Merlin' of Flintham and author of a vivid account of the Second World War, Obituary, ''The Independent'', 14 September 2005]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hildyard, Myles Thoroton}}\n[[Category:1914 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:English writers]]\n[[Category:English diarists]]\n[[Category:Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry officers]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Military Cross]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:British World War II prisoners of war]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "replaced: -  \u2192  \u2013 , 1914-2005 \u2192 1914\u20132005, Captain \u2192 captain", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Thoroton_Hildyard"}

Murrow High School''' is located in the [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and is part of the [[New York City Department of Education]]. The school is known for its theater program. Its success in the arts was recognized by [[Mel Brooks]], who granted the school to be the first ever to gain rights to the musical ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' in spring 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It's a school of the arts where students are either music, dance, communication arts, theater, or art majors. The school was created under the supervision and leadership of Saul Bruckner, who was also the first principal of the school.\n\nMurrow H.S. opened in 1974 with Saul Bruckner as principal. The school was named for the pioneering broadcast journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]]. Murrow H.S. was founded according to the [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] theories of [[John Dewey]] and the learning and teaching methods of [[John Dewey High School]].  Bruckner retired in 2004 and died on May 1, 2010, in Brooklyn, New York. Anthony Lodico became Murrow's second principal. In March 2012, Lodico announced his resignation from Murrow in order to accept the High School Superintendent position. On April 2, 2012, Allen Barge assumed the role of principal of the school.\n\n==Academics==\nMurrow's academic year is divided into two semesters. Students receive new class schedules and teachers at the end of January. The daily schedule shifts depending on the day of the week, with class lengths varying from 45 minutes to an hour, and each class meets only four times a week. Rather than having a lunch period or study halls, Murrow students have free periods called \"OPTA's\" (Optional Time Activities), used for studying, eating, or relaxing.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMurrow has a number of unique{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} features including:\n* NYC High School adjusted its grade policies in 2013 so that a \"U\" is used instead of an  \"N\". The letter grading system, with each letter corresponding to a numerical measurement, e.g. E = 90-100, G = 80-89, S = 79-65, U = 65 - 55, NS = below 55 (No Show = student who never reported to class), and MI for Mastery in Independent Study.\n* In calculating the average, E is treated as a 95, G = 85, S = 75, and U = 55. This means that for getting the highest grade in all classes, a student will not achieve an average higher than 95. In college admissions applications, an explanatory letter is forwarded to colleges to explain this fact.\n* Instead of using numbers to represent class periods, Murrow uses letters from A-J, excluding I.  The periods are called \"bands\" (e.g., A-Band, D-Band). Some students take classes that meet before A-Band and after J-Band. These bands are \"0 (zero)-Band\" and \"K-Band\"\n* There are no daily \"home room\" meetings. Entering students are assigned to a \"Student Communication Section\", or SCS, and remain in that SCS until graduation. The SCS meets only on an \"as needed\" basis and is used solely for dissemination of school-wide administrative/logistical information (e.g., distribution of report cards or new class schedules; election of class officers); 2 morning bands are cut short to allow time for SCS to convene. For mandated citywide testing, students usually attend a half-day of classes, followed by the test in the SCS. \n* While many state-mandated courses (e.g., science- and math-based courses) are geared toward students of a particular class year, other elective courses (e.g., performing arts, physical education electives) are not; students taking these electives will usually find themselves in classes with students from other class years.\n\nEdward R. Murrow High School is also known for its outstanding theater program. Their success in the arts was recognized by Mel Brooks, who granted the school to be the first ever to gain rights to the smash hit musical \"The Producers\" in Spring 2008.\n\nIn attempt to diversify schools, some high schools in NYC, including Murrow, use the DOE's \"Educational Option\" model. Instead of tracking, schools admit learners of all capabilities by purposefully accepting a set percentage of students with high, middle and low test scores.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/lander-torres-breaking-cycle-school-segregation-article-1.2326463|title=How NYC can break the cycle of school segregation|last=Torres|first=Brad Lander, Ritchie|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref>\n\nThe Edward R.

Students learn all the aspects of theater including acting, technical theater, musical theater, and theater management. According to a [[New York Times]] article, student voluntarily stay after school work with theater program even on weekends and free periods. Students were painting the backdrop for the school's annual musical ''Into the Woods''. Students prepare months before the musical.

For mandated citywide testing, students usually attend a half-day of classes, followed by the test in the SCS. \n* While many state-mandated courses (e.g., science- and math-based courses) are geared toward students of a particular class year, other elective courses (e.g., performing arts, physical education electives) are not; students taking these electives will usually find themselves in classes with students from other class years.\n\nEdward R. Murrow High School is also known for its outstanding theater program. Their success in the arts was recognized by Mel Brooks, who granted the school to be the first ever to gain rights to the smash hit musical \"The Producers\" in Spring 2008.\n\nIn attempt to diversify schools, some high schools in NYC, including Murrow, use the DOE's \"Educational Option\" model. Instead of tracking, schools admit learners of all capabilities by purposefully accepting a set percentage of students with high, middle and low test scores.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/lander-torres-breaking-cycle-school-segregation-article-1.2326463|title=How NYC can break the cycle of school segregation|last=Torres|first=Brad Lander, Ritchie|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref>\n\nThe Edward R.

Students learn all the aspects of theater including acting, technical theater, musical theater, and theater management. According to a [[New York Times]] article, student voluntarily stay after school work with theater program even on weekends and free periods. Students were painting the backdrop for the school's annual musical ''Into the Woods''. Students prepare months before the musical.

She and Max's younger brother, Michael, confront Max over the wisdom of using his abilities to save Liz's life. Max becomes overburdened by guilt and decides to tell Liz who he truly is, unaware that Liz has secretly taken a DNA sample from him and analyzed it.

Kyle, having uncovered Liz's analysis, is taken to \"Project Shepherd\", a government initiative to track extraterrestrials.

Mimi gives Alex a vague warning about not ending up like Jim Valenti and his father, and mistakes Liz for Rosa, which she plays along with to gain her trust.

Alex learns from Jesse's files that Michael is an alien. With no other options, Liz turns to alien research conducted by Michael in secret, which leads her to conclude that Isobel can only be saved by using the pods to keep her in suspended animation.

Desperate, Max goes to [[Texas]] to meet Arizona, a faith healer he thinks may have alien abilities; Maria tags along hoping that Arizona can heal her mother, only to wind up shattered when Michael exposes Arizona as a [[quackery|fraud]]. Jenna asks Alex and Kyle about what she thinks is a police coverup concerning several mysterious deaths, and they reveal to her the existence of aliens. Alex subsequently restarts Project Shepherd to track a potential alien serial killer. Max confesses to Liz his guilt over not using his abilities to save more people. Later, he learns from Arizona's mother that a woman with healing powers died on her reservation around the time he arrived on Earth. Noah goes to find Max, and inadvertently discovers the pods. Kyle realizes that his father's death was covered up by Jesse. Alex decides that he wants to connect with Michael, even after realizing that he had sex with Maria.

Sheriff Valenti gives Kyle the rest of his father's letters. Isobel recovers some of her memories of Rosa, and decides to ask Liz for another dose. Maria confesses to having sex with Michael to Alex. A gunman attacks the hospital, and Noah is shot in the shoulder. Max rescues them and finds the shooter, who sets fire to Liz's laboratory; he claims that he does not remember the incident. Alex and Kyle use the piece of husk the former found to decode a secret message left by Jim Valenti, which references Caulfield, an old state prison.

They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream. This means that any \"Fedora-only\" licenses, or licenses with specific terms that Red Hat or Fedora meets but that other recipients would not are not acceptable (and almost certainly non-free, as a result).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] project that provided extra software for the [[Red Hat Linux]] distribution, and from the characteristic [[fedora]] hat used in Red Hat's \"Shadowman\" logo. Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate project at the [[University of Hawaii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=//fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Wtogami?rd=WarrenTogami|title=Warren Togami|publisher=fedoraproject.org}}</ref> intended to provide a single [[Software repository|repository]] for well-tested third-party software packages so that non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use.

Appliances are pre-installed, pre-configured, system images. This spin was intended to make it easier for anyone (developers, [[independent software vendor]]s (ISV), [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEM), etc.) to create and deploy [[virtual appliance]]s.\n\n=== Spins and Remixes ===\nThe Fedora project officially distributes different variations called \"Fedora Spins\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spins.fedoraproject.org/index.html.en|title=Fedora Spins|website=spins.fedoraproject.org}}</ref> which are Fedora with different desktop environments (GNOME is the default desktop environment). The current official spins, as of Fedora 30, are KDE, XFCE, LXQT, Mate-Compiz, Cinnamon, LXDE, and SOAS.\n\nIn addition to Spins, which are official variants of the Fedora system, the project allows unofficial variants to use the term \"Fedora Remix\" without asking for further permission, although a different logo (provided) is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix|title=Remix - Fedora Project Wiki|website=fedoraproject.org}}</ref>\n\nSome examples are \"Kannolo\", which is a Fedora KDE remix that omits anything that depends on the GTK toolkit from the default system, and [[Russian Fedora Remix]], which is a variant that ships software which is encumbered by US patent laws or would violate Fedora's policy of not including non-free software by default.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/kannolo/|title=Kannolo|website=SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n=== Architectures ===\n[[x86-32]], [[x86-64]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM-hfp]] are the primary architectures supported by Fedora.<ref name=\"Architectures\" /> Pidora<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidora.ca|title=Pidora - Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix|publisher=pidora.ca|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> and FedBerry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fedberry.org|title=FedBerry - Fedora Remix for Raspberry Pi 2/3 | publisher=fedberry.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> are specialized Fedora distributions for the [[Raspberry Pi]], which support the Raspberry Pi as well as other ARM and [[Single-board computer|SBC]] devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM#Supported_Hardware_and_Devices|title=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|access-date=}}</ref> As of release 26, Fedora also supports [[AArch64|ARM AArch64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64le]], [[Z/Architecture|IBM Z]] (\"s390x\"), [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-64el]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-el]], [[RISC-V]] as secondary architectures.\n\nFedora 28 was the last release that supported ppc64 and users are advised to move to the little endian [[ppc64le]] variant.<ref name=\"Fedora PPC64\" />\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nThe Fedora Project also distributes several other versions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alt.fedoraproject.org/|title=Fedora Alternative Downloads|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora Alternative Downloads|access-date=}}</ref> with less use cases than mentioned above, like network installers and minimal installation images. They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream. This means that any \"Fedora-only\" licenses, or licenses with specific terms that Red Hat or Fedora meets but that other recipients would not are not acceptable (and almost certainly non-free, as a result).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] project that provided extra software for the [[Red Hat Linux]] distribution, and from the characteristic [[fedora]] hat used in Red Hat's \"Shadowman\" logo. Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate project at the [[University of Hawaii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=//fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Wtogami?rd=WarrenTogami|title=Warren Togami|publisher=fedoraproject.org}}</ref> intended to provide a single [[Software repository|repository]] for well-tested third-party software packages so that non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use. The key difference between Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that Fedora's repository development would be collaborative with the global volunteer community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/31767|title=Warren Togami on the new Fedora Project|last=Barr|first=Joe|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Linux.com|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref> Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project, carrying with it this collaborative approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|title=Why Fedora?|last=Togami|first=Warren|date=February 2006|format=ODP|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831065506/http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|archive-date=31 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFedora Linux was launched in 2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued.<ref name=\"newdirection\">{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2003-September/msg00064.html | title=Fedora Project: Announcing New Direction | date=22 September 2003 | accessdate=18 October 2007 | mailinglist=Fedora development | last=Johnson | first=Michael K.}}</ref> [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was to be Red Hat's only officially supported Linux distribution, while Fedora was to be a community distribution.<ref name=\"newdirection\" /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | title=The Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, part 4 | last=Burke | first=Tim | publisher=Red Hat | series=Red Hat Magazine, Issue #22 | date=August 2006 | access-date=18 October 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012162113/http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | archive-date=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore Fedora 7, Fedora was called Fedora Core after the name of one of the two main software repositories - Core and Extras.

Fedora Extras, the secondary repository that had been included since Fedora Core 3, was community-maintained and not distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs.
