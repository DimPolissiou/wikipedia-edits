Note the thrust vectoring of the engine nozzles\n}}\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe Su-30MKI is a highly integrated [[twin tail|twin-finned]] aircraft. The airframe is constructed of [[titanium]] and high-strength [[aluminium alloy]]s. The engine [[intake ramp]]s and [[nacelle]]s are fitted with [[Aircraft fairing|trouser fairings]] to provide a continuous streamlined profile between the nacelles and the tail beams. The [[empennage|fins and horizontal tail consoles]] are attached to tail beams. The central beam section between the engine nacelles consists of the equipment compartment, fuel tank and the [[drogue parachute|brake parachute]] container. The [[fuselage]] head is of semi-[[monocoque]] construction and includes the [[cockpit]], [[radar]] compartments and the [[avionics]] bay.\n\nSu-30MKI aerodynamic configuration is a longitudinal triplane with [[relaxed stability]]. The [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] increases the aircraft [[lift (force)|lift]] ability and deflects automatically to allow high [[angle of attack]] (AoA) flights allowing it to perform [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The integral aerodynamic configuration combined with [[thrust vectoring]] results in extremely capable manoeuvrability, taking off and landing characteristics. This high agility allows rapid deployment of weapons in any direction as desired by the crew. The canard notably assists in controlling the aircraft at large angles-of-attack and bringing it to a level flight condition. The aircraft has a [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) with quadruple redundancy. Dependent on flight conditions, signals from the [[Joystick|control stick]] position transmitter or the FCS may be coupled to remote control amplifiers and combined with feedback signals from acceleration sensors and rate [[Gyroscope|gyros]]. The resultant control signals are coupled to the high-speed [[electro-hydraulic actuator]]s of the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]], [[rudder]]s and the canard. The output signals are compared and, if the difference is significant, the faulty channel is disconnected. FBW is based on a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] warning and barrier mechanism which prevents stalls through dramatic increases of control stick pressure, allowing a [[Aviator|pilot]] to effectively control the aircraft without exceeding the [[angle of attack]] and acceleration limitations. Although the maximum angle of attack is limited by the canards, the FBW acts as an additional safety mechanism.\n\nThe Su-30MKI has a range of 3,000&nbsp;km with internal fuel which ensures a 3.75&nbsp;hour combat mission. Also, it has an in-flight refueling (IFR) probe that retracts beside the cockpit during normal operation. The air refueling system increases the flight duration up to 10&nbsp;hours with a range of 8,000&nbsp;km at a cruise height of 11 to 13&nbsp;km.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Su-30MKIs can also use the Cobham 754 buddy refueling pods.<ref>[http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su30mk/lth/ \"Su-30\u041c\u041a \u2013 Aircraft performance.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144928/http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su30mk/lth/ |date=16 July 2011}} ''Sukhoi.org''.

It has direction finding capability and is known to have a programmable threat library. The RWR is derived from work done on an earlier system for India's [[MiG-23BN]]s known as the Tranquil, which is now superseded by the more advanced Tarang series. Elta EL/M-8222 a self-protection jammer developed by Israel Aircraft Industries is the MKI's standard EW pod, which the Israeli Air Force uses on its F-15s. The ELTA El/M-8222 Self Protection Pod is a power-managed jammer, air-cooled system with an ESM receiver integrated into the pod. The pod contains an antenna on the forward and aft ends, which receive the hostile RF signal and after processing deliver the appropriate response.\n\n===Propulsion===\nThe Su-30MKI is powered by two Lyulka-[[Saturn AL-31]]FP turbofans, each rated at 12,500 [[kgf]] (27,550 [[lbf]]) of full after-burning thrust, which enable speeds of up to Mach 2 in horizontal flight and a rate of climb of 230&nbsp;m/s. The mean time between overhaul is reportedly 1,000&nbsp;hours with a full-life span of 3,000&nbsp;hours; the titanium nozzle has a mean time between overhaul of 500&nbsp;hours. In early 2015, Defence Minister [[Manohar Parrikar]] stated before Parliament that the AL-31FP had suffered numerous failures, between the end of 2012 and early 2015, a total of 69 Su-30MKI engine-related failures had occurred; commons causes were [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] failures due to [[metal fatigue]] and low oil pressure, in response several engine modifications were made to improve lubrication, as well as the use of higher quality oil and adjustments to the fitting of bearings.<ref>Bedi, Rahul.

The canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently; this allows the aircraft to create thrust vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, [[Flight dynamics|pitch, yaw and roll]]. Engine thrust is adjusted via a conventional engine throttle lever as opposed to a strain-gauge engine control stick. The aircraft is controlled by a standard control stick. The pilot can activate a switch for performing difficult maneuvers; while this is enabled, the computer automatically determines the deflection angles of the swiveling nozzles and aerodynamic surfaces.<ref>Gal-Or, Benjamin (2011). \"Future Jet Technologies\".

The [[fuselage]] head is of semi-[[monocoque]] construction and includes the [[cockpit]], [[radar]] compartments and the [[avionics]] bay.\n\nSu-30MKI aerodynamic configuration is a longitudinal triplane with [[relaxed stability]]. The [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] increases the aircraft [[lift (force)|lift]] ability and deflects automatically to allow high [[angle of attack]] (AoA) flights allowing it to perform [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The integral aerodynamic configuration combined with [[thrust vectoring]] results in extremely capable manoeuvrability, taking off and landing characteristics. This high agility allows rapid deployment of weapons in any direction as desired by the crew. The canard notably assists in controlling the aircraft at large angles-of-attack and bringing it to a level flight condition. The aircraft has a [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) with quadruple redundancy. Dependent on flight conditions, signals from the [[Joystick|control stick]] position transmitter or the FCS may be coupled to remote control amplifiers and combined with feedback signals from acceleration sensors and rate [[Gyroscope|gyros]]. The resultant control signals are coupled to the high-speed [[electro-hydraulic actuator]]s of the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]], [[rudder]]s and the canard. The output signals are compared and, if the difference is significant, the faulty channel is disconnected. FBW is based on a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] warning and barrier mechanism which prevents stalls through dramatic increases of control stick pressure, allowing a [[Aviator|pilot]] to effectively control the aircraft without exceeding the [[angle of attack]] and acceleration limitations. Although the maximum angle of attack is limited by the canards, the FBW acts as an additional safety mechanism.\n\nThe Su-30MKI has a range of 3,000&nbsp;km with internal fuel which ensures a 3.75&nbsp;hour combat mission. Also, it has an in-flight refueling (IFR) probe that retracts beside the cockpit during normal operation. The air refueling system increases the flight duration up to 10&nbsp;hours with a range of 8,000&nbsp;km at a cruise height of 11 to 13&nbsp;km.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Su-30MKIs can also use the Cobham 754 buddy refueling pods.<ref>[http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su30mk/lth/ \"Su-30\u041c\u041a \u2013 Aircraft performance.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144928/http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su30mk/lth/ |date=16 July 2011}} ''Sukhoi.org''.

It has direction finding capability and is known to have a programmable threat library. The RWR is derived from work done on an earlier system for India's [[MiG-23BN]]s known as the Tranquil, which is now superseded by the more advanced Tarang series. Elta EL/M-8222 a self-protection jammer developed by Israel Aircraft Industries is the MKI's standard EW pod, which the Israeli Air Force uses on its F-15s. The ELTA El/M-8222 Self Protection Pod is a power-managed jammer, air-cooled system with an ESM receiver integrated into the pod. The pod contains an antenna on the forward and aft ends, which receive the hostile RF signal and after processing deliver the appropriate response.\n\n===Propulsion===\nThe Su-30MKI is powered by two Lyulka-[[Saturn AL-31]]FP turbofans, each rated at 12,500 [[kgf]] (27,550 [[lbf]]) of full after-burning thrust, which enable speeds of up to Mach 2 in horizontal flight and a rate of climb of 230&nbsp;m/s. The mean time between overhaul is reportedly 1,000&nbsp;hours with a full-life span of 3,000&nbsp;hours; the titanium nozzle has a mean time between overhaul of 500&nbsp;hours. In early 2015, Defence Minister [[Manohar Parrikar]] stated before Parliament that the AL-31FP had suffered numerous failures, between the end of 2012 and early 2015, a total of 69 Su-30MKI engine-related failures had occurred; commons causes were [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] failures due to [[metal fatigue]] and low oil pressure, in response several engine modifications were made to improve lubrication, as well as the use of higher quality oil and adjustments to the fitting of bearings.<ref>Bedi, Rahul.

The canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently; this allows the aircraft to create thrust vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, [[Flight dynamics|pitch, yaw and roll]]. Engine thrust is adjusted via a conventional engine throttle lever as opposed to a strain-gauge engine control stick. The aircraft is controlled by a standard control stick. The pilot can activate a switch for performing difficult maneuvers; while this is enabled, the computer automatically determines the deflection angles of the swiveling nozzles and aerodynamic surfaces.<ref>Gal-Or, Benjamin (2011). \"Future Jet Technologies\".

The College is based on the principles of [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]], a pioneer in modern education who founded the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08444a.htm St John Baptist de La Salle in Catholic Encyclopedia]</ref> Commonly known as the De La Salle Brothers in Britain, Ireland, Australasia and Asia, they are known in the United States and Canada as the Christian Brothers. They are sometimes confused with a similar congregation founded in Ireland by [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]] commonly known as known as the [[Irish Christian Brothers]].\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2019}}\nSt John's College has a history of producing soccer players over the years, some of whom have progressed to the English League system. \n*[[Des Byrne]]\n*[[Glenn Cronin]]\n*[[Joe Duffy]], broadcaster.
