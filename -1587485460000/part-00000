He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''Histor\u00edai''), a detailed record of his \"inquiry\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} [[History#Etymology|''histor\u00eda'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as \"[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]]\", a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC [[Roman Empire|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]].<ref>T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nDespite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes many obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. However, Herodotus states that he is merely reporting what he has seen and been told, on several occasions saying that he does not himself believe the story that he reports. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.\n\n==Place in history==\nHerodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories:''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''.

Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus' work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history\",<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as \"Heliopolitans\" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>\n\nBut Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name=\"OswynMurray\" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904\u2013920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181\u2013182, n. 904\u2013920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary and modern critics===\nIt is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics have branded him \"The Father of Lies\".<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\">{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=16 November 2009|author=David Pipes}}</ref> Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|\nHerodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

Taylor and Francis. p.&nbsp;174</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] dismissed Herodotus as a \"logos-writer\" (story-teller).<ref name=\"OswynMurray_a\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=191}}</ref> Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.<ref>Waterfield, Robin (trans.) and Dewald, Carolyn (ed.). (1998). ''The Histories by Herodotus''. University of Oxford Press. \u201cIntroduction\u201d, p.&nbsp;xviii</ref> Moreover, Thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the Greek world-view: focused on the context of the ''[[polis]]'' or city-state.

His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&nbsp;BC. \n\nThe epic poet [[Panyassis]] \u2013 a relative of Herodotus \u2013 is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. \n\nThe ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454&nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] \u2013 a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u201355), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium\", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces\". These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable\", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p.&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade \u2013 by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p.&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, \"Your son's soul yearns for knowledge.\"\n\nEventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''in Vita. Thucyd.'' p.&nbsp;ix, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref> According to the ''Suda'', he was buried in Macedonian [[Pella]] and in the [[agora]] in [[Thurium]].<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==Reliability==\n[[File:Dedication page for the Historiae by Herodotus printed at Venice 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dedication]] in the ''Histories'', translated into Latin by [[Lorenzo Valla]], Venice 1494]]\n''The Histories'' were occasionally criticized in antiquity,{{efn|See [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in ''Verae Historiae''.}} but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=189}}</ref> Despite the controversy,<ref>{{harvp|Mikalson|2003|pp=198\u2013200}}</ref>{{efn|Some regard his works as being at least partly unreliable.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they \"saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards\", although, being unaware of the existence of the southern hemisphere, he says that he does not believe the claim. Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/ |title=Herodotus on the First Circumnavigation of Africa |year=1996 |access-date=12 June 2019 |work=[[Livius.org]]}}\n</ref> His accounts of India are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_307.gif |title=The Indian Empire |work=[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]] |year=1909 |volume=2 |page=272 |via=[[Digital South Asia Library]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Jain\">{{cite book |last=Jain |first=Meenakshi |title=The India They Saw: Foreign Accounts |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=[[Prabhat Prakashan]] |location=Delhi |isbn=978-81-8430-106-9 |volume=1-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlMkBQAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |year=1981 |title=The Classical Accounts of India: Being a Compilation of the English Translations of the Accounts Left by Herodotus, Megasthenes, Arrian, Strabo, Quintus, Diodorus, Siculus, Justin, Plutarch, Frontinus, Nearchus, Apollonius, Pliny, Ptolemy, Aelian, and Others with Maps |location=Calcutta |publisher=Firma KLM |pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicalaccounts/page/n523 504] |url=https://archive.org/details/classicalaccounts |oclc=247581880}}</ref>\n\nDiscoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to Herodotus's credibility. He described [[Gelonus]], located in [[Scythia]], as a city thousands of times larger than [[Troy]]; this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975. The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called \"Naucratis stela\" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]].\n[[File:Claude Vignon - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.jpg|thumb|left|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]\n\nAfter journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\">{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}</ref> In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry \"[[ant]]s\" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant\". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Marlise |last=Simons |author-link=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |access-date=23 February 2016 |page=5 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the \"ants\" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.\n\n===Accusations of bias===\nSome \"calumnious fictions\" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case \"a great collector of slanders\"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom ''Orat. xxxvii, p11 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 an account also given by [[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]] in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''</ref> In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece. As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states \u2013 [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and Corinth in particular.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=8, 9, 32\u201334}}</ref>\n\n''The Histories'' were sometimes criticized in antiquity,{{efn|For example, they were criticized for inaccuracy by [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who attacked Herodotus as a liar in ''Verae Historiae'' and went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the [[Fortunate Isles|Island of the Blessed]]}} but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of Herodotus's methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology\",<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography\",<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history\".<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9\u201316.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality\". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.

He is known for having written the book ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 ''Histor\u00edai''), a detailed record of his \"inquiry\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} [[History#Etymology|''histor\u00eda'']]) on the origins of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He is widely considered to have been the first writer to have treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation\u2014specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an [[historiographic]] narrative. On account of this, he is often referred to as \"[[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field#Social sciences|The Father of History]]\", a title first conferred on him by the first-century BC [[Roman Empire|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]].<ref>T. James Luce, ''The Greek Historians'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o7aHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 p. 26].</ref>\n\nDespite Herodotus's historical significance, little is known about his personal life. His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information. Herodotus has been criticized for the fact that his book includes many obvious legends and fanciful accounts. Many authors, starting with the late fifth-century BC historian [[Thucydides]], have accused him of making up stories for entertainment. However, Herodotus states that he is merely reporting what he has seen and been told, on several occasions saying that he does not himself believe the story that he reports. A sizable portion of the information he provides has since been confirmed by historians and archaeologists.\n\n==Place in history==\nHerodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories:''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''. The original title can be translated from the Greek as \"researches\" or \"inquiries\".<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/herodotus \"Herodotus\"] ''Encyclopedia of World Biography.'' The Gale Group. Retrieved March 11, 2018.</ref>}}\n\n{{quotation|Here are presented the results of the enquiry carried out by Herodotus of Halicarnassus. The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks.|Herodotus, ''The Histories''<br>\nRobin Waterfield translation (2008)}}\n\n===Predecessors===\nHis record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. Herodotus's place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and na\u00efve, often charming \u2013 all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>\n\nModern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus's works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=27}}</ref> but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories''.\n\n===Writing style===\nIn his introduction to Hecataeus' work, ''Genealogies'':\n[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires.jpg|thumb|upright=0.86|Fragment from the ''Histories''&nbsp;VIII on [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus]] 2099, early 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD]]\n{{quotation|Hecataeus the Milesian speaks thus: I write these things as they seem true to me; for the stories told by the Greeks are various and in my opinion absurd.}}\n\nThis points forward to the \"folksy\" yet \"international\" outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as \"a curious false start to history\",<ref name=\"OswynMurray\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=188}}</ref> since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth.

For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Histories''&nbsp;4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the [[Danube]] and [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=430}}</ref>\n\nHis debt to previous authors of prose \"histories\" might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904\u2013920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181\u2013182, n. 904\u2013920</ref>\n\n[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|\u201cIn the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.\u201d<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels.

In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:\n{{quotation|\nHerodotus the son of Sphynx <br>\nlies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>\na Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>\nand made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nYet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes \u2013 a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A.

His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&nbsp;BC. \n\nThe epic poet [[Panyassis]] \u2013 a relative of Herodotus \u2013 is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of [[Samos]] (III,&nbsp;39\u201360), and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.\n\n[[File:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]\n\nHerodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect, yet he was born in Halicarnassus, which was a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement. According to the ''Suda'', Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. \n\nThe ''Suda'' also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=11}}</ref>\n\n===Early travels===\nAs Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,&nbsp;144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,&nbsp;178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.\n\nHerodotus's eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454&nbsp;BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460\u2013454&nbsp;BC. He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447&nbsp;BC, migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] \u2013 a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admires (V,&nbsp;78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI,&nbsp;137; VIII,&nbsp;52\u201355), as well as leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing.\n\nAccording to [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius ''Chron. Can. Pars.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;339, 01.83.4, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> and [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch ''De Malign. Herod.''&nbsp;II p.&nbsp;862&nbsp;A, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. It is possible that he unsuccessfully applied for Athenian citizenship, a rare honour after 451&nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly.\n\n===Later life===\nIn 443&nbsp;BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. [[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by \"Herodotus of Thurium\", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127). Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,&nbsp;91; VII,&nbsp;133, 233; IX,&nbsp;73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. Possibly he died in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurium. There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated to later than 430&nbsp;BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.\n\n===Author and orator===\nHerodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of ''The Histories'' that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus's work which could be labeled as \"performance pieces\". These portions of the research seem independent and \"almost detachable\", so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th&nbsp;century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Histories|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = xii|others = Introduction and Notes by John Marincola; Trans. by Aubrey de Selincourt}}</ref>\n\nIt was conventional in Herodotus's day for authors to \"publish\" their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to [[Lucian]], Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire ''Histories'' to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian,<ref>Montfaucon\u2019s ''Bibliothec. Coisl. Cod.''&nbsp;clxxvii p.&nbsp;609, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=14}}</ref> Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade \u2013 by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression \"Herodotus and his shade\" to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus's recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the ''Suda'': that of [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Photius]]<ref>Photius ''Bibliothec. Cod.''&nbsp;lx p.&nbsp;59, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> and [[Tzetzes]],<ref>Tzetzes ''Chil.''&nbsp;1.19, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=15}}</ref> in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, \"Your son's soul yearns for knowledge.\"\n\nEventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''in Vita. Thucyd.'' p.&nbsp;ix, cited by {{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref> According to the ''Suda'', he was buried in Macedonian [[Pella]] and in the [[agora]] in [[Thurium]].<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==Reliability==\n[[File:Dedication page for the Historiae by Herodotus printed at Venice 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dedication]] in the ''Histories'', translated into Latin by [[Lorenzo Valla]], Venice 1494]]\n''The Histories'' were occasionally criticized in antiquity,{{efn|See [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in ''Verae Historiae''.}} but modern historians and philosophers generally take a positive view.<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=189}}</ref> Despite the controversy,<ref>{{harvp|Mikalson|2003|pp=198\u2013200}}</ref>{{efn|Some regard his works as being at least partly unreliable.

The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called \"Naucratis stela\" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]].\n[[File:Claude Vignon - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.jpg|thumb|left|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]\n\nAfter journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\">{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}</ref> In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry \"[[ant]]s\" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] \u2013 the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] \u2013 that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows. Later authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. [[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for \"marmot\" with the word for \"mountain ant\". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.<ref name=\"Peissel Ants\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Marlise |last=Simons |author-link=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |access-date=23 February 2016 |page=5 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the \"ants\" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.\n\n===Accusations of bias===\nSome \"calumnious fictions\" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case \"a great collector of slanders\"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom ''Orat. xxxvii, p11 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 an account also given by [[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]] in his ''Life of Thucydides''.<ref>Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''</ref> In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece. As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states \u2013 [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and Corinth in particular.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=8, 9, 32\u201334}}</ref>\n\n''The Histories'' were sometimes criticized in antiquity,{{efn|For example, they were criticized for inaccuracy by [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who attacked Herodotus as a liar in ''Verae Historiae'' and went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the [[Fortunate Isles|Island of the Blessed]]}} but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of Herodotus's methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources,<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989}}</ref> yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered \"father of comparative anthropology\",<ref name=\"BurnHerodotus\" /> \"the father of ethnography\",<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and \"more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history\".<ref name=\"OswynMurray_b\"/>\n\n=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===\nIt is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that \"Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being ''philobarbaros'', a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.\"<ref>{{harvp|Waters|1985|p=3}}</ref>\n\nHerodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io.<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=pp. 5\u20136, \u00a71.1, 1.5}}</ref> However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: \"I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man ''who I know for a fact'' began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 6, \u00a71.5}}</ref> Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: \"I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 9, \u00a71.20}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states \"[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, ''but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 12, \u00a71.29}}</ref> Again, in the story about Croesus and his son's death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus' son), Herodotus states: \"Adrastus ... ''believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known'', cut his own throat over the grave.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|loc=p. 17, \u00a71.45, \u00b62}}</ref>\n\n== Mode of explanation ==\nHerodotus writes with the purpose of ''explaining''; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: \"This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''.\"<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThis mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:\n\n:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''\n:''Apollo,''\n:''Zeus\u2019 son and Leto\u2019s, offended''\n:''by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored''\n:''Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god''\n:''struck the Greek camp with plague,''\n:''and the soldiers were dying of it.''<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', trans. Stanley Lombardo (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company'','' 1997): 1, Bk. 1, lines 9\u201316.</ref>\n\nBoth Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer's case, \"who set these two at each other's throats?\" In Herodotus's case, \"Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?\"\n\nHerodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that \"the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=65}}</ref>\n\nSome readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of causality ===\nHerodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from [[Homer]] onward.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=67\u201370}}</ref> Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question \"why did this happen?\" but rather \"why did this happen to me?\" By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>\n\nSome authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that \"this is how it had to be,\" is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event \"was going to happen\" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of \"it was going to happen\" reveals a \"tragic discovery\" associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' as well.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n\nJohn Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a \"philosophy of history\" or \"simple causality\". Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76\u201378}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77\u201378}}</ref>}}\n\n==Herodotus and myth==\nAlthough Herodotus considered his \"inquiries\" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that \"many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man\" (IX, 100).\n\nIn Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, \"second to no man living at that time,\" who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that \"a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,\" and alleges its veracity by adding that the \"Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.\" Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.<ref>''Histories'' 1.23\u201324.</ref>\n\nHerodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus's dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought \u2013 Herodotus as centaur:\n\n{{blockquote|The human forepart of the animal ... is the urbane and responsible classical historian; the body indissolubly united to it is something out of the faraway mountains, out of an older, freer and wilder realm where our conventions have no force.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=8}}</ref>}}\n\nHerodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales \u2013 he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual.<ref>{{harvp|Romm|1998|p=6}}</ref> For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|\n* [[Histories (Herodotus)]]\n* [[Historiography]] (the history of history and historians)\n* [[Thucydides]], ancient Greek historian who is also often said to be \"the father of history\"\n* [[Strabo]]\n* ''[[Geographica]]''\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''\n* [[Padaei|The Padaei]]\n* [[Pseudo-Herodotus]]\n* [[Sostratos of Aegina]]\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae#Sources|Battle of Thermopylae: Herodotus and other Sources]]\n* [[The Herodotus Machine]]\n}}\n\n==Critical editions==\n* C.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the second film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Louis Leterrier]] from a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]], and stars [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] alongside [[Liv Tyler]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Ty Burrell]], and [[William Hurt]]. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the [[Weapon Plus|\"Super-Soldier\" program]] through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character though Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' for Marvel, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|1978 television series of the same name]]. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, distancing it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from July to November 2007, primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], with additional filming in [[New York City]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of [[motion capture]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] to complete the film.\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]], on June 8, 2008, and was released in the United States on June 13, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It was widely considered to be an improvement over the 2003 film, with praise for its visuals, action sequences, and portrayal of the title character. The film grossed $264.8 million worldwide, making it the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Reception|lowest-grossing film]] of the MCU. Norton disputed with Marvel over the final edit of the film and chose not to promote it. He was replaced in the role of Banner by [[Mark Ruffalo]] for future MCU films starting with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] meets with Dr. [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment\u2014part of a [[World War II]]-era [[Weapon Plus|\"super soldier\" program]] that Ross hopes to recreate\u2014fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the [[Hulk]] for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.\n\nFive years later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed.<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the former of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he anonymously collaborates with a colleague known only as \"Mr. Blue\". He is learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, which is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross' forces and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]], who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nA recovered Blonsky joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. In his new monstrous form, Blonsky rampages through [[Harlem]].\n\nRealizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a battle throughout Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea, and leaves Blonsky for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of suppressing his transformation, he begins to transform in a controlled manner with a slight smirk. [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him that a team{{refn|group=N|Identified offscreen as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].}} is being put together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]: <!-- Do NOT put \"/ Hulk\" here -- unless there's a reliable source which states he voiced the character. --> <br />A [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and [[biochemist]] at Culver University who, because of exposure to [[gamma radiation]], transforms into an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated. [[David Duchovny]] was a front-runner for the film before Norton's casting,<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> while Louis Leterrier's original choice for the role was [[Mark Ruffalo]], who would later play Banner in future [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films.<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who played Banner in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|TV series]].<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> \"Edward's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas,\" Leterrier said. \"Admittedly I'm not the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]].\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" />\n** [[Lou Ferrigno]] provides vocal performance as the [[Hulk]]. During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> This marks the third time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk, having also voiced the character in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|1996 animated series]]. Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added \"Leave me alone!\" and \"Hulk smash!\" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name=\"IGNDirectorSpeaks\" /> Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" />\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as [[Betty Ross]]: <br />A [[cellular biology|cellular biologist]] and Bruce's former girlfriend, from whom he is separated as a result of his condition. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script and was a fan of the TV show because of the \"humanity and what [Banner] is going through\".<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> She was called about the role while driving to her home and she accepted the part after a day without reading the script.<ref name=\"TylerTimes\" /> Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> She said filming the part \"was very physical, which was fun\",<ref name=\"TylerUSAToday\" /> and compared her performance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\", because of Betty's shock at Bruce's unexpected return into her life.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky / Abomination]]: <br />A Russian-born officer in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines Commandos]] loaned to Ross who, lusting for the Hulk's power, is injected with various serums that transforms him into a near-skeletal humanoid monster more powerful than the Hulk himself. Roth said he took the part to please his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas \"very dark and very interesting\". Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality, and to compare himself to it.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> It was Roth who suggested Blonsky be a soldier, whereas in the comics he was a [[KGB]] agent.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Leterrier was a fan of Roth's work, and felt \"it's great watching a normal [[Cockney]] boy become a superhero!\",<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> Before he was cast in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] was in discussions for the role.<ref name=\"RayStevenson\" /> Roth prepared for the part by learning to fire guns and break into rooms with two experts.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Roth found it tough shooting the chases, because to show Blonsky's aging he could not work out.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness, which was used to show the injected Blonsky's 30\u201340 mile per hour running abilities.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> [[Cyril Raffaelli]] performed some of Roth's stunts.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Roth enjoyed the [[motion capture]], which reminded him of [[fringe theatre]], and he hired his trainer from ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]: The cellular biologist who develops a possible antidote to Banner's condition.

Burrell had performed with Norton in the [[off Broadway]] play ''[[Burn This]]'' in 2003, and when Leterrier met him, he recognized Burrell as the \"jerk\" from the 2004 ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' remake,<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> which was how Samson was characterized in the script before Norton rewrote it.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]]: <br />Betty's father and a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|general]] who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk. Leterrier cast Hurt because \"Ross is more physical, more explosive in this movie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William.\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> He compared Ross to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]].<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The Hulk is Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the character. Hurt found production very different from the typical \"pure anxiety\" of a studio film, finding it more akin to an independent film.<ref name=\"HurtMTV\" /> He described Ross as \"humiliated by Hulk's conscience: he actually sees and recognizes that it's more developed than his own, even though he's a patriot and a warrior for his country. He's sacrificed [much] for that purpose, but at the expense at times of his humanity \u2013 which he occasionally recovers.\"<ref name=\"HurtCalgary\" /> In June 2015, when reflecting on how his reprisal in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' was different from this film, Hurt said, \"What I created [for ''The Incredible Hulk''] was a Ross who was right out of the graphic novel type of thing, where he was as much of a cartoon, in a way, as the monsters were. His ego was just as big and his problems were just as big. I really did do that consciously. I created a General Ross before which created a verisimilitude for the monsters, by making him a human monster. I worked really hard on the makeup and the exaggerated behavior and things like that and a controlled psychosis.\"<ref name=\"HurtLATimesJune2015\" /> [[Sam Elliott]] had expressed interest in reprising the role from the first ''Hulk'' film.<ref name=\"ElliottMTV\" />\n\n[[Robert Downey Jr.]] has an uncredited cameo as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a favor to [[Marvel Studios]], which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production.<ref name=\"DowneyCameo\" /> Hulk co-creator [[Stan Lee]] cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. [[Michael K. Williams]] appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"MichaelKWilliams\" /> [[Paul Soles]], who voiced Banner in the 1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' animated series, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. [[Rickson Gracie]] has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor; despite Gracie's [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] background, he is credited as an [[Aikido]] instructor. Brazilian actress [[D\u00e9bora Nascimento]] makes a cameo as Martina, Banner's colleague at a beverage factory. [[Peter Mensah]] plays a small role as General Joe Gellar, one of General Ross' military friends/associates. Christina Cabot portrays Major Kathleen Sparr, General Ross' personal aid.<ref name=\"ChristinaCabot\" /> Hulk supporting characters, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] and Jack McGee, make cameo appearances as Culver University students played by P.J.

[[Jon Favreau]] had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier's primary inspiration was [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]'s ''Hulk: Gray'' (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,<ref name=\"IGNJuly2006\" /> while Feige added the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself\".<ref name=\"FeigeWish\" /> Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".<ref name=\"May2006Empire\" />\n\n[[Zak Penn]], who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996, said the film would follow up ''Hulk'', but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' [[Hulk#Bibliography|run on the comic]]. He compared his script to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which was a very different film from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', but still in the same continuity.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film ''[[The Grand (film)|The Grand]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand.<ref name=\"TimesSquare\" /> Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> Feige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made ''Incredible Hulk'' was to get Hulk into the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> canon.\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGNApr2014\" />\n\nShortly after the release of ''The Incredible Hulk'', Gale Anne Hurd commented on the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' film. \"We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"reboot\" and \"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderHurdInt\" /> Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> \"Audiences know this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> The new origin story references [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.<ref name=\"ScifiWeekly\" /> Norton removed [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and toned down [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s presence.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns,<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> which references Bruce Jones' story.<ref name=\"ColliderFeige\" /> Norton rewrote scenes every day.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> Ultimately, the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided to credit the script solely to Penn,<ref name=\"PennSoleCredit\" /> who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]] explained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue.\"<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with [Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"<ref name=\"PennUnhappy\" /> Before either Penn or Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" />\n\n===Filming===\nLeterrier had to direct four [[second unit|units]] with a broken foot.<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place in [[Toronto]], because mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing [[Yonge Street]] for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Morningside Park (Toronto)|Morningside Park]]. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> There was also shooting in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> A factory in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], which was due for demolition, was the interior of the Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a [[backlot]] in Hamilton.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Other Canadian locations included [[CFB Trenton]] and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [[New York City]] and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"FilmingCFB\" /> While there, the crew shot at [[Rocinha]], [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], [[Tijuca Forest]] and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]]. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut [[carbon emissions]] and waste created during filming.<ref name=\"TorontoStar\" /> Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself is an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced [[pinus echinata|yellow pine]] instead of [[Decorative plywood|lauan]] for the sets, and also used zero-or low-[[Volatile Organic Compounds|VOC]] paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' became the first blockbuster film to receive the [[Environmental Media Association]]'s Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.<ref name=\"EMAGreenSeal\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Editing====\nSeventy minutes of footage, mostly dealing with the origin, were not included in the final cut.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Editor [[Kyle Cooper]], creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to ''Hulk'', had resulted in compressing these to the film's start.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the [[Arctic]] to commit [[suicide]]. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n\nNorton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton \"made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product\".<ref name=\"NYTimesRuntime\" /> Norton dismissed this: \"Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them.\"<ref name=\"EWbtsDrama\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:MovieAbomination.jpg|thumb|Leterrier's finished redesign of the Abomination]]\nLeterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard he was aiming for.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effects company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" /> Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an [[\u00fcber]]-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones, creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> The character also shares Roth's tattoos.<ref name=\"RothMTV\" /> A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II#Match|example]] of [[Mike Tyson]] when he fought [[Evander Holyfield]]), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.<ref name=\"AbombEars\" />\n\nLeterrier had planned to use [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[animatronic]]s to complement the [[computer-generated imagery]] that was solely used in the previous film.<ref name=\"Animatronic\" /> The make-up artists who worked on ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation,<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them].\"<ref name=\"PennBlonsky\" /> Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films since ''[[Alien 3]]'') was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic.<ref name=\"Woodruff\" /> An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and [[dry ice]] for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Incredible Hulk (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nThe score for the film was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], who was the [[arrangement|arranger]] for [[Massive Attack]], a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed]]''. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'').<ref name=\"MusicEye\" /> At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.<ref name=\"MusicHidden\" /> The film's score borrows [[Joe Harnell]]'s theme \"The Lonely Man\" from the 1978 ''Incredible Hulk'' television series.<ref name=harnell>{{cite web |url= http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |title= The Incredible Hulk: Music From the Television Pilot Movies |website= joeharnell.com |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141229232212/http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |archivedate= December 29, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Louis-Leterrier-Incroyable-Hulk-2.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Louis Leterrier]] promoting the film in [[Paris]] in July 2008]]\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"We know the Hulk from 2003 didn't satisfy the fans, and we had to acknowledge that.

Norton attended the premiere, took part in a ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' sketch and would also promote the film in Japan.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> However, during the film's release he chose to do charity work in Africa.<ref name=\"NortonAfrica\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered on June 8, 2008 at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]]<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> and was released in theaters on June 13 in the United States,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> where it opened in 3,505 theaters.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> The film is part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseOne\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' was formatted and screened in [[IMAX]] for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10 year anniversary IMAX festival.<ref name=\"IMAX10thAnniversaryFestival\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' was released by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on October 21, 2008. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening.<ref name=\"DVDDetails\" /><ref name=\"BRDDetails\" /> The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2008, in the United States (having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13). There are widescreen and fullscreen single-disc editions; a three-disc special edition; and a two-disc Blu-ray package. The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth, while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes, and the third with a [[Digital Copy|digital copy]] of the film. The Blu-ray edition combines the content of the first two DVDs onto a single disc, while the second disc contains the digital copy.\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"BriefcaseSet\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"BriefcaseDelayed\" /> Universal released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on April 10, 2018.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $134.8 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $128.6 million from other territories, for a worldwide total of $263.4 million.<ref name=\"BOMIncredibleHulk\" /> The film, even though it barely passed its predecessor, and only equalled it if the smaller budget of the first film is taken into account, was still considered successful. Entertainment analyst David Davis told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', \"The first Hulk had such high expectations after the [[NBC Universal]] merger and was supposed to be critical favorite Ang Lee's breakout commercial blockbuster. Then with the new Hulk film, Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of ''Iron Man'' this summer. So the new one overdelivered, relative to its underpromise.\"<ref name=\"THRBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend, becoming the top film at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> Behind ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', it was the second-highest gross for a film released over the [[Father's Day]] weekend.<ref name=\"VarietyBO\" /> This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed [[word of mouth]] would contribute to the film breaking even eventually.<ref name=\"LATimesBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' also opened in 38 other countries, adding $31 million to the total opening. The film outgrossed the 2003 film in South Korea, while its openings in [[Mexico]] and Russia created records for Universal.<ref name=\"VarietyOverseasBO\" /> The film grossed 24 million [[Renminbi|yuan]] (roughly $3.4 million) in its Chinese opening on August 26, outgrossing the previous film's overall gross of 10 million yuan.<ref name=\"ChineseBO\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 67% approval rating with an average score of 6.17/10 based on 231 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' may not be quite the smashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it offers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Incredible Hulk (2008)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_incredible_hulk/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> A [[CinemaScore]] poll indicated the majority of viewers were male and graded the film an A-, and 82% of them had seen the 2003 film.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" />\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in ''The Incredible Hulk''.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\" and \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three\u2014actually six\u2014hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements.\"<ref name=\"McCarthyReview\" /> Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' applauded that the film \"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's ''Hulk'' didn't: it's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity\".<ref name=\"RodriguezReview\" /> Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> [[Lou Lumenick]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, \"What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang] Lee took\".<ref name=\"LumenickReview\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] was not a fan of the film stating, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" />\n\nConversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" /> [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, \"'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".<ref name=\"ScottReview\" /> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns\".<ref name=\"AnsenReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award association\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" | 2008\n| [[2008 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]\n| Choice Summer Movie: Action\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[National Movie Awards]]\n| Best Superhero\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"NationalMovieAwards\" />\n|-\n| Best Performance \u2013 Male\n| Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\"|[[2008 Scream Awards|Scream Awards]]\n| Best Fantasy Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"6\"|<ref name=\"ScreamAwards\" /> \n|-\n| Best Fantasy Actor\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Superhero\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Remake\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Line\n| \"Hulk Smash\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Comic Book Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 2009\n| [[35th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]]\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"SaturnAwards\" />\n|}\n\n==Future==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\nOf a potential sequel, Norton said, \"The whole thing was to envision it in multiple parts.

Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on,<ref name=\"NortonNotSigned\" /> but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel,<ref name=\"VarietyOutperform\" /> though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return.<ref name=\"LeterrierDH\" /> Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover.<ref name=\"MTVFeigeHulkAgain\" /> Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series, the second and third film of which had a 12-year gap.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more films.<ref name=\"RothSequels\" /> Leterrier, after having previously said he did not want to direct a sequel,<ref name=\"LeterrierNo\" /> said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.<ref name=\"LeterrierYes\" />\n\n[[Mark Ruffalo]] (Leterrier's first choice before casting Norton<ref name=\"HuffPost\" />) began his role as Banner / Hulk in ''The Avengers'', after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name=\"NortonReplaced\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRuffalo\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" /> In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to [[Collider (website)|Collider]] that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.<ref name=\"April2012NoSequel\" /> In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"SequelPossible\" /> In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" and \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storylines, stated, \"everything [in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" /> In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> films\".<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> Marvel regained the film production rights for the character since February 2006,<ref name=\"HulkRightsFeb2006\" /> but Universal retained the distribution rights for ''The Incredible Hulk'' as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to pick up the distribution rights to each of any future Marvel-produced Hulk films.<ref name=\"HulkRights\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We\u2019ve worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\nMCU director [[James Gunn]] expressed interest in doing a film featuring both Hulk and Red Hulk, but the project never entered development due to conflicts with Universal.<ref name=\"GunnRedHulk\" /> At the 2019 D23 Expo, Marvel Studios confirmed that a series centered around [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk]] is in development for exclusive release on [[Disney+]]. The miniseries will revolve around Bruce Banner's cousin, who gains superpowers after receiving a blood transfusion from him.<ref name=\"SheHulk\" /> By April 2020, Ruffalo was in talks to appear in ''[[She-Hulk (TV series)|She-Hulk]]''. He also hoped a solo Hulk film could still happen, and have it centered on the character's life between his other film appearances \"to fill in all the blanks about what happened to him\".<ref name=\"RuffaloApr2020Variety\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\">''Anatomy of a Hulk-out'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\">''Becoming the Hulk'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\">[[Louis Leterrier]] and [[Tim Roth]]'s [[audio commentary]], 2008 DVD</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\">''Becoming the Abomination'', 2008 DVD featurette</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DVDMaking\">''The Making of Incredible'', 2008 DVD documentary</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BRDPicture\">''Picture in Picture'', 2008 [[Blu-ray Disc]] feature</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"May2006Empire\">{{Cite news |title=Make Ours Marvel |date=May 26, 2006 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |page=66}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"April2008Empire\">{{Cite news |title=News Etc. |date=April 2008 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |pages=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"June2008Empire\">{{Cite news |title=Fight Club <!-- yes, they were joking--> |last=de Semlyen |first=Nick |date=June 2008 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |pages=66\u201372}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AradMay2005\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.mania.com/arad-talks-bispiderman-2ib-bihulk-2ib_article_87918.html |title=Arad Talks ''Spider-Man 2'', ''Hulk 2'' |last=Worley |first=Rob |date=March 22, 2002 |access-date=June 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EdkuDWVf?url=http://www.mania.com/arad-talks-bispiderman-2ib-bihulk-2ib_article_87918.html |archive-date=February 23, 2013 |publisher=Mania.com |author-link=Rob Worley}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\">{{Cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-06-18-hulk_x.htm |title=Busting out: 'Hulk' stars aglow for the premiere |last=Keck |first=William |date=June 18, 2003 |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=August 18, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Edkf9up3?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2003-06-18-hulk_x.htm |archive-date=February 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/22216 |title=Hulk 2-story BS!

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the second film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Louis Leterrier]] from a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]], and stars [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] alongside [[Liv Tyler]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Ty Burrell]], and [[William Hurt]]. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the [[Weapon Plus|\"Super-Soldier\" program]] through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character though Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' for Marvel, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|1978 television series of the same name]]. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, distancing it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from July to November 2007, primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], with additional filming in [[New York City]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of [[motion capture]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] to complete the film.\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]], on June 8, 2008, and was released in the United States on June 13, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It was widely considered to be an improvement over the 2003 film, with praise for its visuals, action sequences, and portrayal of the title character. The film grossed $264.8 million worldwide, making it the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Reception|lowest-grossing film]] of the MCU. Norton disputed with Marvel over the final edit of the film and chose not to promote it. He was replaced in the role of Banner by [[Mark Ruffalo]] for future MCU films starting with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] meets with Dr. [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment\u2014part of a [[World War II]]-era [[Weapon Plus|\"super soldier\" program]] that Ross hopes to recreate\u2014fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the [[Hulk]] for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.\n\nFive years later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed.<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the former of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he anonymously collaborates with a colleague known only as \"Mr. Blue\". He is learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, which is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross' forces and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]], who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nA recovered Blonsky joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. In his new monstrous form, Blonsky rampages through [[Harlem]].\n\nRealizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a battle throughout Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea, and leaves Blonsky for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of suppressing his transformation, he begins to transform in a controlled manner with a slight smirk. [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him that a team{{refn|group=N|Identified offscreen as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].}} is being put together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]: <!-- Do NOT put \"/ Hulk\" here -- unless there's a reliable source which states he voiced the character. --> <br />A [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and [[biochemist]] at Culver University who, because of exposure to [[gamma radiation]], transforms into an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated. [[David Duchovny]] was a front-runner for the film before Norton's casting,<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> while Louis Leterrier's original choice for the role was [[Mark Ruffalo]], who would later play Banner in future [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films.<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who played Banner in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|TV series]].<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> \"Edward's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas,\" Leterrier said. \"Admittedly I'm not the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]].\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" />\n** [[Lou Ferrigno]] provides vocal performance as the [[Hulk]]. During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> This marks the third time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk, having also voiced the character in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|1996 animated series]]. Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added \"Leave me alone!\" and \"Hulk smash!\" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name=\"IGNDirectorSpeaks\" /> Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" />\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as [[Betty Ross]]: <br />A [[cellular biology|cellular biologist]] and Bruce's former girlfriend, from whom he is separated as a result of his condition. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script and was a fan of the TV show because of the \"humanity and what [Banner] is going through\".<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> She was called about the role while driving to her home and she accepted the part after a day without reading the script.<ref name=\"TylerTimes\" /> Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> She said filming the part \"was very physical, which was fun\",<ref name=\"TylerUSAToday\" /> and compared her performance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\", because of Betty's shock at Bruce's unexpected return into her life.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky / Abomination]]: <br />A Russian-born officer in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines Commandos]] loaned to Ross who, lusting for the Hulk's power, is injected with various serums that transforms him into a near-skeletal humanoid monster more powerful than the Hulk himself. Roth said he took the part to please his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas \"very dark and very interesting\". Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality, and to compare himself to it.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> It was Roth who suggested Blonsky be a soldier, whereas in the comics he was a [[KGB]] agent.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Leterrier was a fan of Roth's work, and felt \"it's great watching a normal [[Cockney]] boy become a superhero!\",<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> Before he was cast in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] was in discussions for the role.<ref name=\"RayStevenson\" /> Roth prepared for the part by learning to fire guns and break into rooms with two experts.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Roth found it tough shooting the chases, because to show Blonsky's aging he could not work out.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness, which was used to show the injected Blonsky's 30\u201340 mile per hour running abilities.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> [[Cyril Raffaelli]] performed some of Roth's stunts.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Roth enjoyed the [[motion capture]], which reminded him of [[fringe theatre]], and he hired his trainer from ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]: The cellular biologist who develops a possible antidote to Banner's condition. Towards the end of the film, Sterns is exposed to some substance that begins his transformation into [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]]: <br />A psychiatrist who is in a relationship with Betty during Bruce's absence. Burrell had performed with Norton in the [[off Broadway]] play ''[[Burn This]]'' in 2003, and when Leterrier met him, he recognized Burrell as the \"jerk\" from the 2004 ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' remake,<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> which was how Samson was characterized in the script before Norton rewrote it.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]]: <br />Betty's father and a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|general]] who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk. Leterrier cast Hurt because \"Ross is more physical, more explosive in this movie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William.\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> He compared Ross to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]].<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The Hulk is Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the character. Hurt found production very different from the typical \"pure anxiety\" of a studio film, finding it more akin to an independent film.<ref name=\"HurtMTV\" /> He described Ross as \"humiliated by Hulk's conscience: he actually sees and recognizes that it's more developed than his own, even though he's a patriot and a warrior for his country. He's sacrificed [much] for that purpose, but at the expense at times of his humanity \u2013 which he occasionally recovers.\"<ref name=\"HurtCalgary\" /> In June 2015, when reflecting on how his reprisal in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' was different from this film, Hurt said, \"What I created [for ''The Incredible Hulk''] was a Ross who was right out of the graphic novel type of thing, where he was as much of a cartoon, in a way, as the monsters were. His ego was just as big and his problems were just as big. I really did do that consciously. I created a General Ross before which created a verisimilitude for the monsters, by making him a human monster. I worked really hard on the makeup and the exaggerated behavior and things like that and a controlled psychosis.\"<ref name=\"HurtLATimesJune2015\" /> [[Sam Elliott]] had expressed interest in reprising the role from the first ''Hulk'' film.<ref name=\"ElliottMTV\" />\n\n[[Robert Downey Jr.]] has an uncredited cameo as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a favor to [[Marvel Studios]], which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production.<ref name=\"DowneyCameo\" /> Hulk co-creator [[Stan Lee]] cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. [[Michael K. Williams]] appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"MichaelKWilliams\" /> [[Paul Soles]], who voiced Banner in the 1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' animated series, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. [[Rickson Gracie]] has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor; despite Gracie's [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] background, he is credited as an [[Aikido]] instructor. Brazilian actress [[D\u00e9bora Nascimento]] makes a cameo as Martina, Banner's colleague at a beverage factory. [[Peter Mensah]] plays a small role as General Joe Gellar, one of General Ross' military friends/associates. Christina Cabot portrays Major Kathleen Sparr, General Ross' personal aid.<ref name=\"ChristinaCabot\" /> Hulk supporting characters, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] and Jack McGee, make cameo appearances as Culver University students played by P.J. Kerr and Nicholas Rose, respectively.<ref name=\"WilsonMcGee\" /> [[Martin Starr]] plays a college student, credited as \"Computer Nerd\". This character was [[retcon|retroactively]] revealed to be [[Roger Harrington]], Starr's role in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), as confirmed in May 2019 by Feige.<ref name=\"FeigeStarr\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:IncredibleHulkTVreference.jpg|thumb|The writers of the film were influenced by the TV series of the same name. Example shown above: Norton (top) sitting in a more modern version of the machine Bill Bixby (below) sat in.]]\nAfter the release of [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', screenwriter [[James Schamus]] was planning a sequel which would continue the story featuring the Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains.<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\" /> Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> During the filming of ''Hulk'', producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date.<ref name=\"AradMay2005\" /> On January 18, 2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for ''The Incredible Hulk''{{'}}s production budget, with Universal distributing,<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\" /> because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel.<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \"''really'' starting the Marvel Hulk franchise\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what \"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series\".<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nLouis Leterrier, who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first film,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /><ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> had expressed interest in directing the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' film adaptation. [[Jon Favreau]] had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier's primary inspiration was [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]'s ''Hulk: Gray'' (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,<ref name=\"IGNJuly2006\" /> while Feige added the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself\".<ref name=\"FeigeWish\" /> Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".<ref name=\"May2006Empire\" />\n\n[[Zak Penn]], who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996, said the film would follow up ''Hulk'', but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' [[Hulk#Bibliography|run on the comic]]. He compared his script to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which was a very different film from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', but still in the same continuity.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film ''[[The Grand (film)|The Grand]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand.<ref name=\"TimesSquare\" /> Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> Feige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made ''Incredible Hulk'' was to get Hulk into the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> canon.\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGNApr2014\" />\n\nShortly after the release of ''The Incredible Hulk'', Gale Anne Hurd commented on the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' film. \"We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"reboot\" and \"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderHurdInt\" /> Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> \"Audiences know this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> The new origin story references [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.<ref name=\"ScifiWeekly\" /> Norton removed [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and toned down [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s presence.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns,<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> which references Bruce Jones' story.<ref name=\"ColliderFeige\" /> Norton rewrote scenes every day.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> Ultimately, the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided to credit the script solely to Penn,<ref name=\"PennSoleCredit\" /> who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]] explained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue.\"<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with [Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"<ref name=\"PennUnhappy\" /> Before either Penn or Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" />\n\n===Filming===\nLeterrier had to direct four [[second unit|units]] with a broken foot.<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place in [[Toronto]], because mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing [[Yonge Street]] for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Morningside Park (Toronto)|Morningside Park]]. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> There was also shooting in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> A factory in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], which was due for demolition, was the interior of the Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a [[backlot]] in Hamilton.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Other Canadian locations included [[CFB Trenton]] and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [[New York City]] and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"FilmingCFB\" /> While there, the crew shot at [[Rocinha]], [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], [[Tijuca Forest]] and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]]. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut [[carbon emissions]] and waste created during filming.<ref name=\"TorontoStar\" /> Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself is an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced [[pinus echinata|yellow pine]] instead of [[Decorative plywood|lauan]] for the sets, and also used zero-or low-[[Volatile Organic Compounds|VOC]] paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' became the first blockbuster film to receive the [[Environmental Media Association]]'s Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.<ref name=\"EMAGreenSeal\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Editing====\nSeventy minutes of footage, mostly dealing with the origin, were not included in the final cut.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Editor [[Kyle Cooper]], creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to ''Hulk'', had resulted in compressing these to the film's start.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the [[Arctic]] to commit [[suicide]]. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n\nNorton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton \"made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product\".<ref name=\"NYTimesRuntime\" /> Norton dismissed this: \"Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them.\"<ref name=\"EWbtsDrama\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:MovieAbomination.jpg|thumb|Leterrier's finished redesign of the Abomination]]\nLeterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard he was aiming for.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effects company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" /> Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an [[\u00fcber]]-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones, creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> The character also shares Roth's tattoos.<ref name=\"RothMTV\" /> A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II#Match|example]] of [[Mike Tyson]] when he fought [[Evander Holyfield]]), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.<ref name=\"AbombEars\" />\n\nLeterrier had planned to use [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[animatronic]]s to complement the [[computer-generated imagery]] that was solely used in the previous film.<ref name=\"Animatronic\" /> The make-up artists who worked on ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation,<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them].\"<ref name=\"PennBlonsky\" /> Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films since ''[[Alien 3]]'') was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic.<ref name=\"Woodruff\" /> An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and [[dry ice]] for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Incredible Hulk (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nThe score for the film was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], who was the [[arrangement|arranger]] for [[Massive Attack]], a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed]]''. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'').<ref name=\"MusicEye\" /> At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.<ref name=\"MusicHidden\" /> The film's score borrows [[Joe Harnell]]'s theme \"The Lonely Man\" from the 1978 ''Incredible Hulk'' television series.<ref name=harnell>{{cite web |url= http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |title= The Incredible Hulk: Music From the Television Pilot Movies |website= joeharnell.com |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141229232212/http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |archivedate= December 29, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Louis-Leterrier-Incroyable-Hulk-2.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Louis Leterrier]] promoting the film in [[Paris]] in July 2008]]\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"We know the Hulk from 2003 didn't satisfy the fans, and we had to acknowledge that.

Norton attended the premiere, took part in a ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' sketch and would also promote the film in Japan.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> However, during the film's release he chose to do charity work in Africa.<ref name=\"NortonAfrica\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered on June 8, 2008 at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]]<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> and was released in theaters on June 13 in the United States,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> where it opened in 3,505 theaters.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> The film is part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseOne\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' was formatted and screened in [[IMAX]] for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10 year anniversary IMAX festival.<ref name=\"IMAX10thAnniversaryFestival\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' was released by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on October 21, 2008. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening.<ref name=\"DVDDetails\" /><ref name=\"BRDDetails\" /> The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2008, in the United States (having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13). There are widescreen and fullscreen single-disc editions; a three-disc special edition; and a two-disc Blu-ray package. The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth, while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes, and the third with a [[Digital Copy|digital copy]] of the film. The Blu-ray edition combines the content of the first two DVDs onto a single disc, while the second disc contains the digital copy.\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"BriefcaseSet\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"BriefcaseDelayed\" /> Universal released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on April 10, 2018.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $134.8 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $128.6 million from other territories, for a worldwide total of $263.4 million.<ref name=\"BOMIncredibleHulk\" /> The film, even though it barely passed its predecessor, and only equalled it if the smaller budget of the first film is taken into account, was still considered successful. Entertainment analyst David Davis told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', \"The first Hulk had such high expectations after the [[NBC Universal]] merger and was supposed to be critical favorite Ang Lee's breakout commercial blockbuster. Then with the new Hulk film, Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of ''Iron Man'' this summer. So the new one overdelivered, relative to its underpromise.\"<ref name=\"THRBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend, becoming the top film at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> Behind ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', it was the second-highest gross for a film released over the [[Father's Day]] weekend.<ref name=\"VarietyBO\" /> This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed [[word of mouth]] would contribute to the film breaking even eventually.<ref name=\"LATimesBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' also opened in 38 other countries, adding $31 million to the total opening. The film outgrossed the 2003 film in South Korea, while its openings in [[Mexico]] and Russia created records for Universal.<ref name=\"VarietyOverseasBO\" /> The film grossed 24 million [[Renminbi|yuan]] (roughly $3.4 million) in its Chinese opening on August 26, outgrossing the previous film's overall gross of 10 million yuan.<ref name=\"ChineseBO\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 67% approval rating with an average score of 6.17/10 based on 231 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' may not be quite the smashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it offers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Incredible Hulk (2008)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_incredible_hulk/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> A [[CinemaScore]] poll indicated the majority of viewers were male and graded the film an A-, and 82% of them had seen the 2003 film.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" />\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in ''The Incredible Hulk''.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\" and \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three\u2014actually six\u2014hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements.\"<ref name=\"McCarthyReview\" /> Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' applauded that the film \"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's ''Hulk'' didn't: it's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity\".<ref name=\"RodriguezReview\" /> Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> [[Lou Lumenick]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, \"What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang] Lee took\".<ref name=\"LumenickReview\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] was not a fan of the film stating, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" />\n\nConversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" /> [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, \"'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".<ref name=\"ScottReview\" /> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns\".<ref name=\"AnsenReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award association\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" | 2008\n| [[2008 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]\n| Choice Summer Movie: Action\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[National Movie Awards]]\n| Best Superhero\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"NationalMovieAwards\" />\n|-\n| Best Performance \u2013 Male\n| Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\"|[[2008 Scream Awards|Scream Awards]]\n| Best Fantasy Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"6\"|<ref name=\"ScreamAwards\" /> \n|-\n| Best Fantasy Actor\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Superhero\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Remake\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Line\n| \"Hulk Smash\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Comic Book Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 2009\n| [[35th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]]\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"SaturnAwards\" />\n|}\n\n==Future==\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\nOf a potential sequel, Norton said, \"The whole thing was to envision it in multiple parts.

Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on,<ref name=\"NortonNotSigned\" /> but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel,<ref name=\"VarietyOutperform\" /> though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return.<ref name=\"LeterrierDH\" /> Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover.<ref name=\"MTVFeigeHulkAgain\" /> Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series, the second and third film of which had a 12-year gap.<ref name=\"MTVHurdSequel\" /> Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more films.<ref name=\"RothSequels\" /> Leterrier, after having previously said he did not want to direct a sequel,<ref name=\"LeterrierNo\" /> said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable.<ref name=\"LeterrierYes\" />\n\n[[Mark Ruffalo]] (Leterrier's first choice before casting Norton<ref name=\"HuffPost\" />) began his role as Banner / Hulk in ''The Avengers'', after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name=\"NortonReplaced\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRuffalo\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" /> In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to [[Collider (website)|Collider]] that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film.<ref name=\"April2012NoSequel\" /> In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"SequelPossible\" /> In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" and \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storylines, stated, \"everything [in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" /> In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see.

[[Ireland]] is an island to the north-west of [[continental Europe]]. Politically, Ireland is divided between the [[Republic of Ireland]], which covers just under five-sixths of the island, and [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the [[United Kingdom]], which covers the remainder and is located in the north-east of the island. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religious denomination, representing over 73% for the island and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Introduction of Christianity==\nThe introduction of [[Christianity in Ireland|Christianity to Ireland]] dates to sometime before the 5th century, presumably in interactions with Roman Britain. Christian worship had reached pagan Ireland around 400 AD. It is often misstated that [[St. Patrick]] brought the faith to Ireland, but it was already present on the island before Patrick arrived. Monasteries were built for monks who wanted permanent communion with God. The lengths they went to for tranquility are evident from the monastery of [[Skellig Michael]]. Via [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], Christianity spread among the [[Picts]] and [[Northumbrians]].\n\nScholars have long considered the term \"[[Celtic Church]]\" to be inappropriate for describing Christianity among [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] peoples, since this would imply a notion of unity, or a self-identifying entity, that did not exist.<ref>D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, ''Early Medieval Ireland 400\u20131200'' (London, 1995); T.

In 429, he was serving as a deacon in Rome. The Pope commissioned him to send [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]], Bishop of Auxerre, to investigate rumors of [[Pelagianism]] in Britain. In 431, [[Pope Celestine I]] consecrated Palladius a bishop and sent him to minister to the \"Scots believing in Christ\".<ref name=cusack>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Mission-St-Palladius.php|title=Mission of St. Palladius - Illustrated History of Ireland|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref> His mission mainly seems to have been to Irish Christians in the east midlands, Leinster, and perhaps east Munster. It is uncertain if he converted any Irish.

Further fresh arrivals came from Ireland and the monastery, with Columba as its abbot, was soon a flourishing institution, from which the [[Dal Riada|Dalriadian]] Scots in the south and the [[Picts]] beyond the [[Grampians]] were evangelized. When Columba died in 597, Christianity had been preached and received in every district in Caledonia, and in every island along its west coast. In the next century Iona had so prospered that its abbot, [[St. Adamnan]], wrote in excellent Latin the \"Life of St. Columba\". From Iona had gone south the Irish Aidan and his Irish companions to evangelize [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], and [[Essex]].\n\n==Missionaries abroad==\n[[Image:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Missionaries from Ireland]] to [[England]] and [[Continental Europe]] spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The period of [[Insular art]], mainly in the fields of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and the many carved [[high cross|stone crosses]] that dot the island.\n\nThese monasteries served as sanctuary to many of the continents great scholars and theologians. It was here that the lamp of Latin learning was preserved for the ages. During this age, the great illuminated manuscripts of Ireland were produced. Arguably the finest such work is ''[[The Book of Kells]]'' which may still be viewed at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nThe first significant renewal of learning in the West came with the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. [[Charlemagne]], advised by [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Alcuin of York]], attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by decree in AD 787 established schools in every abbey in his empire.  These schools, from which the name ''scholasticism'' is derived, became centres of medieval learning.  During the early [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period, knowledge of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek language]] had vanished in the west except in Ireland, where it was widely dispersed in the monastic schools.<ref>MacManus, p 215</ref>\n\nIrish scholars had a considerable presence in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish court]], where they were renowned for their learning.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\">{{Cite web|title=John Scottus Eriugena |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}</ref> Among them was [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], one of the founders of scholasticism.<ref name=\"Gothic\">Toman, p 10: \"[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] himself was\u2026 together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism.\"</ref> Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period, and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/> He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Greek theological tradition]].<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/>\n\n==Arrival of the Vikings==\n{{cleanup|section|date=March 2010}}\nDuring the ninth and tenth centuries, waves of Norse warriors ransacked the countryside. The monasteries were favourite targets for their treasures of golden religious ornaments.\n\nAs the eighth century neared its close, religion and learning still flourished, but unexpected dangers approached and a new enemy came, before whose assaults monk and monastery and saint and scholar disappeared. These invaders were the Danes from the coasts of Scandinavia. Pagans and pirates, they were formidable foes both on land and sea.\n\nIn Ireland as elsewhere they attacked the monasteries and churches, desecrated the altars, carried away the gold and silver vessels, and smoking ruins and murdered monks attested the fury of their assaults. Under native and Christian chiefs churches were destroyed, church lands appropriated by laymen, monastic schools deserted, and lay abbots ruled at Armagh and elsewhere. Bishops were consecrated without sees and conferred orders for money, there was chaos in church government and corruption everywhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn a series of synods beginning with [[Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail|R\u00e1th Breasail]] (1118) and including [[Synod of Kells|Kells]] (1152), at which the [[Papal legate|pope's legate]] presided, many salutary enactments were passed, and for the first time [[Diocesan bishop|diocesan episcopacy]] was established. Meanwhile, [[St. Malachy]], Archbishop of Armagh, had done very remarkable work in his own diocese and elsewhere. His early death in 1148 was a heavy blow to the cause of church reform. Nor could so many evils be cured in a single life, or by the labours of a single man; and in spite of his efforts and the efforts of others the decrees of synods were often flouted, and the new diocesan boundaries ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Anglo-Normans==\nIn December 1154, Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, by the [[Treaty of Wallingford]] and a large fleet, became in addition [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], King of England. In that same month an Englishman, [[Nicholas Breakspeare]], was elected [[Pope Adrian IV]]. Henry intended, as shown by his later [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], to establish the supremacy of the civil law and courts above the [[ecclesiastical]] law and courts. In the first full year of Henry's reign (1155) he procured the Papal Bull [[Laudabiliter]] from the Hertfordshire born [[Pope Adrian IV]] authorizing Henry to proceed to conquer Ireland \"to check the torrent of wickedness to reform evil manners, to sow the seeds of virtue\". The quid pro quo was the condition that a penny should be yearly paid from each house to the See of Rome (the still extant Peter's Pence). Henry and the Pope also had other reasons (see [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], section \"Lordship over Ireland\"). The invasion was put aside while Henry attended to other matters. Henry continued to battle the supreme power of the Church, and [[Thomas Becket]] in England. In 1166, Henry took the opportunity to accede to the request by displaced Irish [[R\u00ed]] of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] for assistance in regaining his Irish territory. A first contingent of the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]] came to Ireland in 1169 under [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan|Maurice Fitzgerald]], followed by a stronger force under Strongbow ([[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]) in 1170, the year Thomas \u00e0 Beckett was murdered. In 1171 Henry himself landed at Waterford and proceeded to Dublin, where he spent the winter, and received the submission of most of the Irish chiefs. This submission was outlined in the [[Treaty of Windsor 1175]].\n\n==Reformation and beyond==\nIt was not until the end of the 17th centuries that the Crown of England gained full control of Ireland by means of [[History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)|a series of military campaigns]] in the period 1534\u20131691.  During this period, the island was progressively [[Plantations of Ireland|colonised]] by English and Scottish Protestant settlers.  Most of the Irish remained Roman Catholic.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] decided to destroy the power of the Anglo-Norman kings and take control of Ireland. As he did so, he put English lords in charge of confiscated land and plundered the Catholic monasteries and churches, as he had done in England. In 1536 during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], Henry arranged to be declared head of the Church in Ireland through an act of the Irish Parliament. When the [[Church of England]] was reformed under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], so too was the Church of Ireland.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign, Henry VIII was preoccupied with more pressing matters in England and on the European Continent, and therefore paid little attention to Ireland.  It was not until he had reigned for a quarter of a century on the throne that he turned his attention to Ireland and then it was primarily due his conflict with the Church over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.  Then Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which invested Henry with spiritual jurisdiction over England and proclaimed him head of the Church of England rather than the Pope.  When the proctors of the clergy refused to agree to this measure, the irate monarch deprived them of the right of voting, confiscated church lands and suppressed monasteries, in some cases shedding the blood of their inmates, in the remaining cases evicting them and making them homeless and poor.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\nFearing Ireland's Catholicism and strategic value for her enemies, Elizabeth consolidated English power in Ireland.\n\nThe [[established church]] in Ireland underwent a period of more radical [[Calvinist]] doctrine than occurred in England. [[James Ussher]] (later [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]) authored the [[Irish Articles]], adopted in 1615. In 1634, the [[Irish Convocation]] adopted the English [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] alongside the Irish Articles.  After the Restoration of 1660, it seems that the Thirty-Nine Articles took precedence; they remain the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.vi.x.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

The History of Creeds. - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}</ref>\n\nThe English-speaking minority mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism, while the Irish-speaking majority remained faithful to the Latin liturgy of Roman Catholicism. From this period on, sectarian conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\n\n===Translation of the Bible into Irish===\nThe first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by [[Nicholas Walsh (Bishop of Ossory)|Nicholas Walsh]], [[Bishop of Ossory]], who worked on it until he was murdered in 1585. The work was continued by John Kearny, his assistant, and [[Nehemiah Donellan]], [[Church of Ireland Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]]; it was finally completed by [[William O'Domhnuill]] (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by [[William Bedel]] (1571\u20131642), [[Bishop of Kilmore (Church of Ireland)|Bishop of Kilmore]], who completed his translation within the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], although it was not published until 1680 in a revised version by [[Narcissus Marsh]] (1638\u20131713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell had undertaken a translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664\u20131747) and published in 1712.\n\nThe first translation of the entire Bible that was approved by the church was ''An B\u00edobla Naofa'', supervised by [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta]] at [[Maynooth]] and published in 1981.\n\n==Persecution and Penal Laws==\n\nThe [[Irish Confederate Wars]] resulted in much destruction of church property. Irish Catholics were severely persecuted under [[Oliver Cromwell]], their situation only slightly improving under the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings. The land settlements in the aftermath of these wars, and the defeat of James II in 1691, reduced Irish Catholic freeholders to a fraction of their previous size. The introduction of the [[Penal Laws]] further proscribed the practise of Roman Catholicism, with many priests and bishops forced into hiding or exile. Not until the 1770s did the religious climate relax, somewhat.\n\n==Protestant ascendancy (1691\u20131801)==\n{{Main article|Ireland 1691\u20131801}}\n\nBefore the Stuart accession, Ireland was divided into thirty-four [[borough]]s. In 1613, forty new boroughs were created, all of them dominated by Protestants.  The consequence of this was the reduction of the Catholic majority in the Irish parliament to a minority.  By the end of the seventeenth century all Catholics, representing some 85% of Ireland's population then, were banned from the Irish parliament. As a result, political power rested entirely in the hands of a British settler-colonial, and more specifically [[Anglican]], minority while the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] population suffered severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|political and economic privations]].\n\nBy the late 18th century, many of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[ruling class]] had come to see Ireland as their native country. A Parliamentary faction led by [[Henry Grattan]] agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with England and for greater legislative independence for the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals to [[Catholic Emancipation|enfranchise Irish Catholics]]. This was enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet enter parliament or become government officials.\n\n===Oath of Allegiance===\nBy the [[Treaty of Limerick]] the Catholic soldiers of King James were pardoned, protected against forfeiture of their estates, and were free to go abroad if they chose. All Catholics might substitute an oath of allegiance for the oath of supremacy, and were to have such privileges \"as were consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles II\". King William also promised to have the Irish Parliament grant a further relaxation of the penal laws in force. This treaty, however, was soon torn to shreds, and in spite of William's appeals the Irish Parliament refused to ratify it, and embarked on fresh penal legislation. Under these new laws Catholics were excluded from Parliament, from the bench and bar, from the army and navy, from all civil offices, from the corporations, and even from the corporate towns. They could not have Catholic schools at home or attend foreign schools, or inherit landed property, or hold land under lease, or act as executors or administrators, or have arms or ammunition, or a horse worth \u00a35. Neither could they bury their dead in Catholic ruins, or make pilgrimages to holy wells, or observe Catholic holidays. They could not intermarry with the Protestants, the clergyman assisting at such marriages being liable to death. The wife of a Catholic landlord turning Protestant got separate maintenance; the son turning Protestant got the whole estate; and the Catholic landlord having only Catholic children was obliged at death to divide his estate among his children in equal shares. All the [[regular clergy]], as well as bishops and vicars-general should quit the kingdom. The [[secular clergy]] might remain, but must be registered, nor could they have on their churches either steeple or bell.\n\nIn 1728, the Catholics outnumbered Protestants 5 to 1. A few Catholics managed to hold their estates with the collaboration of friendly Protestants; the remainder gradually sank to the level of [[Cotter (farmer)|cottiers]] and day-labourers, reduced to a standard of living far below what they had been used to. Many Catholics chose to emigrate in the hopes of finding a more congenial environment.\n\n===Irish Parliament and the Passing of Tolerance===\nIn the Irish Parliament meanwhile a spirit of independence appeared. As the Parliament of the Pale it had been so often used for factious purposes that in 1496 [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was passed, providing that henceforth no Irish Parliament could meet, and no law could be proposed, without the previous consent of both the [[Irish Privy Council|Irish]] and [[Privy Council of England|English Privy Council]]s. Further, the English Parliament claimed the right to legislate for Ireland; and in the laws prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle (1665), and Irish woollen manufactures (1698), and that dealing with the Irish forfeited estates (1700), it asserted its supposed right.\n\nWhen one member, Molyneux, protested, the English Parliament condemned him, and ordered his book to be burned by the common hangman. Moreover, it passed [[Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719|an Act in 1719]] expressly declaring that it had power to legislate for Ireland, taking away also the appellate jurisdiction of the [[Irish House of Lords]]. The fight made by Swift against Wood's halfpence showed that, though Molyneux was dead, his spirit lived; Lucas continued the fight, and [[Henry Grattan|Grattan]] in [[Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782|1782 obtained legislative independence]].\n\nIn 1778 by an Act enabling Catholics to hold all lands under lease; and in 1782 by a further Act allowing them to erect Catholic schools, with the permission of the Protestant bishop of the diocese, to own a horse worth more than \u00a35, and to assist at Mass without being compelled to accuse the officiating priest. Nor were Catholic bishops any longer compelled to quit the kingdom, nor Catholic children specially rewarded if they turned Protestant. Not for ten years was there any further concession, and then an Act was passed allowing Catholics to erect schools without seeking Protestant permission, admitting Catholics to the Bar, and legalizing marriages between Protestants and Catholics. Much more important was the Act of 1793 giving the Catholics the Parliamentary and municipal franchise, admitting them to the universities and to military and civil offices, and removing all restrictions in regard to the tenure of land. They were still excluded from Parliament, from the inner Bar, and from a few of the higher civil and military offices.\n\nAlways in favour of religious liberty, Grattan would have swept away every vestige of the Penal code. But, in 1782, he mistakenly thought that his work was done when legislative independence was conceded. He forgot that the executive was still left independent of Parliament, answerable only to the English ministry; and that, with rotten boroughs controlled by a few great families, with an extremely limited franchise in the counties, and with pensioners and [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] filling so many seats, the Irish Parliament was but a mockery of representation.\n\nLike Grattan, [[Henry Flood|Flood]] and Charlemont favoured Parliamentary reform, but, unlike him, they were opposed to Catholic concessions. As for Foster and Fitzgibbon, who led the forces of corruption and bigotry, they opposed every attempt at reform, and consented to the Act of 1793 only under strong pressure from [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Dundas]]. These English ministers, alarmed at the progress of [[French revolution]]ary principles in Ireland, fearing a foreign invasion, wished to have the Catholics contented. In 1795 further concessions seemed imminent. In that year an illiberal [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|viceroy]], [[John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Westmoreland]], was replaced by the liberal-minded [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], who came understanding it to be the wish of Pitt that the Catholic claims were to be conceded. He at once dismissed from office a rapacious office-holder named [[John Beresford (statesman)|Beresford]], so powerful that he was called the \"King of Ireland\"; he refused to consult [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland|Lord Chancellor]] [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Fitzgibbon]] or [[John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel|Foster]], the Speaker; he took Grattan and [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|Ponsonby]] into his confidence, and declared his intention to support Grattan's bill admitting Catholics to Parliament. The high hopes raised by these events were dashed to the earth when Fitzwilliam was suddenly recalled, after having been allowed to go so far without any protest from [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Portland]], the home secretary, or from the premier, Pitt. The latter, disliking the Irish Parliament because it had rejected his commercial propositions in 1785, and disagreed with him on the regency in 1789, already mediated a legislative union, and felt that the admission of Catholics to Parliament would thwart his plans. He was probably also influenced by Beresford, who had powerful friends in England, and by [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], whom Fitzgibbon had mischievously convinced that to admit Catholics to Parliament would be to violate his coronation oath. Possibly, other causes concurred with these to bring about the sudden and disastrous change which filled Catholic Ireland with grief, and the whole nation with dismay.\n\nThe new viceroy, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], was instructed to conciliate the Catholic bishops by setting up a Catholic college for the training of Irish priests; this was done by the establishment of [[Maynooth College]]. But he was to set his face against all Parliamentary reform and all Catholic concessions. These things he did with a will. He at once restored Beresford to office and Foster and Fitzgibbon to favour, the latter being made Earl of Clare. And he stirred up but too successfully the dying embers of sectarian hate, with the result that the Ulster factions, the Protestant \"[[Peep-of-Day Boys]]\" and the Catholic \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\", became embittered with a change of names. The latter, turning to republican and revolutionary ways, joined the [[United Irish Society]]; the former became merged in the recently{{when|date=January 2011}} formed [[Orange Institution|Orange Society]], taking its name from William of Orange and having Protestant ascendancy and hatred of Catholicism as its battle cries. Extending from Ulster, these rival societies brought into the other provinces the curse of sectarian strife. Instead of putting down both, the Government took sides with the Orangemen; and, while their lawless acts were condoned, the Catholics were hunted down. An Arms' Act, an Insurrection Act, an Indemnity Act, a suspension of the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] placed them outside the pale of law. An undisciplined soldiery, recruited from the Orange lodges, were then let loose among them. Martial law, free quarters, flogging, picketing, [[half-hanging]], destruction of Catholic property and life, outrages on women followed, until at last Catholic blood was turned into flame. Then [[Wexford Rebellion|Wexford rose]]. Looking back, it now seems certain that, had [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] landed at Bantry in 1796, had even a small force landed at Wexford in 1798, or a few other counties displayed the heroism of Wexford, English power in Ireland would, temporarily at least, have been destroyed. But one county could not fight the British Empire, and the rebellion was soon quenched in blood.\n\nCamden's place was then given to [[Lord Cornwallis]], who came to Ireland for the express purpose of carrying a Legislative Union. Foster refused to support him and joined the opposition. Fitzgibbon, however, aided Cornwallis, and so did [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], who for some time had discharged the duties of chief secretary in the absence of [[Henry Pelham|Mr. Pelham]], and who was now formally appointed to the office. And then began one of the most shameful chapters in Irish history. Even the corrupt Irish Parliament was reluctant to vote away its existence, and in 1799 the opposition was too strong for Castlereagh. But Pitt directed him to persevere, and the great struggle went on. On one side were eloquence and debating power, patriotism, and public virtue, Grattan, Plunket, and Bushe, Foster, Fitzgerald, Ponsonby, and Moore, a truly formidable combination. On the other side were the baser elements of in Parliament, the needy, the spendthrift, the meanly ambitious, operated upon by Castlereagh, with the whole resources of the British Empire at his command. The pensioners and placemen who voted against him at once lost their places and pensions, the military officer was refused promotion, the magistrate was turned off the bench. And while anti-Unionists were unsparingly punished, the Unionists got lavish rewards. The impecunious got well-paid sinecures; the briefless barrister was made a judge or a commissioner; the rich man, ambitious of social distinction, got a peerage, and places and pensions for his friends; and the owners of rotten boroughs to large sums for their interests. The Catholics were promised emancipation in a united Parliament, and in consequence many bishops, some clergy, and a few of the laity supported the Union, not grudging to end an assembly so bigoted and corrupt as the Irish Parliament. By these means Castlereagh triumphed, and in 1801 the United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland opened its doors.\n\n===Catholic Emancipation===\nThe next quarter of a century was a period of unrequited hope. [[Dr. Troy]], the Archbishop of Dublin, had been a strong advocate of the Union, and had induced nine of his brother bishops to concede a veto on episcopal appointments, not uncommon in European monarchies. In return, he wanted [[Catholic Emancipation|Emancipation]] linked with the Union.  Castlereagh was not averse; but Pitt was publicly non-committal and vague, though the Catholic Unionists had no doubt that he favoured linking concession with passage of the Union thereby creating a totally new dispensation for a United Kingdom. Disappointment ensued when nothing was done in the first session of the United Parliament, and it was increased when Pitt resigned office and was succeeded by [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]], the narrow-minded Speaker. Cornwallis, however, assured Dr. Troy that Pitt had resigned, unable to overcome the reluctance of King George III, who believed it contravened the Act of Settlement, and his coronation oath. Pitt declared that he would never again take office if emancipation were not conceded. In spite of this, he became Premier again in 1804, no longer an advocate of emancipation having pledged never again to raise the question in Parliament during the lifetime of the king. To this pledge he was as faithful as he had been false to his former assurances; when [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] presented the Catholic petition in 1805, Pitt opposed it. After 1806, when both Pitt and Fox died, the Catholic champion was Grattan, who had entered the British Parliament in 1805. In the vain hope of conciliating opponents he was willing, in 1808, to concede the veto. Dr. Troy and the higher Catholics acquiesced. The other bishops were unwilling, and rejected  the offer of a state-paid clergy or state-appointed bishops. The agitation of the question, however, did not cease, and for many years it distracted Catholic plans and weakened Catholic effort. Further complications arose when, in 1814, the prefect of the Propaganda, Quarantotti, issued a rescript favouring the veto. He acted, however, beyond his powers in the absence of [[Pius VII]], who was in France. When the Pope returned to Rome, after the fall of [[Napoleon]], the rescript was disavowed.\n\nIn these years the Catholics badly needed a leader. [[John Keogh]], the able leader of 1793, was then old, and Lords Fingall and Gormanstone, Mr. Scully and Dr. Dromgoole, were not the men to grapple with great difficulties and powerful opponents. An abler and more vigorous leader was required, one with less faith in petitions and protestations of loyalty. Such a leader was found in [[Daniel O'Connell]], a Catholic barrister whose first public appearance in 1800 was on an anti-Unionist platform. A great lawyer and orator, a great debater, of boundless courage and resources, he took a prominent part on Catholic committees, and from 1810 he held the first place in Catholic esteem. Yet the Catholic cause advanced slowly, and, when Grattan died in 1820, emancipation had not come. Nor would the House of Lords accept Plunket's Bill of 1821, even though it passed the House of Commons and conceded the veto. At last O'Connell determined to rouse the masses, and in 1823, with the help of [[Richard Lalor Sheil]], he founded the [[Catholic Association]]. Its progress at first was slow, but gradually it gathered strength. [[Daniel Murray (archbishop)|Dr. Murray]], the new Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, joined it, and [[James Warren Doyle|Dr. Doyle]], the great Bishop of Kildare; other bishops followed; the clergy and people also came in; and thus rose a great national organization, supervising from its central office in Dublin subsidiary associations in every parish; maintained by a Catholic rent; watching over local and national affairs, discharging, as Mr. Canning described it, \"all the functions of a regular government, and having obtained a complete mastery and control over the masses of the Irish people\". The Association was suppressed in 1825 by Act of Parliament; but O'Connell merely changed the name; and the New Catholic Association with its New Catholic rent continued the work of agitation as of old. Nor was this all. By the Catholic Relief Act of 1793 the forty-shilling freeholders obtained the franchise. These freeholders were in the power of the landlords. Protected by a powerful association, and encouraged by the priests and by O'Connell, the freeholders broke free. In Waterford, Louth, Meath, and elsewhere they voted for the nominees of the Catholic Association at elections, and humbled the landlords. They returned O'Connell himself for Clare in 1828. The Tory ministers, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Robert Peel|Peel]], steered the passage of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill of 1829]]. The forty-shilling freeholders, however, were temporarily disfranchised, and provisions excluding Catholics from some of the higher civil and military offices, prohibiting priests from wearing vestments outside their churches, bishops from assuming the titles of their sees, and clergy from obtaining charitable bequests. In other respects U.K. Roman Catholics were placed on a level with other denominations, and at last were fully admitted within to the benefits fruits of the constitution.\n\nThe Irish Catholics had several grievances still calling for redress: the [[Church of Ireland|established state Church]], landlordism, and educational inequality. Mr. Gladstone commenced with the Church of Ireland. He introduced [[Irish Church Act 1869|a Bill]] disendowing and disestablishing it. Commissioners were appointed to wind it up, taking charge of its property, then computed at more than \u00a315,000,000. Of this sum, \u00a311,000,000, was given to the disestablished Church, part to the holders of existing offices, part to enable the Church to continue its work. A further sum of nearly \u00a31,000,000 was distributed between Maynooth College, deprived of its annual grant, and the Presbyterian Church deprived of the [[Regium Donum]], the latter getting twice as much as the former. The surplus was to be disposed of by Parliament for such public objects as it might determine.\n\n==Free State and Republic (1922\u2013present)==\n[[Image:Ei-map.svg|right|thumb|Political map of Ireland]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has had a powerful influence over the Irish state since its inception in 1922 although that influence has diminished somewhat in recent decades. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, banning, for example, [[divorce]], [[contraception]], [[abortion]] and [[pornography]] as well as encouraging the censoring of many books and films. In addition the church largely controlled the state's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\n\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.<ref>M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868\u20131966, (1993) p.431</ref> By the 1960s, the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as  British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as ''[[Ne Temere]]'', whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics.\n\n==Sexual abuse scandals==\n\nSince the early 1990s, the church in Ireland has been rocked by many cases of sexual abuse. Enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children in previous decades. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, assisted by senior clergy. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions.\n\nSee [[Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland]] and [[Magdalene asylum]]\n\n==Influence on Irish society==\n\n===Ireland===\n\n====Politics====\nIn the [[Irish Free State]], now [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the church had a great influence on public opinion as it had supervised public education for about 90% of the population since at least the 1830s. Historically it was associated with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] movement until 1766, and with [[Irish nationalism]] after [[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in 1829. The church was resurgent between 1829 and the disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1869\u201371, when its most significant leaders included [[Bishop James Doyle]], [[Cardinal Cullen]] and [[John MacHale|Archbishop MacHale]]. The hierarchy supported the democratic and mainly non-violent [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the 1880s, and its offshoots, and the policy of [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish Home Rule]] in 1886\u20131920. It did not support the [[Irish republican]] movement until 1921, as it espoused violence, in spite of support from many individual priests, and opposed the anti-Treaty side in the [[Irish Civil War]]. Despite this relative moderation, Irish Protestants were concerned that a self-governing Ireland would result in \"[[Rome Rule]]\" instead of home rule, and this became an element in the creation of [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nMajor popular church events attended by the political world have included the [[Eucharistic Congress]] in 1932 and the [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|Papal Visit]] in 1979. The last prelate with strong social and political interests was [[John Charles McQuaid|Archbishop McQuaid]], who retired in 1972.\n\n====Education====\nAfter independence in 1922, the Church remained heavily involved in health care and education, raising money and running institutions which were staffed by Catholic [[religious institute]]s, largely because the new state remained impoverished. Its main political effect was to continue to run schools where religious education was a major element. The hierarchy opposed the free public secondary schools service introduced in 1968 by [[Donogh O'Malley]], in part because they ran almost all such schools. Some have argued that the church's strong efforts since the 1830s to continue the control of Catholic education was primarily to guarantee a continuing source of candidates for the priesthood, as they would have years of training before entering a seminary.<ref>E. Brian Titley \"''Church, State and the control of schooling in Ireland 1900\u20131944''\"; McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, New York 1983.</ref>\n\n====Health care====\nFrom 1930 hospitals were funded by a [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake|sweepstake]] (lottery) with tickets frequently distributed or sold by nuns or priests{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  On health matters it was seen as unsympathetic to women's needs and in 1950 it opposed the [[Mother and Child Scheme]].\n\n====Morality and censorship====\nIt helped reinforce public [[censorship]] and maintained its own list of banned literature which influenced the State's list. Divorce allowing remarriage was banned in 1924 (though it had been rare), and selling artificial contraception was made illegal. The Church's influence slipped somewhat after 1970, impacted partly by the media and the growing [[feminist]] movement. For instance the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979]] showed the ability of the Catholic Church to force the government into a compromise situation over artificial [[contraception]], though unable to get the result it wanted; contraception could now be bought, but only with a prescription from a doctor and supplied only by registered chemists. In the 1983 Amendment to the [[Irish constitution|constitution]] introduced the constitutional prohibition of [[abortion]], which the Church supported, though abortion for social reasons remains illegal under Irish statute law. However the Church failed to influence the  June 1996, removal of the constitutional prohibition of divorce. While the church had opposed divorce allowing remarriage in civil law, its [[canon law]] allowed for a law of [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]] and a limited divorce \"''a mensa et thoro''\", effectively a form of marital separation.  In a further repudiation of the church's teaching, on 22 May 2015, 62% of Irish voters approved the legalization of [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|same sex marriage]] in Ireland.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act of 1920]] acted as the constitution of [[Northern Ireland]], in which was enshrined freedom of religion for all of Northern Ireland's citizens.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/goi231220.htm#1\n| title = The Constitution of Northern Ireland being the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as amended (Clause 5)\n| accessdate = 13 February 2007\n| author = His Majesty's Government\n| date = 23 December 1920\n| work = Government of Ireland Act, 1920\n| publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1956\n}}</ref> Here Roman Catholics formed a minority of some 35% of the population, which had mostly supported Irish nationalism and was therefore historically opposed to the creation of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Roman Catholic schools' council was at first resistant in accepting the role of the government of Northern Ireland, and initially accepted funding only from the government of the [[Irish Free State]] and admitting no school inspectors. Thus it was that the [[Sir Robert Lynn|Lynn]] Committee presented a report to the government, from which an Education Bill was created to update the education system in Northern Ireland, without any co-operation from the Roman Catholic section in education. Instead, in regard to the Roman Catholic schools, the report relied on the guidance of a Roman Catholic who was to become the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Education \u2014 [[Andrew Nicholas Bonaparte Wyse|A. N. Bonaparte Wyse]].\n\n{{Cquote|We hope that, notwithstanding the disadvantage at which we were placed by this action, it will be found that Roman Catholic interests have not suffered. We have throughout been careful to keep in mind and to make allowance for the particular points of view of Roman Catholics in regard to education so far as known to us, and it has been our desire to refrain as far as we could from recommending any course which might be thought to be contrary to their wishes.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Morrison\n | first = John\n | title = The Ulster Cover-Up\n | year = 1993\n | publisher = Ulster Society (Publications)\n | location = [[Northern Ireland]]\n | isbn =1-872076-15-7\n | chapter = The Ulster Government and Internal Opposition\n | page = 40\n }}</ref>|20px|20px|Lynn Commission report, 1923}}\n\nMany commentators have suggested that the separate education systems in Northern Ireland after 1921 prolonged the sectarian divisions in that community. Cases of [[gerrymandering]] and preference in public services for non-Catholics led to the need for a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in 1967.\n\n===Vatican II===\nIn both parts of Ireland Church policy and practice changed markedly after the [[Vatican II]] reforms of 1962. Probably the largest change was that [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] could be said in [[vernacular]] languages and not in [[Latin]], and in 1981 the Church commissioned its first edition of the [[Bible]] in [[Irish language|Irish]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catholic Church in Ireland]]\n* [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|title=History of the Christian Church, Volume IV:Mediavel christianity.

[[Ireland]] is an island to the north-west of [[continental Europe]]. Politically, Ireland is divided between the [[Republic of Ireland]], which covers just under five-sixths of the island, and [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the [[United Kingdom]], which covers the remainder and is located in the north-east of the island. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religious denomination, representing over 73% for the island and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Introduction of Christianity==\nThe introduction of [[Christianity in Ireland|Christianity to Ireland]] dates to sometime before the 5th century, presumably in interactions with Roman Britain. Christian worship had reached pagan Ireland around 400 AD. It is often misstated that [[St. Patrick]] brought the faith to Ireland, but it was already present on the island before Patrick arrived. Monasteries were built for monks who wanted permanent communion with God. The lengths they went to for tranquility are evident from the monastery of [[Skellig Michael]]. Via [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], Christianity spread among the [[Picts]] and [[Northumbrians]].\n\nScholars have long considered the term \"[[Celtic Church]]\" to be inappropriate for describing Christianity among [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] peoples, since this would imply a notion of unity, or a self-identifying entity, that did not exist.<ref>D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, ''Early Medieval Ireland 400\u20131200'' (London, 1995); T.

Stephen Baxter (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), pp. 207\u2013208, 220 n. 3</ref> Some scholars have chosen to apply the term \"[[Insular Christianity]]\" to this Christian practice that arose around the [[Irish Sea]].\n\n==Palladius and Patrick==\nAccording to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] was from a noble family in [[Gaul]]. In 429, he was serving as a deacon in Rome. The Pope commissioned him to send [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]], Bishop of Auxerre, to investigate rumors of [[Pelagianism]] in Britain. In 431, [[Pope Celestine I]] consecrated Palladius a bishop and sent him to minister to the \"Scots believing in Christ\".<ref name=cusack>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Mission-St-Palladius.php|title=Mission of St. Palladius - Illustrated History of Ireland|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref> His mission mainly seems to have been to Irish Christians in the east midlands, Leinster, and perhaps east Munster. It is uncertain if he converted any Irish. What little is known of his mission appears to have been successful, though it was later downplayed by partisans of Patrick.\n\nSaint Patrick's dates are uncertain. All that can be said is that he was alive sometime in the fifth century, and was a missionary bishop rather than ministering to Christians. His areas appear to have been Ulster and north Connacht, but very little can be said with certainty about him. Later tradition from the seventh-century onwards is known to be unreliable.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Native ministries and Irish monasteries==\nMonastic establishments arose in the sixth century, such as [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]], founded by [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finian]], [[Clonfert]] by [[St. Brendan]], [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] by [[St. Comgall]], [[Clonmacnoise]] by [[Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise|St. Kieran]], [[Killeaney]] by [[St. Enda of Aran|St. Enda]]; and, in the seventh century, [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] by [[St. Carthage]] and [[Glendalough]] by [[St Kevin|St. Kevin]].\n\nIn 563, [[St. Columba]], a native of Donegal, accompanied by a few companions, crossed the sea to [[Caledonia]] and founded a monastery on the desolate island of [[Iona]]. Further fresh arrivals came from Ireland and the monastery, with Columba as its abbot, was soon a flourishing institution, from which the [[Dal Riada|Dalriadian]] Scots in the south and the [[Picts]] beyond the [[Grampians]] were evangelized. When Columba died in 597, Christianity had been preached and received in every district in Caledonia, and in every island along its west coast. In the next century Iona had so prospered that its abbot, [[St. Adamnan]], wrote in excellent Latin the \"Life of St. Columba\". From Iona had gone south the Irish Aidan and his Irish companions to evangelize [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], and [[Essex]].\n\n==Missionaries abroad==\n[[Image:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Missionaries from Ireland]] to [[England]] and [[Continental Europe]] spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The period of [[Insular art]], mainly in the fields of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and the many carved [[high cross|stone crosses]] that dot the island.\n\nThese monasteries served as sanctuary to many of the continents great scholars and theologians. It was here that the lamp of Latin learning was preserved for the ages. During this age, the great illuminated manuscripts of Ireland were produced. Arguably the finest such work is ''[[The Book of Kells]]'' which may still be viewed at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nThe first significant renewal of learning in the West came with the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. [[Charlemagne]], advised by [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Alcuin of York]], attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by decree in AD 787 established schools in every abbey in his empire.  These schools, from which the name ''scholasticism'' is derived, became centres of medieval learning.  During the early [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period, knowledge of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek language]] had vanished in the west except in Ireland, where it was widely dispersed in the monastic schools.<ref>MacManus, p 215</ref>\n\nIrish scholars had a considerable presence in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish court]], where they were renowned for their learning.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\">{{Cite web|title=John Scottus Eriugena |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}</ref> Among them was [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], one of the founders of scholasticism.<ref name=\"Gothic\">Toman, p 10: \"[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] himself was\u2026 together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism.\"</ref> Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period, and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/> He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Greek theological tradition]].<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/>\n\n==Arrival of the Vikings==\n{{cleanup|section|date=March 2010}}\nDuring the ninth and tenth centuries, waves of Norse warriors ransacked the countryside. The monasteries were favourite targets for their treasures of golden religious ornaments.\n\nAs the eighth century neared its close, religion and learning still flourished, but unexpected dangers approached and a new enemy came, before whose assaults monk and monastery and saint and scholar disappeared. These invaders were the Danes from the coasts of Scandinavia. Pagans and pirates, they were formidable foes both on land and sea.\n\nIn Ireland as elsewhere they attacked the monasteries and churches, desecrated the altars, carried away the gold and silver vessels, and smoking ruins and murdered monks attested the fury of their assaults. Under native and Christian chiefs churches were destroyed, church lands appropriated by laymen, monastic schools deserted, and lay abbots ruled at Armagh and elsewhere. Bishops were consecrated without sees and conferred orders for money, there was chaos in church government and corruption everywhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn a series of synods beginning with [[Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail|R\u00e1th Breasail]] (1118) and including [[Synod of Kells|Kells]] (1152), at which the [[Papal legate|pope's legate]] presided, many salutary enactments were passed, and for the first time [[Diocesan bishop|diocesan episcopacy]] was established. Meanwhile, [[St. Malachy]], Archbishop of Armagh, had done very remarkable work in his own diocese and elsewhere. His early death in 1148 was a heavy blow to the cause of church reform. Nor could so many evils be cured in a single life, or by the labours of a single man; and in spite of his efforts and the efforts of others the decrees of synods were often flouted, and the new diocesan boundaries ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Anglo-Normans==\nIn December 1154, Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, by the [[Treaty of Wallingford]] and a large fleet, became in addition [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], King of England. In that same month an Englishman, [[Nicholas Breakspeare]], was elected [[Pope Adrian IV]]. Henry intended, as shown by his later [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], to establish the supremacy of the civil law and courts above the [[ecclesiastical]] law and courts. In the first full year of Henry's reign (1155) he procured the Papal Bull [[Laudabiliter]] from the Hertfordshire born [[Pope Adrian IV]] authorizing Henry to proceed to conquer Ireland \"to check the torrent of wickedness to reform evil manners, to sow the seeds of virtue\". The quid pro quo was the condition that a penny should be yearly paid from each house to the See of Rome (the still extant Peter's Pence). Henry and the Pope also had other reasons (see [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], section \"Lordship over Ireland\"). The invasion was put aside while Henry attended to other matters. Henry continued to battle the supreme power of the Church, and [[Thomas Becket]] in England. In 1166, Henry took the opportunity to accede to the request by displaced Irish [[R\u00ed]] of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] for assistance in regaining his Irish territory. A first contingent of the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]] came to Ireland in 1169 under [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan|Maurice Fitzgerald]], followed by a stronger force under Strongbow ([[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]) in 1170, the year Thomas \u00e0 Beckett was murdered. In 1171 Henry himself landed at Waterford and proceeded to Dublin, where he spent the winter, and received the submission of most of the Irish chiefs. This submission was outlined in the [[Treaty of Windsor 1175]].\n\n==Reformation and beyond==\nIt was not until the end of the 17th centuries that the Crown of England gained full control of Ireland by means of [[History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)|a series of military campaigns]] in the period 1534\u20131691.  During this period, the island was progressively [[Plantations of Ireland|colonised]] by English and Scottish Protestant settlers.  Most of the Irish remained Roman Catholic.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] decided to destroy the power of the Anglo-Norman kings and take control of Ireland. As he did so, he put English lords in charge of confiscated land and plundered the Catholic monasteries and churches, as he had done in England. In 1536 during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], Henry arranged to be declared head of the Church in Ireland through an act of the Irish Parliament. When the [[Church of England]] was reformed under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], so too was the Church of Ireland.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign, Henry VIII was preoccupied with more pressing matters in England and on the European Continent, and therefore paid little attention to Ireland.  It was not until he had reigned for a quarter of a century on the throne that he turned his attention to Ireland and then it was primarily due his conflict with the Church over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.  Then Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which invested Henry with spiritual jurisdiction over England and proclaimed him head of the Church of England rather than the Pope.  When the proctors of the clergy refused to agree to this measure, the irate monarch deprived them of the right of voting, confiscated church lands and suppressed monasteries, in some cases shedding the blood of their inmates, in the remaining cases evicting them and making them homeless and poor.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\nFearing Ireland's Catholicism and strategic value for her enemies, Elizabeth consolidated English power in Ireland.\n\nThe [[established church]] in Ireland underwent a period of more radical [[Calvinist]] doctrine than occurred in England. [[James Ussher]] (later [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]) authored the [[Irish Articles]], adopted in 1615. In 1634, the [[Irish Convocation]] adopted the English [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] alongside the Irish Articles.  After the Restoration of 1660, it seems that the Thirty-Nine Articles took precedence; they remain the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.vi.x.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

From this period on, sectarian conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\n\n===Translation of the Bible into Irish===\nThe first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by [[Nicholas Walsh (Bishop of Ossory)|Nicholas Walsh]], [[Bishop of Ossory]], who worked on it until he was murdered in 1585. The work was continued by John Kearny, his assistant, and [[Nehemiah Donellan]], [[Church of Ireland Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]]; it was finally completed by [[William O'Domhnuill]] (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by [[William Bedel]] (1571\u20131642), [[Bishop of Kilmore (Church of Ireland)|Bishop of Kilmore]], who completed his translation within the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], although it was not published until 1680 in a revised version by [[Narcissus Marsh]] (1638\u20131713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell had undertaken a translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664\u20131747) and published in 1712.\n\nThe first translation of the entire Bible that was approved by the church was ''An B\u00edobla Naofa'', supervised by [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta]] at [[Maynooth]] and published in 1981.\n\n==Persecution and Penal Laws==\n\nThe [[Irish Confederate Wars]] resulted in much destruction of church property. Irish Catholics were severely persecuted under [[Oliver Cromwell]], their situation only slightly improving under the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings. The land settlements in the aftermath of these wars, and the defeat of James II in 1691, reduced Irish Catholic freeholders to a fraction of their previous size. The introduction of the [[Penal Laws]] further proscribed the practise of Roman Catholicism, with many priests and bishops forced into hiding or exile. Not until the 1770s did the religious climate relax, somewhat.\n\n==Protestant ascendancy (1691\u20131801)==\n{{Main article|Ireland 1691\u20131801}}\n\nBefore the Stuart accession, Ireland was divided into thirty-four [[borough]]s. In 1613, forty new boroughs were created, all of them dominated by Protestants.  The consequence of this was the reduction of the Catholic majority in the Irish parliament to a minority.  By the end of the seventeenth century all Catholics, representing some 85% of Ireland's population then, were banned from the Irish parliament. As a result, political power rested entirely in the hands of a British settler-colonial, and more specifically [[Anglican]], minority while the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] population suffered severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|political and economic privations]].\n\nBy the late 18th century, many of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[ruling class]] had come to see Ireland as their native country. A Parliamentary faction led by [[Henry Grattan]] agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with England and for greater legislative independence for the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals to [[Catholic Emancipation|enfranchise Irish Catholics]]. This was enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet enter parliament or become government officials.\n\n===Oath of Allegiance===\nBy the [[Treaty of Limerick]] the Catholic soldiers of King James were pardoned, protected against forfeiture of their estates, and were free to go abroad if they chose. All Catholics might substitute an oath of allegiance for the oath of supremacy, and were to have such privileges \"as were consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles II\". King William also promised to have the Irish Parliament grant a further relaxation of the penal laws in force. This treaty, however, was soon torn to shreds, and in spite of William's appeals the Irish Parliament refused to ratify it, and embarked on fresh penal legislation. Under these new laws Catholics were excluded from Parliament, from the bench and bar, from the army and navy, from all civil offices, from the corporations, and even from the corporate towns. They could not have Catholic schools at home or attend foreign schools, or inherit landed property, or hold land under lease, or act as executors or administrators, or have arms or ammunition, or a horse worth \u00a35. Neither could they bury their dead in Catholic ruins, or make pilgrimages to holy wells, or observe Catholic holidays. They could not intermarry with the Protestants, the clergyman assisting at such marriages being liable to death. The wife of a Catholic landlord turning Protestant got separate maintenance; the son turning Protestant got the whole estate; and the Catholic landlord having only Catholic children was obliged at death to divide his estate among his children in equal shares. All the [[regular clergy]], as well as bishops and vicars-general should quit the kingdom. The [[secular clergy]] might remain, but must be registered, nor could they have on their churches either steeple or bell.\n\nIn 1728, the Catholics outnumbered Protestants 5 to 1. A few Catholics managed to hold their estates with the collaboration of friendly Protestants; the remainder gradually sank to the level of [[Cotter (farmer)|cottiers]] and day-labourers, reduced to a standard of living far below what they had been used to. Many Catholics chose to emigrate in the hopes of finding a more congenial environment.\n\n===Irish Parliament and the Passing of Tolerance===\nIn the Irish Parliament meanwhile a spirit of independence appeared. As the Parliament of the Pale it had been so often used for factious purposes that in 1496 [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was passed, providing that henceforth no Irish Parliament could meet, and no law could be proposed, without the previous consent of both the [[Irish Privy Council|Irish]] and [[Privy Council of England|English Privy Council]]s. Further, the English Parliament claimed the right to legislate for Ireland; and in the laws prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle (1665), and Irish woollen manufactures (1698), and that dealing with the Irish forfeited estates (1700), it asserted its supposed right.\n\nWhen one member, Molyneux, protested, the English Parliament condemned him, and ordered his book to be burned by the common hangman. Moreover, it passed [[Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719|an Act in 1719]] expressly declaring that it had power to legislate for Ireland, taking away also the appellate jurisdiction of the [[Irish House of Lords]]. The fight made by Swift against Wood's halfpence showed that, though Molyneux was dead, his spirit lived; Lucas continued the fight, and [[Henry Grattan|Grattan]] in [[Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782|1782 obtained legislative independence]].\n\nIn 1778 by an Act enabling Catholics to hold all lands under lease; and in 1782 by a further Act allowing them to erect Catholic schools, with the permission of the Protestant bishop of the diocese, to own a horse worth more than \u00a35, and to assist at Mass without being compelled to accuse the officiating priest. Nor were Catholic bishops any longer compelled to quit the kingdom, nor Catholic children specially rewarded if they turned Protestant. Not for ten years was there any further concession, and then an Act was passed allowing Catholics to erect schools without seeking Protestant permission, admitting Catholics to the Bar, and legalizing marriages between Protestants and Catholics. Much more important was the Act of 1793 giving the Catholics the Parliamentary and municipal franchise, admitting them to the universities and to military and civil offices, and removing all restrictions in regard to the tenure of land. They were still excluded from Parliament, from the inner Bar, and from a few of the higher civil and military offices.\n\nAlways in favour of religious liberty, Grattan would have swept away every vestige of the Penal code. But, in 1782, he mistakenly thought that his work was done when legislative independence was conceded. He forgot that the executive was still left independent of Parliament, answerable only to the English ministry; and that, with rotten boroughs controlled by a few great families, with an extremely limited franchise in the counties, and with pensioners and [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] filling so many seats, the Irish Parliament was but a mockery of representation.\n\nLike Grattan, [[Henry Flood|Flood]] and Charlemont favoured Parliamentary reform, but, unlike him, they were opposed to Catholic concessions. As for Foster and Fitzgibbon, who led the forces of corruption and bigotry, they opposed every attempt at reform, and consented to the Act of 1793 only under strong pressure from [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Dundas]]. These English ministers, alarmed at the progress of [[French revolution]]ary principles in Ireland, fearing a foreign invasion, wished to have the Catholics contented. In 1795 further concessions seemed imminent. In that year an illiberal [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|viceroy]], [[John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Westmoreland]], was replaced by the liberal-minded [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], who came understanding it to be the wish of Pitt that the Catholic claims were to be conceded. He at once dismissed from office a rapacious office-holder named [[John Beresford (statesman)|Beresford]], so powerful that he was called the \"King of Ireland\"; he refused to consult [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland|Lord Chancellor]] [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Fitzgibbon]] or [[John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel|Foster]], the Speaker; he took Grattan and [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|Ponsonby]] into his confidence, and declared his intention to support Grattan's bill admitting Catholics to Parliament. The high hopes raised by these events were dashed to the earth when Fitzwilliam was suddenly recalled, after having been allowed to go so far without any protest from [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Portland]], the home secretary, or from the premier, Pitt. The latter, disliking the Irish Parliament because it had rejected his commercial propositions in 1785, and disagreed with him on the regency in 1789, already mediated a legislative union, and felt that the admission of Catholics to Parliament would thwart his plans. He was probably also influenced by Beresford, who had powerful friends in England, and by [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], whom Fitzgibbon had mischievously convinced that to admit Catholics to Parliament would be to violate his coronation oath. Possibly, other causes concurred with these to bring about the sudden and disastrous change which filled Catholic Ireland with grief, and the whole nation with dismay.\n\nThe new viceroy, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], was instructed to conciliate the Catholic bishops by setting up a Catholic college for the training of Irish priests; this was done by the establishment of [[Maynooth College]]. But he was to set his face against all Parliamentary reform and all Catholic concessions. These things he did with a will. He at once restored Beresford to office and Foster and Fitzgibbon to favour, the latter being made Earl of Clare. And he stirred up but too successfully the dying embers of sectarian hate, with the result that the Ulster factions, the Protestant \"[[Peep-of-Day Boys]]\" and the Catholic \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\", became embittered with a change of names. The latter, turning to republican and revolutionary ways, joined the [[United Irish Society]]; the former became merged in the recently{{when|date=January 2011}} formed [[Orange Institution|Orange Society]], taking its name from William of Orange and having Protestant ascendancy and hatred of Catholicism as its battle cries. Extending from Ulster, these rival societies brought into the other provinces the curse of sectarian strife. Instead of putting down both, the Government took sides with the Orangemen; and, while their lawless acts were condoned, the Catholics were hunted down. An Arms' Act, an Insurrection Act, an Indemnity Act, a suspension of the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] placed them outside the pale of law. An undisciplined soldiery, recruited from the Orange lodges, were then let loose among them. Martial law, free quarters, flogging, picketing, [[half-hanging]], destruction of Catholic property and life, outrages on women followed, until at last Catholic blood was turned into flame. Then [[Wexford Rebellion|Wexford rose]]. Looking back, it now seems certain that, had [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] landed at Bantry in 1796, had even a small force landed at Wexford in 1798, or a few other counties displayed the heroism of Wexford, English power in Ireland would, temporarily at least, have been destroyed. But one county could not fight the British Empire, and the rebellion was soon quenched in blood.\n\nCamden's place was then given to [[Lord Cornwallis]], who came to Ireland for the express purpose of carrying a Legislative Union. Foster refused to support him and joined the opposition. Fitzgibbon, however, aided Cornwallis, and so did [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], who for some time had discharged the duties of chief secretary in the absence of [[Henry Pelham|Mr. Pelham]], and who was now formally appointed to the office. And then began one of the most shameful chapters in Irish history. Even the corrupt Irish Parliament was reluctant to vote away its existence, and in 1799 the opposition was too strong for Castlereagh. But Pitt directed him to persevere, and the great struggle went on. On one side were eloquence and debating power, patriotism, and public virtue, Grattan, Plunket, and Bushe, Foster, Fitzgerald, Ponsonby, and Moore, a truly formidable combination. On the other side were the baser elements of in Parliament, the needy, the spendthrift, the meanly ambitious, operated upon by Castlereagh, with the whole resources of the British Empire at his command. The pensioners and placemen who voted against him at once lost their places and pensions, the military officer was refused promotion, the magistrate was turned off the bench. And while anti-Unionists were unsparingly punished, the Unionists got lavish rewards. The impecunious got well-paid sinecures; the briefless barrister was made a judge or a commissioner; the rich man, ambitious of social distinction, got a peerage, and places and pensions for his friends; and the owners of rotten boroughs to large sums for their interests. The Catholics were promised emancipation in a united Parliament, and in consequence many bishops, some clergy, and a few of the laity supported the Union, not grudging to end an assembly so bigoted and corrupt as the Irish Parliament. By these means Castlereagh triumphed, and in 1801 the United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland opened its doors.\n\n===Catholic Emancipation===\nThe next quarter of a century was a period of unrequited hope. [[Dr. Troy]], the Archbishop of Dublin, had been a strong advocate of the Union, and had induced nine of his brother bishops to concede a veto on episcopal appointments, not uncommon in European monarchies. In return, he wanted [[Catholic Emancipation|Emancipation]] linked with the Union.  Castlereagh was not averse; but Pitt was publicly non-committal and vague, though the Catholic Unionists had no doubt that he favoured linking concession with passage of the Union thereby creating a totally new dispensation for a United Kingdom. Disappointment ensued when nothing was done in the first session of the United Parliament, and it was increased when Pitt resigned office and was succeeded by [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]], the narrow-minded Speaker. Cornwallis, however, assured Dr. Troy that Pitt had resigned, unable to overcome the reluctance of King George III, who believed it contravened the Act of Settlement, and his coronation oath. Pitt declared that he would never again take office if emancipation were not conceded. In spite of this, he became Premier again in 1804, no longer an advocate of emancipation having pledged never again to raise the question in Parliament during the lifetime of the king. To this pledge he was as faithful as he had been false to his former assurances; when [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] presented the Catholic petition in 1805, Pitt opposed it. After 1806, when both Pitt and Fox died, the Catholic champion was Grattan, who had entered the British Parliament in 1805. In the vain hope of conciliating opponents he was willing, in 1808, to concede the veto. Dr. Troy and the higher Catholics acquiesced. The other bishops were unwilling, and rejected  the offer of a state-paid clergy or state-appointed bishops. The agitation of the question, however, did not cease, and for many years it distracted Catholic plans and weakened Catholic effort. Further complications arose when, in 1814, the prefect of the Propaganda, Quarantotti, issued a rescript favouring the veto. He acted, however, beyond his powers in the absence of [[Pius VII]], who was in France. When the Pope returned to Rome, after the fall of [[Napoleon]], the rescript was disavowed.\n\nIn these years the Catholics badly needed a leader. [[John Keogh]], the able leader of 1793, was then old, and Lords Fingall and Gormanstone, Mr. Scully and Dr. Dromgoole, were not the men to grapple with great difficulties and powerful opponents. An abler and more vigorous leader was required, one with less faith in petitions and protestations of loyalty. Such a leader was found in [[Daniel O'Connell]], a Catholic barrister whose first public appearance in 1800 was on an anti-Unionist platform. A great lawyer and orator, a great debater, of boundless courage and resources, he took a prominent part on Catholic committees, and from 1810 he held the first place in Catholic esteem. Yet the Catholic cause advanced slowly, and, when Grattan died in 1820, emancipation had not come. Nor would the House of Lords accept Plunket's Bill of 1821, even though it passed the House of Commons and conceded the veto. At last O'Connell determined to rouse the masses, and in 1823, with the help of [[Richard Lalor Sheil]], he founded the [[Catholic Association]]. Its progress at first was slow, but gradually it gathered strength. [[Daniel Murray (archbishop)|Dr. Murray]], the new Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, joined it, and [[James Warren Doyle|Dr. Doyle]], the great Bishop of Kildare; other bishops followed; the clergy and people also came in; and thus rose a great national organization, supervising from its central office in Dublin subsidiary associations in every parish; maintained by a Catholic rent; watching over local and national affairs, discharging, as Mr. Canning described it, \"all the functions of a regular government, and having obtained a complete mastery and control over the masses of the Irish people\". The Association was suppressed in 1825 by Act of Parliament; but O'Connell merely changed the name; and the New Catholic Association with its New Catholic rent continued the work of agitation as of old. Nor was this all. By the Catholic Relief Act of 1793 the forty-shilling freeholders obtained the franchise. These freeholders were in the power of the landlords. Protected by a powerful association, and encouraged by the priests and by O'Connell, the freeholders broke free. In Waterford, Louth, Meath, and elsewhere they voted for the nominees of the Catholic Association at elections, and humbled the landlords. They returned O'Connell himself for Clare in 1828. The Tory ministers, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Robert Peel|Peel]], steered the passage of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill of 1829]]. The forty-shilling freeholders, however, were temporarily disfranchised, and provisions excluding Catholics from some of the higher civil and military offices, prohibiting priests from wearing vestments outside their churches, bishops from assuming the titles of their sees, and clergy from obtaining charitable bequests. In other respects U.K. Roman Catholics were placed on a level with other denominations, and at last were fully admitted within to the benefits fruits of the constitution.\n\nThe Irish Catholics had several grievances still calling for redress: the [[Church of Ireland|established state Church]], landlordism, and educational inequality. Mr. Gladstone commenced with the Church of Ireland. He introduced [[Irish Church Act 1869|a Bill]] disendowing and disestablishing it. Commissioners were appointed to wind it up, taking charge of its property, then computed at more than \u00a315,000,000. Of this sum, \u00a311,000,000, was given to the disestablished Church, part to the holders of existing offices, part to enable the Church to continue its work. A further sum of nearly \u00a31,000,000 was distributed between Maynooth College, deprived of its annual grant, and the Presbyterian Church deprived of the [[Regium Donum]], the latter getting twice as much as the former. The surplus was to be disposed of by Parliament for such public objects as it might determine.\n\n==Free State and Republic (1922\u2013present)==\n[[Image:Ei-map.svg|right|thumb|Political map of Ireland]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has had a powerful influence over the Irish state since its inception in 1922 although that influence has diminished somewhat in recent decades. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, banning, for example, [[divorce]], [[contraception]], [[abortion]] and [[pornography]] as well as encouraging the censoring of many books and films. In addition the church largely controlled the state's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\n\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.<ref>M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868\u20131966, (1993) p.431</ref> By the 1960s, the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as  British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as ''[[Ne Temere]]'', whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics.\n\n==Sexual abuse scandals==\n\nSince the early 1990s, the church in Ireland has been rocked by many cases of sexual abuse. Enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children in previous decades. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, assisted by senior clergy. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions.\n\nSee [[Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland]] and [[Magdalene asylum]]\n\n==Influence on Irish society==\n\n===Ireland===\n\n====Politics====\nIn the [[Irish Free State]], now [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the church had a great influence on public opinion as it had supervised public education for about 90% of the population since at least the 1830s. Historically it was associated with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] movement until 1766, and with [[Irish nationalism]] after [[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in 1829. The church was resurgent between 1829 and the disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1869\u201371, when its most significant leaders included [[Bishop James Doyle]], [[Cardinal Cullen]] and [[John MacHale|Archbishop MacHale]]. The hierarchy supported the democratic and mainly non-violent [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the 1880s, and its offshoots, and the policy of [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish Home Rule]] in 1886\u20131920. It did not support the [[Irish republican]] movement until 1921, as it espoused violence, in spite of support from many individual priests, and opposed the anti-Treaty side in the [[Irish Civil War]]. Despite this relative moderation, Irish Protestants were concerned that a self-governing Ireland would result in \"[[Rome Rule]]\" instead of home rule, and this became an element in the creation of [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nMajor popular church events attended by the political world have included the [[Eucharistic Congress]] in 1932 and the [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|Papal Visit]] in 1979. The last prelate with strong social and political interests was [[John Charles McQuaid|Archbishop McQuaid]], who retired in 1972.\n\n====Education====\nAfter independence in 1922, the Church remained heavily involved in health care and education, raising money and running institutions which were staffed by Catholic [[religious institute]]s, largely because the new state remained impoverished. Its main political effect was to continue to run schools where religious education was a major element. The hierarchy opposed the free public secondary schools service introduced in 1968 by [[Donogh O'Malley]], in part because they ran almost all such schools. Some have argued that the church's strong efforts since the 1830s to continue the control of Catholic education was primarily to guarantee a continuing source of candidates for the priesthood, as they would have years of training before entering a seminary.<ref>E. Brian Titley \"''Church, State and the control of schooling in Ireland 1900\u20131944''\"; McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, New York 1983.</ref>\n\n====Health care====\nFrom 1930 hospitals were funded by a [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake|sweepstake]] (lottery) with tickets frequently distributed or sold by nuns or priests{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  On health matters it was seen as unsympathetic to women's needs and in 1950 it opposed the [[Mother and Child Scheme]].\n\n====Morality and censorship====\nIt helped reinforce public [[censorship]] and maintained its own list of banned literature which influenced the State's list. Divorce allowing remarriage was banned in 1924 (though it had been rare), and selling artificial contraception was made illegal. The Church's influence slipped somewhat after 1970, impacted partly by the media and the growing [[feminist]] movement. For instance the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979]] showed the ability of the Catholic Church to force the government into a compromise situation over artificial [[contraception]], though unable to get the result it wanted; contraception could now be bought, but only with a prescription from a doctor and supplied only by registered chemists. In the 1983 Amendment to the [[Irish constitution|constitution]] introduced the constitutional prohibition of [[abortion]], which the Church supported, though abortion for social reasons remains illegal under Irish statute law. However the Church failed to influence the  June 1996, removal of the constitutional prohibition of divorce. While the church had opposed divorce allowing remarriage in civil law, its [[canon law]] allowed for a law of [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]] and a limited divorce \"''a mensa et thoro''\", effectively a form of marital separation.  In a further repudiation of the church's teaching, on 22 May 2015, 62% of Irish voters approved the legalization of [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|same sex marriage]] in Ireland.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act of 1920]] acted as the constitution of [[Northern Ireland]], in which was enshrined freedom of religion for all of Northern Ireland's citizens.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/goi231220.htm#1\n| title = The Constitution of Northern Ireland being the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as amended (Clause 5)\n| accessdate = 13 February 2007\n| author = His Majesty's Government\n| date = 23 December 1920\n| work = Government of Ireland Act, 1920\n| publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1956\n}}</ref> Here Roman Catholics formed a minority of some 35% of the population, which had mostly supported Irish nationalism and was therefore historically opposed to the creation of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Roman Catholic schools' council was at first resistant in accepting the role of the government of Northern Ireland, and initially accepted funding only from the government of the [[Irish Free State]] and admitting no school inspectors. Thus it was that the [[Sir Robert Lynn|Lynn]] Committee presented a report to the government, from which an Education Bill was created to update the education system in Northern Ireland, without any co-operation from the Roman Catholic section in education. Instead, in regard to the Roman Catholic schools, the report relied on the guidance of a Roman Catholic who was to become the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Education \u2014 [[Andrew Nicholas Bonaparte Wyse|A. N. Bonaparte Wyse]].\n\n{{Cquote|We hope that, notwithstanding the disadvantage at which we were placed by this action, it will be found that Roman Catholic interests have not suffered. We have throughout been careful to keep in mind and to make allowance for the particular points of view of Roman Catholics in regard to education so far as known to us, and it has been our desire to refrain as far as we could from recommending any course which might be thought to be contrary to their wishes.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Morrison\n | first = John\n | title = The Ulster Cover-Up\n | year = 1993\n | publisher = Ulster Society (Publications)\n | location = [[Northern Ireland]]\n | isbn =1-872076-15-7\n | chapter = The Ulster Government and Internal Opposition\n | page = 40\n }}</ref>|20px|20px|Lynn Commission report, 1923}}\n\nMany commentators have suggested that the separate education systems in Northern Ireland after 1921 prolonged the sectarian divisions in that community. Cases of [[gerrymandering]] and preference in public services for non-Catholics led to the need for a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in 1967.\n\n===Vatican II===\nIn both parts of Ireland Church policy and practice changed markedly after the [[Vatican II]] reforms of 1962. Probably the largest change was that [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] could be said in [[vernacular]] languages and not in [[Latin]], and in 1981 the Church commissioned its first edition of the [[Bible]] in [[Irish language|Irish]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catholic Church in Ireland]]\n* [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|title=History of the Christian Church, Volume IV:Mediavel christianity.

She was built by the naval shipyard in [[Pula|Pola]]; she was laid down in March 1855, was launched in October 1858, and was completed the following year. The ship took part in the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864, but saw no action during her deployment to the [[North Sea]]. ''Kaiser'' did see action during the [[Seven Weeks' War]] two years later, during which she took part in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] as the [[flagship]] of [[Anton von Petz]], commander of the Austrian 2nd Division. ''Kaiser'' engaged several Italian ironclads simultaneously, rammed one\u2014{{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}}\u2014and damaged another\u2014{{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}\u2014with gunfire. In doing so, she became the only wooden ship of the line to engage an [[ironclad warship]] in battle.\n\nIn 1869, the Austro-Hungarians decided to rebuild ''Kaiser'' into an ironclad [[casemate ship]]; the work lasted until 1873, and was delayed significantly by budget shortfalls, which slowed the acquisition of armor plate from British firms. By this time, however, casemate ships were being superseded by [[turret ship]]s, and as a result, ''Kaiser'' spent the years 1875\u20131902 in reserve. She was nevertheless modernized periodically throughout the 1870s and 1880s in attempts to improve her performance. In 1901\u20131902, she was renamed '''''Bellona''''' and had her armament and engines removed so she could be used as a [[barracks ship]] in Pola, a role she filled through [[World War I]]. Italy seized the ship as a [[war prize]] after the end of the conflict, but her ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n==Design==\nStarting in the early 1850s, the [[Austrian Empire]], faced with a strengthening [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]\u2014which unified most of the Italian peninsula in a decade\u2014began to modernize its navy with new steam-driven warships. [[Archduke]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian]] oversaw the program, which began with the screw [[frigate]] {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} laid down in Britain in 1852. Two years later, Ferdinand decided a steam [[ship of the line]] should be built next; he originally intended the new ship would be built as a copy of the British 91-gun ship of the line {{HMS|Agamemnon|1852|6}}, the plans for which the [[Royal Navy]] provided to Austria in exchange for the country remaining neutral during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u20131856. The excellent performance of the French ship {{ship|French ship|Alg\u00e9siras|1855|2}} during the war prompted the Austrians to modify the ''Agamemnon'' design to incorporate features of the French vessel, including a greater size and more powerful machinery. A second vessel of a slightly larger design, to have been named ''\u00d6sterreich'' and armed with 101 guns, was cancelled in 1859 before she was [[keel laying|laid down]].<ref>Lambert, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nFigures for ''Kaiser''{{'}}s original characteristics are unclear. According to the contemporary historian Wilhelm von R\u00fcstow, ''Kaiser'' was {{convert|242|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} long, with a [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|5337|LT}}.<ref name=R670/> But the modern naval historian Andrew Lambert states her length was {{convert|242|ft|10|in|order=flip}} on {{convert|5194|LT}}. He also provides a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|53|ft|2|in|order=flip}}.<ref name=L147>Lambert, p. 147</ref> Her crew numbered some 900&nbsp;officers and men, which included a contingent of naval [[infantry]]. She was armed with a battery of ninety-two guns, consisting of sixteen 60-pounder guns, seventy-four 30-pounder [[smoothbore]]s, and two 24-pounder [[breech loader]]s.<ref name=R670>R\u00fcstow, p. 670</ref> The ship was powered by a two-cylinder horizontal [[steam engine]], which drove a single [[screw propeller]] that was {{convert|5.75|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. Steam was provided by six coal-fired [[boiler]]s with twenty-six [[firebox (steam engine)|fireboxes]]. The engine, which was manufactured by [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]], was rated at 800&nbsp;[[nominal horsepower]]. A three-[[mast (sailing)|masted]] [[ship rig]] supplemented the steam engine.<ref name=G270/><ref>Lambert, pp. 114, 147</ref><ref name=P49/>\n\n==Service history==\nThe [[keel]] of ''Kaiser'' was laid down on 25 March 1855 at the naval shipyard in [[Pula|Pola]];<ref name=G270>Gardiner, p. 270</ref> the ship was launched on 4 October 1858, and commissioned into the Austrian Navy in 1859. She began [[sea trials]] on 6 December that year, with the first trip under her own power taking place from [[Muggia]] to Pola.<ref>Aichelburg, p. 34</ref> In February 1864, the Austrian Empire joined [[Prussia]] in the [[Second Schleswig War]] against Denmark. ''Kaiser'' was sent with the new [[armored frigate]] {{SMS|Juan de Austria||2}} and two smaller vessels under Vice Admiral [[Bernhard von W\u00fcllerstorf-Urbair]] to reinforce a smaller force consisting of the screw frigates {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} and ''Radetzky'' under then-Captain [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]]. After the two groups combined in [[Den Helder]], the Netherlands, they proceeded to [[Cuxhaven]] on 27 June, arriving three days later. The now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port for the rest of the war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadron. Instead, the Austrian and Prussian naval forces supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast.<ref>Greene & Massignani, pp. 210\u2013211</ref> During the campaign, ''Kaiser'' was commanded by [[Friedrich von P\u00f6ck]].<ref>Sondhaus, p. 36</ref>\n\n===Battle of Lissa===\n{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}\n[[File:Ludwig Rubelli von Sturmfest Die Schlacht bei Lissa.jpg|left|thumb|''Kaiser'' surrounded by Italian ironclads at Lissa]]\n\nIn June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], which was fought concurrently with the [[Austro-Prussian War]].<ref name=S1>Sondhaus, p. 1</ref> Tegetthoff, by now promoted to Rear Admiral and given command of the entire fleet, brought the Austrian fleet to [[Ancona]] on 27 June, in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], refused to engage Tegetthoff.<ref>Wilson, pp. 216\u2013218</ref> At the time, ''Kaiser'' served as the [[flagship]] of the 2nd Division of the Austrian fleet, under the command of Baron [[Anton von Petz]].<ref>Sondhaus, p. 2</ref> On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, bound for the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought [[troop transport]]s carrying 3,000 soldiers.<ref name=S1/> Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing.<ref>Wilson, pp. 221\u2013224</ref> Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and [[Venice]]. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack.<ref>Wilson, pp. 229\u2013230</ref>\n\nAs Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians.<ref>Wilson, pp. 223\u2013225</ref> Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, with the wooden warships of the 2nd and 3rd Divisions following behind in the same formation. ''Kaiser'' led the 2nd Division at the center of the line.<ref>Wilson, pp. 230\u2013231</ref> While he was forming up his ships, Persano transferred from his flagship, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, to the [[turret ship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}. This created a gap in the Italian [[line of battle|line]], and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a [[melee]]. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt.<ref>Wilson, pp. 232\u2013235</ref> In the meantime, Petz took ''Kaiser'' and his division further south, hoping to attack the Italian wooden ships that had not joined the action. Instead, the rear of the Italian ironclad line turned to block Petz from Tegetthoff and attacked ''Kaiser''.<ref>Wilson, pp. 234\u2013236</ref> Petz in turn reoriented his division to attack the Italian ironclads, leading the charge with ''Kaiser''.<ref>Wilson, p. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:Kaiser (ship, 1859) - NH 87011.jpg|thumb|''Kaiser'' after the battle, partially [[Dismasting|dismasted]]]]\n\nThe ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}}, {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Varese||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}} circled around ''Kaiser'', trading broadsides with her. In the ensuing melee, the Austrian and Italian vessels repeatedly attempted to ram each other. Persano arrived in ''Affondatore'' and unsuccessfully tried to ram ''Kaiser'', but missed and struck only a glancing blow. Shortly thereafter, ''Kaiser'' rammed the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}} in an attempt to protect the Austrian unarmored ships {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|2}} and {{SMS|Kaiserin Elizabeth||2}}. ''Kaiser'' also struck a glancing blow, however, and inflicted little damage. ''Re di Portogallo'' fired her light guns into the ship in response, starting a fire, and killing or wounding a number of Austrian gunners before ''Kaiser'' could break free. ''Affondatore'' then made a second, unsuccessful attempt to ram ''Kaiser''. Though she missed with her [[naval ram|ram]], ''Affondatore'' did score a hit with one of her guns, badly damaging ''Kaiser'', killing or wounding twenty of her crew.<ref>Wilson, pp. 238\u2013240</ref> In return, ''Kaiser''{{'}}s gunners fired their guns into ''Affondatore''{{'}}s deck, badly holing it and starting a fire, while riflemen in her [[fighting top]]s shot at Italian sailors.<ref>Wilson, p. 244</ref> In addition, a shot from ''Kaiser'' struck one of ''Affondatore''{{'}}s turrets, jamming it for the remainder of the battle.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 43</ref> ''Kaiser'' had lost her foremast and funnel in the collision with ''Re di Portogallo'', and Petz ordered his damaged ship to put into port at Lissa.<ref>Paine, p. 55</ref>\n\nBy this time, the Austrian ironclads disengaged from the melee to protect their wooden ships; ''Re d'Italia'' had been rammed and sunk and the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} was burning badly, soon to be destroyed by a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] explosion. Persano made an attempt to follow them with ''Affondatore'', but he broke off the attempt when only one of his other ironclads followed him. His crews were badly demoralized by the loss of ''Re d'Italia'' and ''Palestro'', and his ships were low on ammunition and coal. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.<ref>Wilson, pp. 238\u2013241, 250</ref> In the course of the battle, ''Kaiser''{{'}}s crew had suffered twenty-four killed and thirty-seven wounded.<ref>Wilson, p. 246</ref> ''Kaiser'' was and is the only ship of the line to have engaged ironclad warships in battle.<ref>Sandler, p. 62</ref>\n\n===Conversion and later career===\n[[File:Kaiser (1859) - NH 75928.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaiser'' after her reconstruction into a casemate ship]]\n\nAfter returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the [[Armistice of Cormons]]; this ended the fighting and led to the [[Treaty of Vienna (1866)|Treaty of Vienna]]. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]], the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. As a result, Austria, which became [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'']] of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy.<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 1\u20133</ref> In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 8</ref>\n\nChronic budgetary problems confronted the navy of the new Austro-Hungarian Empire; Tegetthoff had great difficulty securing funding for new ships to modernize the fleet. In 1868, he attempted to start a new building program, but the government refused to budget for new warships. Parliament did include funds to modernize ''Kaiser'', however.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 21</ref> On 2 February 1869, ''Kaiser'' was taken into [[drydock]] and her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was examined. Found to be in good condition, the ship was rebuilt into an ironclad [[casemate ship]]. Old wood planking below the waterline was replaced, but the hull was completely rebuilt with iron above the waterline. Her bow was replaced with a more pronounced ram and she received a new stern as well. This increased her length to {{convert|77.75|m|abbr=on}} at the waterline and increased her beam to {{convert|17.76|m|abbr=on}}. Her draft remained similar, at {{convert|7.37|m|abbr=on}}, though her displacement increased to {{convert|5720|LT}}. Superheaters were added to her original boilers to provide more power, though her top speed fell to {{convert|11.55|kn}} from {{convert|2786|ihp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G270/><ref name=P49/>\n\nThe ship was rearmed with a battery of ten {{convert|9|in|abbr=on}} 23-pounder [[muzzle-loading gun]]s manufactured by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] in a central, two-story casemate. These were supported by a [[secondary battery]] of six 8-pounder [[Rifled Muzzle Loader]]s. An [[armored belt]] was installed on the waterline; in the central citadel that protected the machinery spaces, the belt was {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on|0}} thick. On either end of the ship, the belt was reduced to {{convert|102|mm|abbr=on|0}}. Iron plating {{convert|127|mm|abbr=on|0}} thick protected the [[casemate]]. ''Kaiser'' was re-launched in 1871,<ref name=G270/> but further budgetary problems, particularly payments for the armor plate and iron fittings that were purchased from Britain, delayed completion of the conversion.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 25</ref> Work was finally completed in December 1873.<ref name=G270/> She began [[sea trial]]s on 21 December.<ref name=P49>Pawlik, p. 49</ref> By this time, the ship had become obsolescent; the same year, Italy laid down the two {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|1}}s, very powerful turret ships twice the size of ''Kaiser'' and that carried [[100-ton gun|{{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} guns]].<ref>Gardiner, p. 340</ref>\n\n[[File:Kaiser (1859) - with armour shown.png|thumb|Line drawing of ''Kaiser'' after her reconstruction]]\n\nThe ship did not see further active service, however. She remained [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] from 1875,<ref>Sondhaus, p. 100</ref> spending the first four months of 1876 in the II Reserve, followed by repairs and modifications for the rest of the year.<ref name=P50>Pawlik, p. 50</ref> During this period, naval engineers attempted to improve the ship's performance. In 1876, her original screw was replaced with a larger propeller that was {{convert|7.62|m|abbr=on|0}} in diameter. During speed tests conducted on 7 December, the ship reached {{convert|12.72|kn}}, more than a knot increase in speed.<ref name=P49/> She was immediately returned to the II Reserve. In 1880, the ship had her rigging reduced and received new boilers.<ref name=P50/> A new secondary battery that consisted of six {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} 24-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] (cal.) [[breech-loading gun]]s, two {{convert|7|cm|abbr=on}} 15-cal. guns, four {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} 33-cal. [[quick-firing gun]]s, three 47&nbsp;mm [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss revolver cannon]], and four {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s was installed in 1882. In 1885, three {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s were added, one in the bow and one on each broadside.<ref name=G270/>\n\nA commission examined the ship in 1893 and recommended that the ship was \"not suitable for commissioning\". The government began negotiations with [[Venezuela]] in 1895 to sell ''Kaiser'', but the discussion came to nothing.<ref name=P50/> In 1897, she was stricken from the list of active battleships.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 155</ref> The ship was disarmed in 1901, and the following year had her engines removed so she could be used as a [[barracks ship]] in Pola. She was formally stricken from the [[naval register]] on 4 January 1902, was renamed ''Bellona'', and added to the list of [[hulk (ship)|hulks]]. She served as a barracks ship through [[World War I]]. From 1910 to 1917 the staff of the II Reserve was housed aboard the ship, and in 1918 the naval training school staff was brought aboard as well.

She was built by the naval shipyard in [[Pula|Pola]]; she was laid down in March 1855, was launched in October 1858, and was completed the following year. The ship took part in the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864, but saw no action during her deployment to the [[North Sea]]. ''Kaiser'' did see action during the [[Seven Weeks' War]] two years later, during which she took part in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] as the [[flagship]] of [[Anton von Petz]], commander of the Austrian 2nd Division. ''Kaiser'' engaged several Italian ironclads simultaneously, rammed one\u2014{{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}}\u2014and damaged another\u2014{{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}\u2014with gunfire. In doing so, she became the only wooden ship of the line to engage an [[ironclad warship]] in battle.\n\nIn 1869, the Austro-Hungarians decided to rebuild ''Kaiser'' into an ironclad [[casemate ship]]; the work lasted until 1873, and was delayed significantly by budget shortfalls, which slowed the acquisition of armor plate from British firms. By this time, however, casemate ships were being superseded by [[turret ship]]s, and as a result, ''Kaiser'' spent the years 1875\u20131902 in reserve. She was nevertheless modernized periodically throughout the 1870s and 1880s in attempts to improve her performance. In 1901\u20131902, she was renamed '''''Bellona''''' and had her armament and engines removed so she could be used as a [[barracks ship]] in Pola, a role she filled through [[World War I]]. Italy seized the ship as a [[war prize]] after the end of the conflict, but her ultimate fate is unknown\n\n==Design==\nStarting in the early 1850s, the [[Austrian Empire]], faced with a strengthening [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]\u2014which unified most of the Italian peninsula in a decade\u2014began to modernize its navy with new steam-driven warships. [[Archduke]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian]] oversaw the program, which began with the screw [[frigate]] {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} laid down in Britain in 1852. Two years later, Ferdinand decided a steam [[ship of the line]] should be built next; he originally intended the new ship would be built as a copy of the British 91-gun ship of the line {{HMS|Agamemnon|1852|6}}, the plans for which the [[Royal Navy]] provided to Austria in exchange for the country remaining neutral during the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u20131856. The excellent performance of the French ship {{ship|French ship|Alg\u00e9siras|1855|2}} during the war prompted the Austrians to modify the ''Agamemnon'' design to incorporate features of the French vessel, including a greater size and more powerful machinery. A second vessel of a slightly larger design, to have been named ''\u00d6sterreich'' and armed with 101 guns, was cancelled in 1859 before she was [[keel laying|laid down]].<ref>Lambert, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nFigures for ''Kaiser''{{'}}s original characteristics are unclear. According to the contemporary historian Wilhelm von R\u00fcstow, ''Kaiser'' was {{convert|242|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} long, with a [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|5337|LT}}.<ref name=R670/> But the modern naval historian Andrew Lambert states her length was {{convert|242|ft|10|in|order=flip}} on {{convert|5194|LT}}. He also provides a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|53|ft|2|in|order=flip}}.<ref name=L147>Lambert, p. 147</ref> Her crew numbered some 900&nbsp;officers and men, which included a contingent of naval [[infantry]]. She was armed with a battery of ninety-two guns, consisting of sixteen 60-pounder guns, seventy-four 30-pounder [[smoothbore]]s, and two 24-pounder [[breech loader]]s.<ref name=R670>R\u00fcstow, p. 670</ref> The ship was powered by a two-cylinder horizontal [[steam engine]], which drove a single [[screw propeller]] that was {{convert|5.75|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. Steam was provided by six coal-fired [[boiler]]s with twenty-six [[firebox (steam engine)|fireboxes]]. The engine, which was manufactured by [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]], was rated at 800&nbsp;[[nominal horsepower]]. A three-[[mast (sailing)|masted]] [[ship rig]] supplemented the steam engine.<ref name=G270/><ref>Lambert, pp. 114, 147</ref><ref name=P49/>\n\n==Service history==\nThe [[keel]] of ''Kaiser'' was laid down on 25 March 1855 at the naval shipyard in [[Pula|Pola]];<ref name=G270>Gardiner, p. 270</ref> the ship was launched on 4 October 1858, and commissioned into the Austrian Navy in 1859. She began [[sea trials]] on 6 December that year, with the first trip under her own power taking place from [[Muggia]] to Pola.<ref>Aichelburg, p. 34</ref> In February 1864, the Austrian Empire joined [[Prussia]] in the [[Second Schleswig War]] against Denmark. ''Kaiser'' was sent with the new [[armored frigate]] {{SMS|Juan de Austria||2}} and two smaller vessels under Vice Admiral [[Bernhard von W\u00fcllerstorf-Urbair]] to reinforce a smaller force consisting of the screw frigates {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} and ''Radetzky'' under then-Captain [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]]. After the two groups combined in [[Den Helder]], the Netherlands, they proceeded to [[Cuxhaven]] on 27 June, arriving three days later. The now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port for the rest of the war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadron. Instead, the Austrian and Prussian naval forces supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast.<ref>Greene & Massignani, pp. 210\u2013211</ref> During the campaign, ''Kaiser'' was commanded by [[Friedrich von P\u00f6ck]].<ref>Sondhaus, p. 36</ref>\n\n===Battle of Lissa===\n{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}\n[[File:Ludwig Rubelli von Sturmfest Die Schlacht bei Lissa.jpg|left|thumb|''Kaiser'' surrounded by Italian ironclads at Lissa]]\n\nIn June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], which was fought concurrently with the [[Austro-Prussian War]].<ref name=S1>Sondhaus, p. 1</ref> Tegetthoff, by now promoted to Rear Admiral and given command of the entire fleet, brought the Austrian fleet to [[Ancona]] on 27 June, in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral [[Carlo Pellion di Persano]], refused to engage Tegetthoff.<ref>Wilson, pp. 216\u2013218</ref> At the time, ''Kaiser'' served as the [[flagship]] of the 2nd Division of the Austrian fleet, under the command of Baron [[Anton von Petz]].<ref>Sondhaus, p. 2</ref> On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, bound for the island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], where they arrived on the 18th. With them, they brought [[troop transport]]s carrying 3,000 soldiers.<ref name=S1/> Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing.<ref>Wilson, pp. 221\u2013224</ref> Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and [[Venice]]. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack.<ref>Wilson, pp. 229\u2013230</ref>\n\nAs Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians.<ref>Wilson, pp. 223\u2013225</ref> Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, with the wooden warships of the 2nd and 3rd Divisions following behind in the same formation. ''Kaiser'' led the 2nd Division at the center of the line.<ref>Wilson, pp. 230\u2013231</ref> While he was forming up his ships, Persano transferred from his flagship, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, to the [[turret ship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}. This created a gap in the Italian [[line of battle|line]], and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a [[melee]]. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt.<ref>Wilson, pp. 232\u2013235</ref> In the meantime, Petz took ''Kaiser'' and his division further south, hoping to attack the Italian wooden ships that had not joined the action. Instead, the rear of the Italian ironclad line turned to block Petz from Tegetthoff and attacked ''Kaiser''.<ref>Wilson, pp. 234\u2013236</ref> Petz in turn reoriented his division to attack the Italian ironclads, leading the charge with ''Kaiser''.<ref>Wilson, p. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:Kaiser (ship, 1859) - NH 87011.jpg|thumb|''Kaiser'' after the battle, partially [[Dismasting|dismasted]]]]\n\nThe ironclads {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}}, {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Varese||2}}, and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}} circled around ''Kaiser'', trading broadsides with her. In the ensuing melee, the Austrian and Italian vessels repeatedly attempted to ram each other. Persano arrived in ''Affondatore'' and unsuccessfully tried to ram ''Kaiser'', but missed and struck only a glancing blow. Shortly thereafter, ''Kaiser'' rammed the ironclad {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}} in an attempt to protect the Austrian unarmored ships {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|2}} and {{SMS|Kaiserin Elizabeth||2}}. ''Kaiser'' also struck a glancing blow, however, and inflicted little damage. ''Re di Portogallo'' fired her light guns into the ship in response, starting a fire, and killing or wounding a number of Austrian gunners before ''Kaiser'' could break free. ''Affondatore'' then made a second, unsuccessful attempt to ram ''Kaiser''. Though she missed with her [[naval ram|ram]], ''Affondatore'' did score a hit with one of her guns, badly damaging ''Kaiser'', killing or wounding twenty of her crew.<ref>Wilson, pp. 238\u2013240</ref> In return, ''Kaiser''{{'}}s gunners fired their guns into ''Affondatore''{{'}}s deck, badly holing it and starting a fire, while riflemen in her [[fighting top]]s shot at Italian sailors.<ref>Wilson, p. 244</ref> In addition, a shot from ''Kaiser'' struck one of ''Affondatore''{{'}}s turrets, jamming it for the remainder of the battle.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 43</ref> ''Kaiser'' had lost her foremast and funnel in the collision with ''Re di Portogallo'', and Petz ordered his damaged ship to put into port at Lissa.<ref>Paine, p. 55</ref>\n\nBy this time, the Austrian ironclads disengaged from the melee to protect their wooden ships; ''Re d'Italia'' had been rammed and sunk and the [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} was burning badly, soon to be destroyed by a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] explosion. Persano made an attempt to follow them with ''Affondatore'', but he broke off the attempt when only one of his other ironclads followed him. His crews were badly demoralized by the loss of ''Re d'Italia'' and ''Palestro'', and his ships were low on ammunition and coal. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.<ref>Wilson, pp. 238\u2013241, 250</ref> In the course of the battle, ''Kaiser''{{'}}s crew had suffered twenty-four killed and thirty-seven wounded.<ref>Wilson, p. 246</ref> ''Kaiser'' was and is the only ship of the line to have engaged ironclad warships in battle.<ref>Sandler, p. 62</ref>\n\n===Conversion and later career===\n[[File:Kaiser (1859) - NH 75928.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaiser'' after her reconstruction into a casemate ship]]\n\nAfter returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the [[Armistice of Cormons]]; this ended the fighting and led to the [[Treaty of Vienna (1866)|Treaty of Vienna]]. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]], the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. As a result, Austria, which became [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'']] of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy.<ref>Sondhaus, pp. 1\u20133</ref> In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 8</ref>\n\nChronic budgetary problems confronted the navy of the new Austro-Hungarian Empire; Tegetthoff had great difficulty securing funding for new ships to modernize the fleet. In 1868, he attempted to start a new building program, but the government refused to budget for new warships. Parliament did include funds to modernize ''Kaiser'', however.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 21</ref> On 2 February 1869, ''Kaiser'' was taken into [[drydock]] and her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was examined. Found to be in good condition, the ship was rebuilt into an ironclad [[casemate ship]]. Old wood planking below the waterline was replaced, but the hull was completely rebuilt with iron above the waterline. Her bow was replaced with a more pronounced ram and she received a new stern as well. This increased her length to {{convert|77.75|m|abbr=on}} at the waterline and increased her beam to {{convert|17.76|m|abbr=on}}. Her draft remained similar, at {{convert|7.37|m|abbr=on}}, though her displacement increased to {{convert|5720|LT}}. Superheaters were added to her original boilers to provide more power, though her top speed fell to {{convert|11.55|kn}} from {{convert|2786|ihp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G270/><ref name=P49/>\n\nThe ship was rearmed with a battery of ten {{convert|9|in|abbr=on}} 23-pounder [[muzzle-loading gun]]s manufactured by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] in a central, two-story casemate. These were supported by a [[secondary battery]] of six 8-pounder [[Rifled Muzzle Loader]]s. An [[armored belt]] was installed on the waterline; in the central citadel that protected the machinery spaces, the belt was {{convert|152|mm|abbr=on|0}} thick. On either end of the ship, the belt was reduced to {{convert|102|mm|abbr=on|0}}. Iron plating {{convert|127|mm|abbr=on|0}} thick protected the [[casemate]]. ''Kaiser'' was re-launched in 1871,<ref name=G270/> but further budgetary problems, particularly payments for the armor plate and iron fittings that were purchased from Britain, delayed completion of the conversion.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 25</ref> Work was finally completed in December 1873.<ref name=G270/> She began [[sea trial]]s on 21 December.<ref name=P49>Pawlik, p. 49</ref> By this time, the ship had become obsolescent; the same year, Italy laid down the two {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|1}}s, very powerful turret ships twice the size of ''Kaiser'' and that carried [[100-ton gun|{{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} guns]].<ref>Gardiner, p. 340</ref>\n\n[[File:Kaiser (1859) - with armour shown.png|thumb|Line drawing of ''Kaiser'' after her reconstruction]]\n\nThe ship did not see further active service, however. She remained [[:wikt:laid up|laid up]] from 1875,<ref>Sondhaus, p. 100</ref> spending the first four months of 1876 in the II Reserve, followed by repairs and modifications for the rest of the year.<ref name=P50>Pawlik, p. 50</ref> During this period, naval engineers attempted to improve the ship's performance. In 1876, her original screw was replaced with a larger propeller that was {{convert|7.62|m|abbr=on|0}} in diameter. During speed tests conducted on 7 December, the ship reached {{convert|12.72|kn}}, more than a knot increase in speed.<ref name=P49/> She was immediately returned to the II Reserve. In 1880, the ship had her rigging reduced and received new boilers.<ref name=P50/> A new secondary battery that consisted of six {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} 24-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] (cal.) [[breech-loading gun]]s, two {{convert|7|cm|abbr=on}} 15-cal. guns, four {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} 33-cal. [[quick-firing gun]]s, three 47&nbsp;mm [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss revolver cannon]], and four {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]]s was installed in 1882. In 1885, three {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s were added, one in the bow and one on each broadside.<ref name=G270/>\n\nA commission examined the ship in 1893 and recommended that the ship was \"not suitable for commissioning\". The government began negotiations with [[Venezuela]] in 1895 to sell ''Kaiser'', but the discussion came to nothing.<ref name=P50/> In 1897, she was stricken from the list of active battleships.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 155</ref> The ship was disarmed in 1901, and the following year had her engines removed so she could be used as a [[barracks ship]] in Pola. She was formally stricken from the [[naval register]] on 4 January 1902, was renamed ''Bellona'', and added to the list of [[hulk (ship)|hulks]]. She served as a barracks ship through [[World War I]]. From 1910 to 1917 the staff of the II Reserve was housed aboard the ship, and in 1918 the naval training school staff was brought aboard as well.

{"title_page": "Sociobiological theories of rape", "text_new": "{{short description|Theories about how evolutionary adaptation influences the psychology of rapists}}\n{{Criminology and penology}}\n{{Rape}}\n\n'''Sociobiological theories of rape''' explore how [[evolution]]ary adaptation influences the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider [[rape]] to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, or scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary to develop effective preventive measures.\n\n== ''A Natural History of Rape'' ==\nThe idea that rape evolved under some circumstances as a genetically advantageous behavioral adaptation was popularized by biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Craig T. Palmer]] in their book ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000).\n\n== Animal coercive sex ==\n{{Further|Sexual coercion|Sexual selection|Sexual conflict}}\nIt has been noted that behavior resembling [[rape]] in humans is observed in the animal kingdom, including [[Anatidae|ducks and geese]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, [[bottlenose dolphins]],<ref>Connor, Richard and Vollmer, Nicole (ed.

Demonic males. New York: Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Such behaviors, referred to as 'forced copulations', involve an animal being approached and [[sexual intercourse|sexually penetrated]] as it struggles or attempts to escape. These observations of forced sex among animals are not controversial. What is controversial is the interpretation of these observations and the extension of theories based on them to [[human]]s. \"Thornhill introduces this theory by describing the sexual behavior of scorpionflies. In which the male may gain sex from the female either by presenting a gift of food during courtship or without a nuptial offering, in which case force is necessary to restrain her.\"<ref name=Glenn>Wilson, Glenn. The Science of Sex: Glenn Wilson on Rape. The Great Sex Divide, pp. 128\u2013131. http://www.heretical.com/wilson/rape.html</ref>\n\n== Human rape ==\n\nIt is hypothesized that rape is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to similar behavior in other animals.  \"Human rape appears not as an aberration but as an alternative gene-promotion strategy that is most likely to be adopted by the 'losers' in the competitive, harem-building struggle. If the means of access to legitimate, consenting sex is not available, then a male may be faced with the choice between force or genetic extinction.\"<ref name=Glenn/>\n\nThornhill and Palmer write that \"In short, a man can have many children, with little inconvenience to himself; a woman can have only a few, and with great effort.\" Females therefore tend to be more selective with partners. Rape is seen as one potential strategy for males for achieving reproductive success. They point to several other factors indicating that rape may be a reproductive strategy. It is during the potentially childbearing years that women most often are rape victims. Rapists usually do not use more force than necessary to subdue their victims which is argued to be the case since physically injuring the victims would reduce the chance of reproduction. Furthermore, \"In many cultures rape is treated as a crime against the victim's husband.\"<ref name=Thornhill2000/>\n\nAnthropologist Edward H. Hagen states in his Evolutionary Psychology FAQ from 2002 that he believes there is no clear evidence for the hypothesis that rape is adaptive. He believes the adaptivity of rape is ''possible'', but claims there is not enough evidence to be certain one way or the other. However, he encourages such evidence to be obtained: \"Whether human males possess psychological adaptations for rape will only be answered by careful studies seeking evidence for such cognitive specializations. To not seek such evidence is like failing to search a suspect for a concealed weapon.\" He also describes some conditions in the ancestral environment during which the reproductive gains from rape may have outweighed the costs:\n*\"High status males may have been able to coerce matings with little fear of reprisal.\"\n*\"Low status women (e.g., orphans) may have been particularly vulnerable to being raped because males need not have feared reprisals from the woman's family.\"\n*\"During war, raping enemy women may have had few negative repercussions.\"\n*\"Men who were low status, who were likely to remain low status, and who had few opportunities to invest in kin may have realized reproductive benefits that outweighed the considerable costs (e.g., reprisal by the woman's family).\"<ref>[http://human.projects.anth.ucsb.edu/epfaq/evpsychfaq_full.html#rape Is rape an adaptation?]</ref>\n\nMcKibbin et al. (2008) argue that there may be several different types of rapists or rape strategies. One is rape by disadvantaged men who cannot get sex otherwise. Another is \"specialized rapists\" who are more sexually aroused from rape than from consensual sex. A third type is opportunistic rapists who switch between forced and consensual sex depending on circumstances. A fourth type is [[psychopathic]] rapists. A fifth type is partner rape due to [[sperm competition]] when the male suspects or knows that the female has had sex with another male. There are varying degrees of empirical support for the existence of each of these types. More generally they mention research finding that at least one-third of males \"admit they would rape under specific conditions\" and that other surveys find that many men{{quantify|date=January 2012}} state having coercive sexual fantasies. They, as have others, \"propose that rape is a conditional strategy that may potentially be deployed by any man.\"<ref name=McKibbin/>\n\n=== Women's defenses ===\nWomen may have developed several defenses against and strategies to avoid rape. One is a partner preference for men that are effective bodyguards against other men such as physically and socially dominant men (although there may also be other evolutionary reasons for such a preference). Another is great psychological pain which according to some research is greatest during the childbearing years. Other researchers{{who|date=May 2013}} have argued that the emotional pain may cause the women to focus on the social circumstances that enabled the rape with the aim to prevent future rapes.\n\nOther research has found that during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle women perform fewer behaviors that may increase the risk of an assault.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/article/view/42|title=Risk taking and Women's Menstrual Cycle: Near Ovulation, Women Avoid a Doubtful Man|last=Nicolas|first=Gu\u00e9guen|date=2012|journal=Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science|volume=3|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.5178/lebs.2012.17|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> Studies have also found that sensitivity for potential coercive behaviors in males as well as handgrip strength (but only in a simulated coercive situation) increase during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.<ref name=McKibbin/>  On the other hand, a 2003 study found that the frequency of [[pregnancy from rape]] is significantly higher than that of pregnancy in non-coercive intercourse, and advanced the hypothesis that male rapists disproportionately target women exhibiting biological indications of fertility.<ref name=Gottschall03>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1014-0 |pmid=26189986 |title=Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates? |year=2003 |last1=Gottschall |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Gottschall |first2=Tiffani A. |journal=Human Nature |volume=14 |pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\n=== Naturalistic fallacy ===\nThornhill and Palmer write that \"Rape is viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage\". They further state that by categorizing a behavior as \"natural\" and \"biological\" they do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. \"Biological\" means \"of or pertaining to life,\" so the word applies to every human feature and behavior. But to infer from that, as many critics assert that Thornhill and Palmer do, that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so-called [[naturalistic fallacy]]. They make a comparison to \"natural disasters as epidemics, floods and tornadoes\". This shows that what can be found in nature is not always good and that measures should be and are taken against natural phenomena. They further argue that a good knowledge of the causes of rape, including evolutionary ones, are necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures.<ref name=Thornhill2000>{{cite web|last1=Thornhill|first1=Randy|last2=Palmer|first2=Craig T.|title=Why Men Rape|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/merlinos/thornhill.html|website=www.csus.edu|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=2000}}</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists McKibbin et al. argue that the claim that evolutionary theories are justifying rape is a fallacy in the same way that it would be a fallacy to accuse scientists doing research on the causes of [[cancer]], that they are justifying cancer. Instead, they say that understanding the causes of rape may help create preventive measures.<ref name=McKibbin>{{Cite journal | last1 = McKibbin | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Shackelford | first2 = T.

(2003) argue that evolutionary psychologists like Thornhill and Palmer use the [[naturalistic fallacy]] inappropriately to forestall legitimate discussion about the ethical implications of their theory. According to Thornhill and Palmer, a naturalistic fallacy is to infer ethical conclusions (e.g., rape is good) from (true or false) statements of fact (e.g., rape is natural). Wilson et al. point out that combining a factual statement with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion is standard ethical reasoning, not a naturalistic fallacy, because the moral judgment is not deduced ''exclusively'' from the factual statement. They further argue that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's factual premise that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. state that Thornhill and Palmer dismiss all ethical objections with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' although \"it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way.\"<ref name=\"wilson2003\">{{cite journal |last1= Wilson |first1= David Sloan |last2= Dietrich |first2= Eric |last3= Clark |first3= Anne B. |year= 2003 |title= On the inappropriate use of the naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary psychology |journal= Biology and Philosophy |volume= 18 |issue= 5 |pages= 669&ndash;681 |doi= 10.1023/A:1026380825208 |url= http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150415084544/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |archivedate= 15 April 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Preventing rape ===\nThornhill and Palmer (2000) suggest a number of possible strategies for preventing rape. One example is explaining to males that they may have predispositions to misread the female invitation of sex. They believe that viewing rape as being due to a desire for domination, and not related to sexual desire, is generally harmful. One example being the claim that the way women dress will not affect the risk of rape. They argue that the much greater societal freedom of dating without supervision, and removal of many barriers between males and females, have created an environment that has also removed many earlier societal controls against rape. It is recommended that \"men and women interact only in public places during the early stages of their relationships\".<ref name=Thornhill2000/>\n\n=== Victim counseling ===\nCounseling of rape victims may also be improved by evolutionary considerations, according to Thornhill and Palmer, and they argue that the view that rape is due to a domination desire, cannot explain to the victim why the rapist seemed to be sexually motivated.\n\nEvolutionary considerations can also help explain the emotional pain felt, as well as the form it takes. They may also help the rape victim understand why the rape victim's partner may see the rape as a form of [[infidelity]]. They also argued that the victim's partner may be helped by such understanding, and be more able to change his or her reaction.<ref name=Thornhill2000/>\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{See also|Criticism of evolutionary psychology}}\nThe 2003 book ''Evolution, Gender, and Rape'', written in response to ''A Natural History of Rape'', compiles the views of twenty-eight scholars in opposition to sociobiological theories of rape. One contributor, [[Michael Kimmel]], criticizes Thornhill and Palmer's argument that female rape victims tend to be sexually attractive young women, rather than children or older women, contrary to what would be expected if rapists selected victims based on inability to resist. Kimmel argues that younger women are the least likely to be married and the most likely to be out on dates with men, and therefore are the most likely to be raped because of opportunity arising from social exposure and marital status.<ref>{{cite book|title= Evolution, Gender, and Rape |isbn= 0-262-20143-7 |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2003 |editor1-last= Travis |editor1-first= Cheryl Brown |last= Kimmel |first= Michael |authorlink1= Michael Kimmel |chapter= An Unnatural History of Rape |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a2TTPKFUXgkC&pg=PA221 |pages= 221&ndash;233 }}</ref> Palmer and Thornhill responded to these critics in an article in the journal ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=C. |last2=Thornhill |first2=R. |title=A posse of good citizens bring outlaw evolutionists to justice|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep011027.pdf|publisher=Evolutionary Psychology 1 |pages= 10\u201327 |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nSmith et al. (2001) criticized Thornhill and Palmer's hypothesis that a predisposition to rape in certain circumstances is an evolved psychological adaptation. They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the [[Ach\u00e9 people|Ach\u00e9]] in Paraguay). Their model suggested that generally only men with a future reproductive value of 1/10th or less of a typical 25-year-old man would have a net positive cost/benefit fitness ratio from committing rape.  On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men.<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html Why Do We Rape, Kill and Sleep Around?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917175113/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html |date=17 September 2011 }}, Sharon Begley, ''The Daily Beast''</ref><ref name=\"SEM\">{{cite journal |last1= Smith |first1= Eric |last2= Mulde |first2=Monique|last3=Hill|first3=Kim |year= 2001 |title= Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed|journal= [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume= 16 |issue= 3 |pages= 128\u2013135 |url= http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf|accessdate= July 1, 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02077-2 |pmid=11179576}}</ref>\n\nWhile defending the evolutionary psychology theory of rape against its more vehement critics, Vandermassen (2010) provides a critique of some aspects of the view. She characterises the view of Thornhill and Palmer as \"extreme\" (p.&nbsp;736), as they fail to allow for the influence of any non-sexual motivations in the crime of rape. Vandermassen also notes two problems with the data cited by Thornhill and Palmer regarding the psychological trauma caused by the violence associated with rape: firstly, the data are inaccurately and confusingly presented in the book, often obscuring the fact that they do not support Thornhill and Palmer's \"counterintuitive hypothesis\" (p.&nbsp;744) that more physical violence during rape is associated with less psychological pain. Secondly, more recent research has failed to support this hypothesis. A more moderate position, integrating the evolutionary psychology and feminist theories on rape, is presented by Vandermassen, based in part on the work of feminist evolutionary researcher [[Barbara Smuts]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandermassen | first1 = G. | title = Evolution and Rape: A Feminist Darwinian Perspective | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9895-y | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 64 | issue = 9\u201310 | pages = 732\u2013747 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n\nHamilton (2008) has criticized Thornhill and Palmer's definition of rape as the coerced vaginal penetration of women of reproductive age. He has suggested that the exclusion of [[Rape of males|male rape]], rape of women outside the reproductive age range, murderous rape, and non-vaginal forms of rape virtually guaranteed the confirmation of their hypothesis that rape is an evolved reproductive strategy and not a crime of violence. Hamilton has argued that evolutionary psychology fails to explain rape because, by evolutionary psychology's own criteria, an adaptation to rape children or men, or non-vaginal rape, would have been eliminated in the course of evolution because it did not confer reproductive advantage on our ancestors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hamilton |first1= Richard |year= 2008 |title= The Darwinian cage: Evolutionary psychology as moral science |journal= Theory, Culture & Society |volume= 25 |issue= 2 |pages= 105&ndash;125 |doi= 10.1177/0263276407086793 |url= http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=phil_article&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DDarwinian%2Bcage%2Bevolutionary%2Bpsychology%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22Darwinian%20cage%20evolutionary%20psychology%22 |accessdate= March 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologist [[David Buss]] states that clear-cut evidence for or against rape as an adaptation is lacking.

Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider [[rape]] to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, or scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary to develop effective preventive measures.\n\n== ''A Natural History of Rape'' ==\nThe idea that rape evolved under some circumstances as a genetically advantageous behavioral adaptation was popularized by biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Craig T. Palmer]] in their book ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000).\n\n== Animal coercive sex ==\n{{Further|Sexual coercion|Sexual selection|Sexual conflict}}\nIt has been noted that behavior resembling [[rape]] in humans is observed in the animal kingdom, including [[Anatidae|ducks and geese]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, [[bottlenose dolphins]],<ref>Connor, Richard and Vollmer, Nicole (ed.

Demonic males. New York: Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Such behaviors, referred to as 'forced copulations', involve an animal being approached and [[sexual intercourse|sexually penetrated]] as it struggles or attempts to escape. These observations of forced sex among animals are not controversial. What is controversial is the interpretation of these observations and the extension of theories based on them to [[human]]s. \"Thornhill introduces this theory by describing the sexual behavior of scorpionflies. In which the male may gain sex from the female either by presenting a gift of food during courtship or without a nuptial offering, in which case force is necessary to restrain her.\"<ref name=Glenn>Wilson, Glenn. The Science of Sex: Glenn Wilson on Rape. The Great Sex Divide, pp. 128\u2013131. http://www.heretical.com/wilson/rape.html</ref>\n\n== Human rape ==\n\nIt is hypothesized that rape is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to similar behavior in other animals.  \"Human rape appears not as an aberration but as an alternative gene-promotion strategy that is most likely to be adopted by the 'losers' in the competitive, harem-building struggle. If the means of access to legitimate, consenting sex is not available, then a male may be faced with the choice between force or genetic extinction.\"<ref name=Glenn/>\n\nThornhill and Palmer write that \"In short, a man can have many children, with little inconvenience to himself; a woman can have only a few, and with great effort.\" Females therefore tend to be more selective with partners. Rape is seen as one potential strategy for males for achieving reproductive success. They point to several other factors indicating that rape may be a reproductive strategy. It is during the potentially childbearing years that women most often are rape victims. Rapists usually do not use more force than necessary to subdue their victims which is argued to be the case since physically injuring the victims would reduce the chance of reproduction. Furthermore, \"In many cultures rape is treated as a crime against the victim's husband.\"<ref name=Thornhill2000/>\n\nAnthropologist Edward H. Hagen states in his Evolutionary Psychology FAQ from 2002 that he believes there is no clear evidence for the hypothesis that rape is adaptive. He believes the adaptivity of rape is ''possible'', but claims there is not enough evidence to be certain one way or the other. However, he encourages such evidence to be obtained: \"Whether human males possess psychological adaptations for rape will only be answered by careful studies seeking evidence for such cognitive specializations. To not seek such evidence is like failing to search a suspect for a concealed weapon.\" He also describes some conditions in the ancestral environment during which the reproductive gains from rape may have outweighed the costs:\n*\"High status males may have been able to coerce matings with little fear of reprisal.\"\n*\"Low status women (e.g., orphans) may have been particularly vulnerable to being raped because males need not have feared reprisals from the woman's family.\"\n*\"During war, raping enemy women may have had few negative repercussions.\"\n*\"Men who were low status, who were likely to remain low status, and who had few opportunities to invest in kin may have realized reproductive benefits that outweighed the considerable costs (e.g., reprisal by the woman's family).\"<ref>[http://human.projects.anth.ucsb.edu/epfaq/evpsychfaq_full.html#rape Is rape an adaptation?]</ref>\n\nMcKibbin et al. (2008) argue that there may be several different types of rapists or rape strategies. One is rape by disadvantaged men who cannot get sex otherwise. Another is \"specialized rapists\" who are more sexually aroused from rape than from consensual sex. A third type is opportunistic rapists who switch between forced and consensual sex depending on circumstances. A fourth type is [[psychopathic]] rapists. A fifth type is partner rape due to [[sperm competition]] when the male suspects or knows that the female has had sex with another male. There are varying degrees of empirical support for the existence of each of these types. More generally they mention research finding that at least one-third of males \"admit they would rape under specific conditions\" and that other surveys find that many men{{quantify|date=January 2012}} state having coercive sexual fantasies. They, as have others, \"propose that rape is a conditional strategy that may potentially be deployed by any man.\"<ref name=McKibbin/>\n\n=== Women's defenses ===\nWomen may have developed several defenses against and strategies to avoid rape. One is a partner preference for men that are effective bodyguards against other men such as physically and socially dominant men (although there may also be other evolutionary reasons for such a preference). Another is great psychological pain which according to some research is greatest during the childbearing years. Other researchers{{who|date=May 2013}} have argued that the emotional pain may cause the women to focus on the social circumstances that enabled the rape with the aim to prevent future rapes.\n\nOther research has found that during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle women perform fewer behaviors that may increase the risk of an assault.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/article/view/42|title=Risk taking and Women's Menstrual Cycle: Near Ovulation, Women Avoid a Doubtful Man|last=Nicolas|first=Gu\u00e9guen|date=2012|journal=Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science|volume=3|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.5178/lebs.2012.17|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref> Studies have also found that sensitivity for potential coercive behaviors in males as well as handgrip strength (but only in a simulated coercive situation) increase during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.<ref name=McKibbin/>  On the other hand, a 2003 study found that the frequency of [[pregnancy from rape]] is significantly higher than that of pregnancy in non-coercive intercourse, and advanced the hypothesis that male rapists disproportionately target women exhibiting biological indications of fertility.<ref name=Gottschall03>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1014-0 |pmid=26189986 |title=Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates? |year=2003 |last1=Gottschall |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Gottschall |first2=Tiffani A. |journal=Human Nature |volume=14 |pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\n=== Naturalistic fallacy ===\nThornhill and Palmer write that \"Rape is viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage\". They further state that by categorizing a behavior as \"natural\" and \"biological\" they do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. \"Biological\" means \"of or pertaining to life,\" so the word applies to every human feature and behavior. But to infer from that, as many critics assert that Thornhill and Palmer do, that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so-called [[naturalistic fallacy]]. They make a comparison to \"natural disasters as epidemics, floods and tornadoes\". This shows that what can be found in nature is not always good and that measures should be and are taken against natural phenomena. They further argue that a good knowledge of the causes of rape, including evolutionary ones, are necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures.<ref name=Thornhill2000>{{cite web|last1=Thornhill|first1=Randy|last2=Palmer|first2=Craig T.|title=Why Men Rape|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/merlinos/thornhill.html|website=www.csus.edu|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=2000}}</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists McKibbin et al. argue that the claim that evolutionary theories are justifying rape is a fallacy in the same way that it would be a fallacy to accuse scientists doing research on the causes of [[cancer]], that they are justifying cancer. Instead, they say that understanding the causes of rape may help create preventive measures.<ref name=McKibbin>{{Cite journal | last1 = McKibbin | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Shackelford | first2 = T.

(2003) argue that evolutionary psychologists like Thornhill and Palmer use the [[naturalistic fallacy]] inappropriately to forestall legitimate discussion about the ethical implications of their theory. According to Thornhill and Palmer, a naturalistic fallacy is to infer ethical conclusions (e.g., rape is good) from (true or false) statements of fact (e.g., rape is natural). Wilson et al. point out that combining a factual statement with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion is standard ethical reasoning, not a naturalistic fallacy, because the moral judgment is not deduced ''exclusively'' from the factual statement. They further argue that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's factual premise that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. state that Thornhill and Palmer dismiss all ethical objections with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' although \"it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way.\"<ref name=\"wilson2003\">{{cite journal |last1= Wilson |first1= David Sloan |last2= Dietrich |first2= Eric |last3= Clark |first3= Anne B. |year= 2003 |title= On the inappropriate use of the naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary psychology |journal= Biology and Philosophy |volume= 18 |issue= 5 |pages= 669&ndash;681 |doi= 10.1023/A:1026380825208 |url= http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150415084544/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |archivedate= 15 April 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Preventing rape ===\nThornhill and Palmer (2000) suggest a number of possible strategies for preventing rape. One example is explaining to males that they may have predispositions to misread the female invitation of sex. They believe that viewing rape as being due to a desire for domination, and not related to sexual desire, is generally harmful. One example being the claim that the way women dress will not affect the risk of rape. They argue that the much greater societal freedom of dating without supervision, and removal of many barriers between males and females, have created an environment that has also removed many earlier societal controls against rape. It is recommended that \"men and women interact only in public places during the early stages of their relationships\".<ref name=Thornhill2000/>\n\n=== Victim counseling ===\nCounseling of rape victims may also be improved by evolutionary considerations, according to Thornhill and Palmer, and they argue that the view that rape is due to a domination desire, cannot explain to the victim why the rapist seemed to be sexually motivated.\n\nEvolutionary considerations can also help explain the emotional pain felt, as well as the form it takes. They may also help the rape victim understand why the rape victim's partner may see the rape as a form of [[infidelity]]. They also argued that the victim's partner may be helped by such understanding, and be more able to change his or her reaction.<ref name=Thornhill2000/>\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{See also|Criticism of evolutionary psychology}}\nThe 2003 book ''Evolution, Gender, and Rape'', written in response to ''A Natural History of Rape'', compiles the views of twenty-eight scholars in opposition to sociobiological theories of rape. One contributor, [[Michael Kimmel]], criticizes Thornhill and Palmer's argument that female rape victims tend to be sexually attractive young women, rather than children or older women, contrary to what would be expected if rapists selected victims based on inability to resist. Kimmel argues that younger women are the least likely to be married and the most likely to be out on dates with men, and therefore are the most likely to be raped because of opportunity arising from social exposure and marital status.<ref>{{cite book|title= Evolution, Gender, and Rape |isbn= 0-262-20143-7 |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2003 |editor1-last= Travis |editor1-first= Cheryl Brown |last= Kimmel |first= Michael |authorlink1= Michael Kimmel |chapter= An Unnatural History of Rape |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a2TTPKFUXgkC&pg=PA221 |pages= 221&ndash;233 }}</ref> Palmer and Thornhill responded to these critics in an article in the journal ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=C. |last2=Thornhill |first2=R. |title=A posse of good citizens bring outlaw evolutionists to justice|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep011027.pdf|publisher=Evolutionary Psychology 1 |pages= 10\u201327 |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nSmith et al. (2001) criticized Thornhill and Palmer's hypothesis that a predisposition to rape in certain circumstances is an evolved psychological adaptation. They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the [[Ach\u00e9 people|Ach\u00e9]] in Paraguay). Their model suggested that generally only men with a future reproductive value of 1/10th or less of a typical 25-year-old man would have a net positive cost/benefit fitness ratio from committing rape.  On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men.<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html Why Do We Rape, Kill and Sleep Around?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917175113/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html |date=17 September 2011 }}, Sharon Begley, ''The Daily Beast''</ref><ref name=\"SEM\">{{cite journal |last1= Smith |first1= Eric |last2= Mulde |first2=Monique|last3=Hill|first3=Kim |year= 2001 |title= Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed|journal= [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume= 16 |issue= 3 |pages= 128\u2013135 |url= http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf|accessdate= July 1, 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02077-2 |pmid=11179576}}</ref>\n\nWhile defending the evolutionary psychology theory of rape against its more vehement critics, Vandermassen (2010) provides a critique of some aspects of the view. She characterises the view of Thornhill and Palmer as \"extreme\" (p.&nbsp;736), as they fail to allow for the influence of any non-sexual motivations in the crime of rape. Vandermassen also notes two problems with the data cited by Thornhill and Palmer regarding the psychological trauma caused by the violence associated with rape: firstly, the data is inaccurately and confusingly presented in the book, often obscuring the fact that they do not support Thornhill and Palmer's \"counterintuitive hypothesis\" (p.&nbsp;744) that more physical violence during rape is associated with less psychological pain.
