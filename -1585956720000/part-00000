Nicknamed '''Sisi''' (also '''Sissi'''),<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mar\u00eda Pilar Queralt del Hierro |title=Life for this Bavarian princess was no fairy tale |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2019/05-06/empress-elisabeth-of-austria/ |website=History Magazine |publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=15 January 2020 |language=en |date=14 May 2019}}</ref> she enjoyed an informal upbringing before marrying Emperor Franz Joseph I at the age of sixteen. The marriage thrust her into the much more formal [[Habsburg]] court life, for which she was unprepared and which she found uncongenial. Early in the marriage she was at odds with her mother-in-law, [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie]], who took over the rearing of Elisabeth's daughters, one of whom, [[Archduchess Sophie of Austria|Sophie]], died in infancy. The birth of the heir apparent, [[Crown Prince Rudolf]], improved her standing at court, but her health suffered under the strain, and she would often visit Hungary for its more relaxed environment.  She came to develop a deep kinship with Hungary, and helped to bring about the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] in 1867.\n\nThe death of her only son and his mistress [[Mary Vetsera]], in a [[Mayerling incident|murder\u2013suicide at his hunting lodge]] at [[Mayerling]] in 1889 was a blow from which Elisabeth never recovered. She withdrew from court duties and travelled widely, unaccompanied by her family. In 1890, she had a palace built on the Greek [[Island of Corfu]] that she visited often. The palace [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], featuring an elaborate mythological motif, served as a refuge.  She was obsessively concerned with maintaining her youthful figure and beauty, which were already legendary during her life. In 1897, her sister, [[Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria|Duchess Sophie in Bavaria]], died in an accidental fire at the \"[[Bazar de la Charit\u00e9]]\" in Paris. While travelling in Geneva in 1898, she was mortally wounded by an Italian anarchist named [[Luigi Lucheni]]. Elisabeth was the longest serving Empress of Austria at 44 years and remains today the most famous Austrian royal member. \n\n==Biography==\n===Duchess in Bavaria===\n[[File:Elisabeth and Carl Theodor.jpg|thumb|left|Elisabeth at 11 years, her brother [[Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria]], and their dog \"Bummerl\" at [[Possenhofen]] Castle]]\nBorn ''Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie'' on 24 December 1837 in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], she was the fourth child of [[Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria]] and [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria]], the half-sister of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. Maximilian was considered to be rather peculiar; he had a childish love of circuses and traveled the Bavarian countryside to escape his duties. The family's homes were the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich during winter and [[Possenhofen Castle]] in the summer months, far from the protocols of court. \"Sisi\" and her siblings grew up in a very unrestrained and unstructured environment; she often skipped her lessons to go riding about the countryside.<ref>Haslip, Joan, The Lonely Empress: Elisabeth of Austria, Phoenix Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria]], the domineering mother of 23-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], preferring to have [[cousin marriage|a niece as a daughter-in-law]] rather than a stranger, [[arranged marriage|arranged a marriage]] between her son and her sister Ludovika's eldest daughter, [[Helene in Bavaria|Helene]] (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\"). Although the couple had never met, Franz Joseph's obedience was taken for granted by the archduchess, who was once described as \"the only man in the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]]\" for her authoritarian manner.<ref>Nibbs, Ann, The Elusive Empress, Youwriteon, 2008</ref> The Duchess and Helene were invited to journey to the resort of [[Bad Ischl]], [[Upper Austria]] to receive his formal proposal of marriage. Fifteen-year-old Sisi accompanied her mother and sister and they traveled from Munich in several coaches. They arrived late as the Duchess, prone to migraine, had to interrupt the journey; the coach with their gala dresses never did arrive. The family was still in mourning over the death of an aunt so they were [[mourning dress|dressed in black]] and unable to change to more suitable clothing before meeting the young Emperor. While black did not suit eighteen-year-old Helene's dark coloring, it made her younger sister's blonder looks more striking by contrast.<ref>Cone, Polly, Imperial Style: Fashions of the Habsburg Era, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, 1980, p. 129).</ref>\n\nHelene was a pious, quiet young woman, and she and Franz Joseph felt ill at ease in each other's company, but he was instantly infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but defied his mother and informed her that if he could not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in [[Vienna]] at the [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|Augustinerkirche]] on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a [[dower]] equal to US$240,000 today.<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\">Bowers Bahney, Jennifer, Stealing Sisi's Star: How a Master Thief Nearly Got Away with Austria's Most Famous Jewel, McFarland & Co., 2015.</ref>\n\n===Empress of Austria===\n[[File:Amanda Bergstedt 001.jpg|thumb|The young Elisabeth shortly after becoming Austrian Empress (by {{Interlanguage link multi|Amanda Bergstedt|sv}}, 1855)]]\n\nAfter enjoying an informal and unstructured childhood, Elisabeth, who was shy and introverted by nature, and more so among the stifling formality of [[Habsburg]] court life, had difficulty adapting to the Hofburg and its rigid protocols and strict [[etiquette]]. Within a few weeks, Elisabeth started to display health problems: she had fits of coughing and became anxious and frightened whenever she had to descend a narrow steep staircase.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Vandereycken, Walter & Van Deth, Ron, \"The Anorectic Empress: Elisabeth of Austria\", History Today, Vol. 46, April 1996</ref>\n\nShe was surprised to find she was pregnant and gave birth to her first child, a daughter, [[Archduchess Sophie of Austria]] (1855\u20131857), just ten months after her wedding. The elder Archduchess Sophie, who often referred to Elisabeth as a \"silly young mother\",<ref>Cunliffe-Owen, Marguerite, Martyrdom of an Empress, Kessinger Publishing, 2005</ref> not only named the child (after herself) without consulting the mother, but took complete charge of the baby, refusing to allow Elisabeth to [[breastfeed]] or otherwise care for her own child. When a second daughter, [[Archduchess Gisela of Austria]] (1856\u20131932), was born a year later, the Archduchess took the baby away from Elisabeth as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chauviere, Emily, The Marriage of Emperor Francis Joseph and Elisabeth of Austria, 12 August 2011</ref>\n\nThe fact that she had not produced a male heir made Elisabeth increasingly unwanted in the palace. One day she found a pamphlet on her desk with the following words underlined:\n\n{{quote|...The natural destiny of a Queen is to give an heir to the throne. If the Queen is so fortunate as to provide the State with a [[Crown prince|Crown-Prince]] this should be the end of her ambition \u2013 she should by no means meddle with the government of an Empire, the care of which is not a task for women... If the Queen bears no sons, she is merely a foreigner in the State, and a very dangerous foreigner, too. For as she can never hope to be looked on kindly here, and must always expect to be sent back whence she came, so will she always seek to win the King by other than natural means; she will struggle for position and power by intrigue and the sowing of discord, to the mischief of the King, the nation, and the Empire...<ref>Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995, p. 171</ref>}}\n\nHer mother-in-law is generally considered to be the source of the malicious pamphlet.<ref>Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995</ref> The accusation of political meddling referred to Elisabeth's influence on her husband regarding his Italian and Hungarian subjects. When she traveled to Italy with him she persuaded him to show mercy toward political prisoners. In 1857 Elisabeth visited [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] for the first time with her husband and two daughters, and it left a deep and lasting impression upon her, probably because in Hungary she found a welcome respite from the constraints of Austrian court life. It was \"the first time that Elisabeth had met with men of character in Franz Joseph's realm, and she became acquainted with an aristocratic independence that scorned to hide its sentiments behind courtly forms of speech... She felt her innermost soul reach out in sympathy to the proud, steadfast people of this land...\"<ref>Tschuppik, Karl, The Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Constable Publishing, 1930</ref> Unlike the archduchess, who despised the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], Elisabeth felt such an affinity for them that she began to learn Hungarian; the country reciprocated in its adoration of her.\n\nThis same trip proved tragic as both of Elisabeth's children became ill. While Gisela recovered quickly, two-year-old Sophie grew steadily weaker, then died. It is generally assumed today that she died of typhus.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Her death pushed Elisabeth, who was already prone to bouts of melancholy, into periods of heavy [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which would haunt her for the rest of her life. She turned away from her living daughter, began neglecting her, and their relationship never recovered.\n\nIn December 1857 Elisabeth became pregnant for the third time in as many years, and her mother, who had been concerned about her daughter's physical and mental health, hoped that this new pregnancy would help her recover.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Physical regimen===\n[[File:Piloty Adam Portrait Elisabeth in Bayern.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of Elisabeth at [[Possenhofen Castle]], age 15, 1853]]\nAt 172&nbsp;cm (5 feet 8&nbsp;inches), Elisabeth was unusually tall. Even after four pregnancies she maintained her weight at approximately 50&nbsp;kg (110 pounds, 7&nbsp;st 12&nbsp;lbs) for the rest of her life. She achieved this through fasting and exercise, such as gymnastics and riding.\n\nIn deep mourning after her daughter Sophie's death, Elisabeth refused to eat for days; a behavior that would reappear in later periods of melancholy and depression. Whereas she previously had supper with the family, she now began to avoid this; and if she did eat with them, she ate quickly and very little. Whenever her weight threatened to exceed fifty kilos, a \"fasting cure\" or \"hunger cure\" would follow, which involved almost complete fasting. Meat itself often filled her with disgust, so she either had the juice of half-raw beefsteaks squeezed into a thin soup, or else adhered to a diet of milk and eggs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nElisabeth emphasised her extreme slenderness through the practice of [[tightlacing|\"tight-lacing\"]]. During the peak period of 1859\u201360, which coincided with Franz-Joseph's political and military defeats in [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]], her sexual withdrawal from her husband after three pregnancies in rapid succession, and her losing battle with her mother-in-law for dominance in rearing her children, she reduced her waist to 40&nbsp;cm (16&nbsp;inches) in circumference. Corsets of the time were split-[[busk]] types, fastening up the front with hooks and eyes, but Elisabeth had more rigid, solid-front ones made in Paris out of leather, \"like those of Parisian [[courtesans]]\", probably to hold up under the stress of such strenuous lacing, \"a proceeding which sometimes took quite an hour\". The fact that \"she only wore them for a few weeks\" may indicate that even leather proved inadequate for her needs.<ref>Larisch, Marie, My Past, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913, p. 78.</ref> Elisabeth's defiant flaunting of this exaggerated dimension angered her mother-in-law, who expected her to be pregnant continuously.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:Josef Kriehuber Kaiserin Elisabeth mit ihren Kindern 1858.jpg|thumb|Empress Elisabeth with her two children and a portrait of the late Archduchess Sophie Friederike, 1858]]\nAlthough on her return to Vienna in August 1862, a lady-in-waiting reported that \u201cshe eats properly, sleeps well, and does not tight-lace any more\u201d,<ref>Corti, Count Egon, Elizabeth, Empress Of Austria, Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, p.107</ref> her clothing from this time until her death still measured only 18 1/2 \u2013 19 1/2&nbsp;inches around the waist, which prompted the Prince of Hesse to describe her as \u201calmost inhumanly slender\u201d.<ref>Haslip, Joan, The Lonely Empress: Elisabeth of Austria, Phoenix Press, 2000, p. 334</ref> She developed a horror of fat women and transmitted this attitude to her youngest daughter, who was terrified when, as a little girl, she first met Queen Victoria.<ref>Corti, Count Egon, Elizabeth, Empress Of Austria, Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, p.425</ref>\n\nIn her youth Elisabeth followed the fashions of the age, which for many years were [[crinoline|cage-crinolined]] hoop skirts, but when fashion began to change, she was at the forefront of abandoning the hoop skirt for a tighter and leaner silhouette. She disliked both expensive accoutrements and the protocol that dictated constant changes of clothing, preferring simple, monochromatic [[riding habit]]-like attire.<ref>De Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough; Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir, J.B. Lippencott Co., 1899, p. 292</ref> She never wore petticoats or any other \"underlinen\", as they added bulk, and was often literally sewn into her clothes, to bypass waistbands, creases, and wrinkles and to further emphasize the \"[[wasp waist]]\" that became her hallmark.<ref>Larisch, Marie, ''My Past'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913, pp. 65, 78.</ref>\n\nThe empress developed extremely rigorous and disciplined exercise habits. Every castle she lived in was equipped with a [[gym]]nasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her [[bedchamber]] so that she could practise on them each morning, and the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up [[fencing]] in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day for hours on end, becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to [[sciatica]], she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the last years of her life, Elisabeth became even more restless and obsessive, weighing herself up to three times a day. She regularly took steam baths to prevent weight gain; by 1894 she had wasted away to near [[emaciation]], reaching her lowest point of 95.7&nbsp;lbs (43.5&nbsp;kg). There were some aberrations in Elisabeth's diet that appear to be signs of [[binge eating]],<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/> On one occasion in 1878 the Empress astonished her travelling companions when she unexpectedly visited a restaurant incognito, where she drank champagne, ate a broiled chicken and an Italian salad, and finished with a \"considerable quantity of cake\". She may have satisfied her urge to binge in secret on other occasions; in 1881 she purchased an [[English country house]] and had a spiral staircase built from her living room into the kitchen, so that she could reach it in private.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Beauty===\n[[File:Empress Elisabeth of Austria, 1864.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elisabeth depicting her long hair (by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1864), one of two so-called \"intimate\" portraits of the empress; although its existence was kept a secret from the general public, it was the emperor's favourite portrait of her and kept opposite his desk in his private study]]\n\nIn addition to her rigorous exercise regimen, Elisabeth practiced demanding beauty routines. Daily care of her abundant and extremely long hair, which in time turned from the dark blonde of her youth to chestnut brunette, took at least three hours.{{citation needed|date = July 2016}} Her hair was so long and heavy that she often complained that the weight of the elaborate double braids and pins gave her headaches. Her hairdresser, Franziska Feifalik, was originally a stage hairdresser at the Wiener Burgtheater. Responsible for all of Elisabeth's ornate hairstyles, she generally  accompanied her on her wanderings. Feifalik was forbidden to wear rings and required to wear white gloves; after hours of dressing, braiding, and pinning up the Empress' tresses, the hairs that fell out had to be presented in a silver bowl to her reproachful empress for inspection. When her hair was washed with a combination of eggs and cognac once every two weeks, all activities and obligations were cancelled for that day. Before her son's death, she tasked Feifalik with tweezing gray hairs away,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Norton, Frederick, A Nervous Splendor, Penguin, 1980</ref> but at the end of her life her hair was described as \"abundant, though streaked with silver threads.\"<ref name=\"Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough 1899, p.58\">De Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough; Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir, J.B. Lippencott Co., 1899, p.58</ref><ref>Tschuppik, Karl, The Empress Elizabeth of Austria, Constable, 1930, p. 114.</ref>\n\nElisabeth used these captive hours during grooming to learn languages; she spoke fluent English and French, and added [[modern Greek]] to her Hungarian studies. Her Greek tutor, Constantin Christomanos, described the ritual:\n\n<blockquote>Hairdressing takes almost two hours, she said, and while my hair is busy, my mind stays idle. I am afraid that my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser. Hence my headache afterwards. The Empress sat at a table which was moved to the middle of the room and covered with a white cloth. She was shrouded in a white, laced [[peignoir]], her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Unterreiner, Katrin, Sisi \u2013 Mythos und Wahrheit [Legend and Truth], Brandst\u00e4tter, 2005</ref></blockquote>\n\nElisabeth used cosmetics and perfume sparingly, as she wished to showcase her natural beauty. On the other hand, to preserve her beauty, she tested countless beauty products prepared either in the court pharmacy or by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments. She appeared to favor \"Cr\u00e8me C\u00e9leste\" (compounded from white wax, [[spermaceti]], sweet almond oil, and [[rosewater]]), but preferred a wide variety of facial tonics and waters.\n\nHer night and bedtime rituals were just as demanding. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, which she believed was better for retaining and maintaining her upright posture; either raw veal or crushed strawberries lined her nightly leather facial mask.<ref>Fellner, Sabine/Unterreiner, Katrin, Rosenbl\u00fcte und Schneckenschleim [Rosebud and Slug Slime], excerpt, Kurier(Vienna) \u2013 Health, 24 November 2006, page 17.</ref> She was also heavily massaged, and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist; her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive-oil bath in the evening.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter age thirty-two, she decided she did not want the public image of the eternal beauty challenged. Therefore, she did not sit for any more portraits, and would not allow any photographs. The few photos taken without her knowledge show a woman who was \u201cgraceful, but almost too slender\u201d.<ref name=\"Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough 1899, p.58\"/>\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:The Austrian Imperial family in G\u00f6ddollo.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting the Hungarian royal family at [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Palace]] (circa 1870)]]\nFranz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, but she did not reciprocate his feelings fully and felt increasingly stifled by the rigidness of court life. He was an unimaginative and sober man, a political reactionary who was still guided by his mother and her adherence to the strict [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Court]] Ceremonial regarding both his public and domestic life, whereas Elisabeth inhabited a different world altogether. Restless to the point of [[hyperactivity]], naturally [[introverted]], and emotionally distant from her husband, she fled him as well as her duties of life at court, avoiding them both as much as she could. He indulged her wanderings, but constantly and unsuccessfully tried to tempt her into a more domestic life with him.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nElisabeth slept very little and spent hours reading and writing at night, and even took up smoking, a shocking habit for women which made her the further subject of already avid gossip. She had a special interest in history, philosophy, and literature, and developed a profound reverence for the German lyric poet and radical political thinker, [[Heinrich Heine]], whose letters she collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nShe tried to make a name for herself by writing Heine-inspired poetry. Referring to herself as [[Titania]], [[Shakespeare]]'s Fairy Queen, Elisabeth expressed her intimate thoughts and desires in a large number of romantic poems, which served as a type of secret diary.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Most of her poetry relates to her journeys, [[classical Greece|classical Greek]] and romantic themes, and ironic commentary on the [[Habsburg dynasty]]. Her wanderlust is defined by her own work:\n\n<poem>\n     O'er thee, like thine own sea birds \n       I'll circle without rest\n     For me earth holds no corner \n       To build a lasting nest.\n</poem>\n\nElisabeth was an emotionally complex woman, and perhaps due to the melancholy and eccentricity that was considered a given characteristic of her [[Wittelsbach]] lineage (the best-known member of the family being her favorite cousin, the eccentric [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]),<ref>Landi, Karoline Franziska M. Zanardi, The secret of an empress, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1914, p.29</ref> she was interested in the treatment of the mentally ill. In 1871, when the Emperor asked her what she would like as a gift for her [[Saint's Day]], she listed a young tiger and a medallion, but: \"...a fully equipped [[lunatic asylum]] would please me most\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Birth of a son===\n[[File:Achilleion 1 123.JPG|thumb|Empress Elisabeth with Emperor Franz Joseph (before 1898)]]\nOn 21 August 1858, Elisabeth finally gave birth to an heir, [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf]] (1858\u20131889). The 101-gun salute announcing the welcome news to Vienna also signaled an increase in her influence at court. This, combined with her sympathy toward Hungary, made Elisabeth an ideal mediator between the [[Magyars]] and the emperor. Her interest in politics had developed as she matured; she was liberal-minded, and placed herself decisively on the Hungarian side in the increasing conflict of nationalities within the empire.\n\nElisabeth was a personal advocate for Hungarian [[Count Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]], who also was rumored to be her lover.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Whenever difficult negotiations broke off between the Hungarians and the court, they were resumed with her help. During these protracted dealings, Elisabeth suggested to the emperor that Andr\u00e1ssy be made the [[Premier]] of Hungary as part of a compromise, and in a forceful attempt to bring the two men together, strongly admonished her husband:\n\n<blockquote>I have just had an interview with Andr\u00e1ssy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him \u2013 and trust him entirely \u2013 we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I can assure you that you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses \u2013 his understanding and influence in the country \u2013 he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...\n\n...If you say 'No,' if at the last moment you are no longer willing to listen to disinterested counsels. then... you will be relieved forever from my future... and nothing will remain to me but the consciousness that whatever may happen, I shall be able to say honestly to Rudolf one day; \"I did everything in my power. Your misfortunes are not on my conscience.\"<ref name=\"Sisa, Stephan 1995, p. 172\">Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995, p. 172</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen Elisabeth was still blocked from controlling her son's upbringing and education, she openly rebelled. Due to her nervous attacks, fasting cures, severe exercise regime, and frequent fits of coughing, the state of her health had become so alarming that in October 1860 she was reported to suffer not only from \"green-sickness\" ([[anemia]]), but also from physical exhaustion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> A serious lung complaint of \u201cLungenschwindsucht\" ([[tuberculosis]]) was feared by [[Joseph \u0160koda|Dr. Skoda]], a lung specialist, who advised a stay on [[Madeira]].<ref name=\"Weindel, Henri 1909, p.141\">de Weindel, Henri, The real Francis-Joseph: the private life of the emperor of Austria, D. Appleton & Co., 1909, p.141.</ref> During this time the court was rife with malicious rumors that Franz Joseph was having a [[Affair|liaison]] with an actress named Frau Roll,<ref name=\"Weindel, Henri 1909, p.141\"/> leading to speculation today that Elisabeth's symptoms could have been anything from psychosomatic to a result of venereal disease.\n\nElisabeth seized on the excuse and left her husband and children, to spend the winter in seclusion. Six months later, a mere four days after her return to Vienna, she again experienced coughing fits and fever. She ate hardly anything and slept badly, and Dr. Skoda observed a recurrence of her lung disease. A fresh rest cure was advised, this time on [[Corfu]], where she improved almost immediately. If her illnesses were psychosomatic, abating when she was removed from her husband and her duties, her eating habits were causing physical problems as well. In 1862 she had not seen Vienna for a year when her family physician, Dr. Fischer of Munich, examined her and observed serious anemia and signs of \"dropsy\" ([[edema]]). Her feet were sometimes so swollen that she could walk only laboriously, and with the support of others.<ref>Norton, Frederick, A Nervous Splendor, Penguin Press, 1980</ref> On medical advice, she went to [[Bad Kissingen]] for a cure. Elisabeth recovered quickly at the spa, but instead of returning home to assuage the gossip about her absence she spent more time with her own family in Bavaria. In August 1862, after a two-year absence, she returned shortly before her husband's birthday, but immediately suffered from a violent [[migraine]] and vomited four times en route, which might support a theory that some of her complaints were stress-related and psychosomatic.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nRudolf was now four years old, and Franz Joseph hoped for another son to safeguard the succession. Dr. Fischer claimed that the health of the empress would not permit another pregnancy, and she would regularly have to go to Kissingen for a cure. Elisabeth fell into her old pattern of escaping boredom and dull court protocol through frequent walking and riding, using her health as an excuse to avoid both official obligations and sexual intimacy. Preserving her youthful appearance was also an important influence in her avoidance of pregnancies: <blockquote>\"Children are the curse of a woman, for when they come, they drive away Beauty, which is the best gift of the gods\".<ref>Larisch, Marie, My Past, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913, p. 137.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nShe was now more assertive in her defiance of her husband and mother-in-law than before, openly opposing them on the subject of the military education of Rudolf, who, like his mother, was extremely sensitive and not suited to the life at court.<ref>Hamann, Brigitte, The Reluctant Empress</ref>\n\n===Hungarian coronation===\n{{further|Apostolic Majesty}}\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef koron\u00e1z\u00e1sa Bud\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth as Apostolic King and Queen of Hungary]]\n[[File:Erzsebet kiralyne photo Rabending.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Elisabeth as Queen of Hungary (by {{Interlanguage link multi|Emil Rabending|cs}}, 1867)]]\n\nAfter having used every excuse to avoid pregnancy, Elisabeth later decided that she wanted a fourth child. Her decision was at once a deliberate personal choice and a political negotiation: by returning to the marriage, she ensured that Hungary, with which she felt an intense emotional alliance, would gain an equal footing with Austria.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nThe [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] created the dual monarchy of Austria\u2013Hungary. Andr\u00e1ssy was made the first Hungarian prime minister and in return, he saw that Franz Joseph and Elisabeth were officially crowned King and Queen of Hungary in June.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nAs a coronation gift, Hungary presented the royal couple with a country residence in [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151]], {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip}} east of [[Buda-Pest]]. In the next year, Elisabeth lived primarily in G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 and Buda-Pest, leaving her neglected and resentful Austrian subjects to trade rumors that if the infant she was expecting were a son, she would name him Stephen, after the [[Stephen I of Hungary|patron saint and first king of Hungary]]. The issue was avoided when she gave birth to a daughter, [[Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria|Marie Valerie]] (1868\u20131924). Dubbed the \"Hungarian child\", she was born in Buda-Pest ten months after her parents' coronation and baptised there in April.<ref name=\"Sisa, Stephan 1995, p. 172\"/> Determined to bring this last child up by herself, Elisabeth finally had her way. She poured all her repressed maternal feelings on her youngest daughter to the point of nearly smothering her. Sophie's influence over Elisabeth's children and the court faded, and she died in 1872.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\n===Travels===\n[[File:Sissi's desk in Achilleion.jpg|thumb|left|Elisabeth's desk at the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in Corfu]]\nAfter having achieved this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead embarked on a life of travel, and saw little of her children. \u201cIf I arrived at a place and knew that I could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise\u201d. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace on the [[Island of Corfu]] which she named the ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]'', after [[Homer]]'s hero [[Achilles]] in ''[[The Iliad]]''.

She often shopped at the Budapest fashion house, ''Antal Alter'' (now [[Alter \u00e9s Kiss]]), which had become very popular with the fashion-crazed crowd. Newspapers also reported on a series of reputed lovers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Although there is no verifiable evidence of her having an affair, one of her alleged lovers was [[Bay Middleton|George \"Bay\" Middleton]], a dashing [[Anglo-Scot]]. He had been named as the probable lover of Lady Henrietta Blanche Hozier and father of [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|Clementine Ogilvy Hozier]] (the wife of [[Winston Churchill]]). To prevent him from becoming lonely during her long absences, Elisabeth encouraged her husband [[Franz Joseph]]'s close relationship with actress [[Katharina Schratt]].\n<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/>\n\nOn her journeys, Elisabeth sought to avoid all public attention and crowds of people. She was mostly travelling incognito, using pseudonyms like 'Countess of Hohenembs'. Elisabeth also refused to meet European monarchs when she did not feel like it. On her high-speed walking tours, which lasted several hours, she was mostly accompanied by her Greek language tutors or her ladies-in-waiting. Countess Irma Szt\u00e1ray, her last lady-in-waiting, describes the reclusive and highly sensitive empress as a natural, liberal and modest character, as a good listener and keen observer with great intellect.<ref>Haderer, Stefan, Empress Elisabeth's Final Odyssey, European Royal History Journal, Issue 64, Vol. 11.4, Aug 2008</ref>\n\n===Mayerling incident===\n{{main|Mayerling incident}}\n[[File:Mayerling 1889.jpg|thumb|The imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling, in which Crown Prince Rudolf committed suicide in 1889]]\n\nIn 1889 Elisabeth's life was shattered by the death of her only son [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Rudolf]], who was found dead together with his young lover [[Baroness Mary Vetsera]], in what was suspected to be a [[murder-suicide]] on Rudolf's part.

Within a few years, she had lost her father, Max Joseph (in 1888), her only son, Rudolf (1889), her sister [[Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria|Duchess Sophie in Bavaria]] (1887), Helene (1890) and her mother, Ludovika (1892). After Rudolf's death she was thought to have dressed only in black for the rest of her life, although a light blue and cream dress discovered by The Hofburg's Sisi Museum dates to this time.<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/> To compound her losses, Count [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] died a year later, on 18 February 1890. \"My last and only friend is dead,\" she lamented.

Their correspondence increased during their last years, however, and their relationship became a warm friendship. On her imperial steamer, ''Miramar'', Empress Elisabeth travelled through the [[Mediterranean]]. Her favourite places were [[Cape Martin]] on the [[French Riviera]], and also [[Sanremo]] on the Ligurian Riviera, where tourism had started only in the second half of the nineteenth century; [[Lake Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]]; [[Bad Ischl]] in [[Austria]], where the imperial couple would spend the summer; and [[Corfu]]. The Empress also visited countries not usually visited by European royals at the time: [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Malta]], [[Turkey]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Emperor Franz Joseph I]] was hoping that his wife would finally settle down in her palace [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] on Corfu, but Sisi soon lost interest in the fairytale property.

A coach driver helped her to her feet and alerted the Austrian concierge of the Beau-Rivage, a man named Planner, who had been watching the empress's progress toward the ''Gen\u00e8ve''. The two women walked roughly {{convert|100|yards}} to the gangway and boarded, at which point Szt\u00e1ray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth's arm. The empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her. Szt\u00e1ray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat's captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth's identity and since it was very hot on deck, advised the countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. Meanwhile, the boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried Elisabeth to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Szt\u00e1ray opened her dress, cut Elisabeth's corset laces so she could breathe. Elisabeth revived somewhat and Szt\u00e1ray asked her if she was in pain, and she replied, \"No\". She then asked, \"What has happened?\"<ref name=\"test\">Le Comte, Edward S. Dictionary of Last Words.

Alarmed that Elisabeth had not recovered consciousness, she informed the captain of her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, the wife of the hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Szt\u00e1ray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10&nbsp;p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Szt\u00e1ray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands.<ref name=\"Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough 1899, p. 333\">{{cite book|last1=De Burgh|first1= Edward Morgan Alborough| title=Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethempres01burggoog|publisher= J.B.

Because of the sharpness and thinness of the file the wound was very narrow and, due to pressure from Elisabeth's extremely tight corseting, the hemorrhage of blood into the pericardial sac around the heart was slowed to mere drops. Until this sac filled, the beating of her heart was not impeded, which is why Elisabeth had been able to walk from the site of the assault and up the boat's boarding ramp.

There was no blood on the file and the tip was broken off, which occurred when Lucheni threw it away. The file was so dull in appearance it was speculated that it had been deliberately selected because it would be less noticeable than a shiny knife, which would have given Lucheni away as he approached.<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Burgh|first1= Edward Morgan Alborough| title=Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethempres01burggoog|publisher= J.B.

The intensity of shock, mourning, and outrage far exceeded that which occurred at the news of Rudolf's death. An outcry also immediately erupted over the lack of protection for the empress. The Swiss police were well aware of her presence, and telegrams to the appropriate authorities advising them to take all precautions had been dispatched. Police Chief Virieux of the Canton of Vaud had organized Elisabeth's protection, but she had detected his officers outside the hotel the day before the assassination and protested that the surveillance was disagreeable, so Virieux had no choice but to withdraw them.

One set of 27 diamond stars was kept in the Imperial family; they are seen in a photograph that shows the dowry of Rudolf's daughter, [[Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria|Archduchess Elisabeth]], known as \"Erzsi\", on the occasion of her wedding to Prince Otto of Windisch-Graetz in 1902.\n\nAs late as 2020, bouquets tied with the red, white and green ribbon of Hungary are left at her sarcophagus in the [[Capuchin Church, Vienna]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere are several statues of Empress Elisabeth in Slovakia: bronze statue by [[Gyula Don\u00e1th]] from 1903 in Bardejov spa in [[Bardejov]] and busts in [[Polt\u00e1r]] and in [[Pre\u0161ov]].

Composed by [[Fritz Kreisler]], the [[libretto]] was written by Ernst and Hubert Marischka, with orchestrations by [[Robert Russell Bennett]].<ref>\"Orchestrator on His Own\", ''Time'', 12 December 1932.</ref> Although the pet name of the empress was always spelled \"Sisi,\" never \"Sissi,\" this incorrect version of her name persisted in the works about her that followed.\n\nIn 1943 [[Jean Cocteau]] wrote a play about an imagined meeting between Elisabeth and her assassin, ''[[L'Aigle \u00e0 deux t\u00eates]]'' (The Eagle with Two Heads). It was first staged in 1946.\n\nIn 1992, the [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]'' premi\u00e8red at the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna. With libretto by [[Michael Kunze (writer)|Michael Kunze]] and music by [[Sylvester Levay]], this is probably the darkest portrayal of the Empress' life. It portrayed Elisabeth bringing a physical manifestation of death with her to the imperial court, thus destroying the Habsburg dynasty. The leading role in the premiere was played by Dutch musical singer [[Pia Douwes]]. ''Elisabeth'' went on to become the most successful German-language musical of all time and has enjoyed numerous productions around the world.\n\n===Ballet===\nIn his 1978 ballet, ''[[Mayerling (ballet)|Mayerling]]'' [[Kenneth MacMillan]] portrayed Elisabeth in a ''[[pas de deux]]'' with her son Prince Rudolf, the principal character in the ballet.\n\nIn 1993 French ballerina [[Sylvie Guillem]] appeared in a piece entitled, ''Sissi, l'imp\u00e9ratice anarchiste'' (Sissi, Anarchist Empress), choreographed by [[Maurice B\u00e9jart]] to [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss's]] ''[[Kaiser-Walzer|Emperor Waltz]]''.\n\n===Film===\nThe 1921 film ''Kaiserin Elisabeth von \u00d6sterreich'' was one of the first films to focus entirely on Elisabeth. It was co-written by Elisabeth's niece, [[Marie Larisch]] (who played her younger self at the age of 62), and starred Carla Nelsen as the title character. The film later achieved notoriety when a group of [[con-artists]] started selling stills from the murder scene as actual photographs of the crime.\n\n[[Adolf Trotz]] directed the 1931 German film ''[[Elisabeth of Austria (film)|Elisabeth of Austria]]''.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021835/</ref>\n\nIn 1936, [[Columbia Pictures]] released ''[[The King Steps Out]]'', a film version of the operetta \"Sissi\", directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]]. It starred opera diva [[Grace Moore]] and [[Franchot Tone]].\n\n[[Jean Cocteau]] directed the 1948 film version of his play ''[[The Eagle with Two Heads]]''. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1981 film ''[[The Mystery of Oberwald]]'' is another adaptation of Cocteau's play.\n\nIn the German-speaking world, Elisabeth's name is often associated with a trilogy of romantic films about her life directed by [[Ernst Marischka]] which starred a teenage [[Romy Schneider]] and made her famous worldwide:\n* ''[[Sissi (film)|Sissi]]'' (1955)\n* ''[[Sissi \u2013 The Young Empress|Sissi \u2014 die junge Kaiserin]]'' (1956) (''Sissi \u2014 The Young Empress'')\n* ''[[Sissi \u2013 Fateful Years of an Empress|Sissi \u2014 Schicksalsjahre einer Kaiserin]]'' (1957) (''Sissi \u2014 Fateful Years of an Empress'')\n* ''Forever My Love'' is a condensed version, with the three films edited down into one feature and dubbed in English. This version was released in North America in 1962.\n\nIn early dramatizations, Elisabeth appears as peripheral to her husband and son, and so is always shown as a mature character. Schneider's characterization of Elisabeth as a young woman is the first time the \"young\" empress is seen on screen. The trilogy was the first to explicitly depict the romantic myth of Sissi, and ends abruptly with her determination to live a private life. Any further exploration of the topic would have been at odds with the accepted image of the loving wife, devoted mother, and benevolent empress. The three films, newly restored, are shown every [[Christmas]] on [[Austria]]n, German, Dutch, and French [[TV|television]]. In 2007, the films were released as ''The Sissi Collection'' with English [[subtitles]]. Schneider came to loathe the role, claiming, \"Sissi sticks to me like porridge ({{lang|de|Haferbrei}}).\" Later she appeared as a much more realistic and fascinating Elisabeth in [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Ludwig (film)|Ludwig]],'' a 1972 film about Elisabeth's cousin, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. A portrait of Schneider in this film was the only one, taken from her roles, which is displayed in her home.\n\n[[Ava Gardner]] played the empress in the 1968 film ''[[Mayerling (1968 film)|Mayerling]]'', in which [[Omar Sharif]] starred as Crown Prince Rudolf.\n\nA 1991 French-German film called ''{{ill|Sissi la valse des c\u0153urs|fr}}'' ({{aka}} ''Sisi und der Kaiserkuss'') starred French actress Vanessa Wagner as Sisi, [[Nils Tavernier]] as [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] and [[Sonja Kirchberger]] as Helene.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0102936|title=Sissi und der Kaiserku\u00df}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, German comedian and director [[Michael Herbig]] released a [[computer-animated]] [[parody film]] based on Elisabeth under the title ''[[Lissi und der wilde Kaiser]]'' (lit.: \"Lissi and the Wild Emperor\"). It is based on his Sissi [[parody]] sketches featured in his television show ''[[Bullyparade]].''\n\nA recent appearance of Sisi was in the new 2012 biopic about Ludwig II of Bavaria titled ''Ludwig II'', where she was played by [[Hannah Herzsprung]].\n\nIn December 2014, to coincide with the presentation of the Pre-Fall 2015 'Metier d'arts' collection by luxury fashion house [[Chanel]], shown in the [[Schloss Leopoldskron]] palace, creative director [[Karl Lagerfeld]] directed a short film featuring [[Cara Delevingne]] as Empress Elisabeth accompanied by [[Pharrell Williams]]. During a dream sequence, the duo sing a song written by Williams entitled ''CC the World'', playing on the iconic interlocking logo of the fashion house, the initials of its founder [[Coco Chanel]], as well as the Empress's nickname 'Sisi'. Lagerfeld recreated the iconic gown worn by Elisabeth in the portrait by Winterhalter, whilst Pharrell takes on attire similar to Franz Joseph.\n\n===Television===\nElisabeth was portrayed in episode 4 of the 1974 British television series ''[[Fall of Eagles]]''. [[Diane Keen]] played the young Elisabeth and [[Rachel Gurney]] portrayed the empress at the time of Rudolf's death.\n\nThe 1992 BBC adaptation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s Miss Marple mystery ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' centers around the shooting of a fictitious film about Elisabeth. The role of the actress portraying the empress was played by [[Claire Bloom]].\n\nThe season five finale of the Austrian detective television series ''[[Kommissar Rex]]'' (1994) revolves around a deluded woman affected by myth of the empress. The episode, appropriately, is entitled, \"Sisi.\"\n\nA heavily fictionalized version of Elisabeth's younger years is portrayed in a 1997 animated children's series, ''[[Princess Sissi]].''\n\n[[Arielle Dombasle]] portrayed Elisabeth in the 2004 television film ''Sissi, l'imp\u00e9ratrice rebelle'', detailing the last five days of her life.\n\n[[Sandra Ceccarelli]] portrayed an older Elisabeth in the 2006 television dramatization of the [[Mayerling Incident]], ''The Crown Prince''. Her son and his lover were played by [[Max von Thun]] and [[Vittoria Puccini]].\n\nIn December 2009, ''[[Sisi (miniseries)|Sisi]]'', a two-part mini-series, premiered on [[Europe]]an television, produced by a German, [[Austria]]n and [[Italy|Italian]] [[partnership]], starring [[Cristiana Capotondi]] as Elisabeth and [[David Rott]] as [[Emperor Franz Joseph]]. Like the 1997 animated series, this film portrays the romantic mythology surrounding the unhappy [[marriage]] of Elisabeth and Franz Joseph, but the political problems of the empire and the personal troubles of the main characters are dealt with in much better detail than in many other dramas.\n\nIn October 2015 an Italian cartoon series ''Sissi: La Giovane Imperatrice'' (Sissi: The Young Empress) began broadcasting on [[Mondo TV]]. In 2018 after airing two seasons totalling 56 episodes (26 minutes each, with 52 shorter 11-minute episodes slated for its 3D third season) it sold its second season to [[JeemTV]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/mondo-tvs-sissi-makes-royal-appointment-with-jeemtv/ |work=[[Animation Magazine]] |title=Mondo TV\u2019s \u2018Sissi\u2019 Makes Royal Appointment with JeemTV |date=19 June 2018 |first=Mercedes |last=Milligan}}</ref> after already having ported it to [[TV Azteca]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2017/04/10/mondo-tv-shows-gain-exposure-in-latam/ |work=[[Kid Screen]] |title=Mondo TV shows gain exposure in LatAm |first=Elizabeth |last=Foster |date=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\nConstantin [[:el:\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|Christomanos]] (1867\u20131911) who served as Elisabeth's modern Greek language tutor from 1891 to 1893 and escorted her during her stay in Corfu, published his memoirs of her shortly after her death, in his 1899 ''Tagebuchbl\u00e4tter'' (Diary Pages).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chrostomanos |first1=K\u014dstantinos |title=Tagebuchbl\u00e4tter : Erinnerungen des Hauslehrers der Kaiserin Elisabeth |publisher=Czernin |isbn=3707601781 |language=de}}</ref> Although he portrayed Elisabeth in an idealistic favourable manner as a fairytale princess come to life, his book greatly displeased the Imperial Court that declared him ''[[persona non grata]]'' and forced him to resign his University teaching position in Vienna and leave Austria.\n\nThe story of Elisabeth is told in Susan Appleyard's 2016 ebook, ''In a Gilded Cage''.<ref>{{ISBN|9781310170553}}</ref>\n\nElisabeth's youth and early adult life are dramatized in the novel ''Imperial Waltz''<ref>{{ASIN|B002JLIJ88}}</ref> by William S.

Unlike previous portrayals of Elisabeth as a one-dimensional fairy tale princess, Hamann portrayed her as a bitter, unhappy woman full of self-loathing and suffering from various emotional and mental disorders. She was seen to have searched for happiness, but died a broken woman who never found it. Hamann's portrayal explored new facets of the legend of Sisi, as well as contemplating the role of women in high-level politics and dynasties. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nElisabeth and her purported lover, [[George \"Bay\" Middleton]] are included in the 2014 historical fiction novel, ''The Fortune Hunter'' by [[Daisy Goodwin]].<ref>{{ISBN|9781250043894}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nDutch singer [[Petra Berger]]'s album ''[[Petra Berger#Eternal Woman|Eternal Woman]]'' includes \"If I Had a Wish\", a song about Elisabeth.\n\nThe song \"SiSi\" by the Scottish band Washington Irving is inspired by Elisabeth's life.<ref>{{cite web |title=Washington Irving |url=https://glasgowest.com/tag/washington-irving/ |website=glasGOwest |accessdate=23 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nThe [[Empress Elisabeth Bridge]] over the [[Elbe]], opened in 1855, was named after her.<ref name=\"D\u011b\u010d\u00edn\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.decin.estranky.cz/clanky/decinke-pamatky/retezovy-most.html\n| title = \u0158et\u011bzov\u00fd most\n| trans-title=Chain Bridge\n| publisher = Municipality of [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]]\n| date = 27 August 2008\n| language = cs\n| accessdate= 27 June 2015\n}}</ref> \n\nThe Elizabeth Church in [[Lviv, Ukraine]] (now the Greek Catholic [[Church of Sts.

consorts|Queen of Hungary]] by marriage to [[Emperor Franz Joseph I]].\n\nElisabeth was born into the royal [[Bavaria]]n [[House of Wittelsbach]]. Nicknamed '''Sisi''' (also '''Sissi'''),<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mar\u00eda Pilar Queralt del Hierro |title=Life for this Bavarian princess was no fairy tale |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2019/05-06/empress-elisabeth-of-austria/ |website=History Magazine |publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=15 January 2020 |language=en |date=14 May 2019}}</ref> she enjoyed an informal upbringing before marrying Emperor Franz Joseph I at the age of sixteen. The marriage thrust her into the much more formal [[Habsburg]] court life, for which she was unprepared and which she found uncongenial. Early in the marriage she was at odds with her mother-in-law, [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie]], who took over the rearing of Elisabeth's daughters, one of whom, [[Archduchess Sophie of Austria|Sophie]], died in infancy. The birth of the heir apparent, [[Crown Prince Rudolf]], improved her standing at court, but her health suffered under the strain, and she would often visit Hungary for its more relaxed environment.  She came to develop a deep kinship with Hungary, and helped to bring about the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] in 1867.\n\nThe death of her only son and his mistress [[Mary Vetsera]], in a [[Mayerling incident|murder\u2013suicide at his hunting lodge]] at [[Mayerling]] in 1889 was a blow from which Elisabeth never recovered. She withdrew from court duties and travelled widely, unaccompanied by her family. In 1890, she had a palace built on the Greek [[Island of Corfu]] that she visited often. The palace [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], featuring an elaborate mythological motif, served as a refuge.  She was obsessively concerned with maintaining her youthful figure and beauty, which were already legendary during her life. In 1897, her sister, [[Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria|Duchess Sophie in Bavaria]], died in an accidental fire at the \"[[Bazar de la Charit\u00e9]]\" in Paris. While travelling in Geneva in 1898, she was mortally wounded by an Italian anarchist named [[Luigi Lucheni]]. Elisabeth was the longest serving Empress of Austria at 44 years and remains today the most famous Austrian royal member. \n\n==Biography==\n===Duchess in Bavaria===\n[[File:Elisabeth and Carl Theodor.jpg|thumb|left|Elisabeth at 11 years, her brother [[Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria]], and their dog \"Bummerl\" at [[Possenhofen]] Castle]]\nBorn ''Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie'' on 24 December 1837 in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], she was the fourth child of [[Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria]] and [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria]], the half-sister of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. Maximilian was considered to be rather peculiar; he had a childish love of circuses and traveled the Bavarian countryside to escape his duties. The family's homes were the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich during winter and [[Possenhofen Castle]] in the summer months, far from the protocols of court. \"Sisi\" and her siblings grew up in a very unrestrained and unstructured environment; she often skipped her lessons to go riding about the countryside.<ref>Haslip, Joan, The Lonely Empress: Elisabeth of Austria, Phoenix Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn 1853, [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria]], the domineering mother of 23-year-old Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], preferring to have [[cousin marriage|a niece as a daughter-in-law]] rather than a stranger, [[arranged marriage|arranged a marriage]] between her son and her sister Ludovika's eldest daughter, [[Helene in Bavaria|Helene]] (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\"). Although the couple had never met, Franz Joseph's obedience was taken for granted by the archduchess, who was once described as \"the only man in the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]]\" for her authoritarian manner.<ref>Nibbs, Ann, The Elusive Empress, Youwriteon, 2008</ref> The Duchess and Helene were invited to journey to the resort of [[Bad Ischl]], [[Upper Austria]] to receive his formal proposal of marriage. Fifteen-year-old Sisi accompanied her mother and sister and they traveled from Munich in several coaches. They arrived late as the Duchess, prone to migraine, had to interrupt the journey; the coach with their gala dresses never did arrive. The family was still in mourning over the death of an aunt so they were [[mourning dress|dressed in black]] and unable to change to more suitable clothing before meeting the young Emperor. While black did not suit eighteen-year-old Helene's dark coloring, it made her younger sister's blonder looks more striking by contrast.<ref>Cone, Polly, Imperial Style: Fashions of the Habsburg Era, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, 1980, p. 129).</ref>\n\nHelene was a pious, quiet young woman, and she and Franz Joseph felt ill at ease in each other's company, but he was instantly infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but defied his mother and informed her that if he could not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in [[Vienna]] at the [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|Augustinerkirche]] on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a [[dower]] equal to US$240,000 today.<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\">Bowers Bahney, Jennifer, Stealing Sisi's Star: How a Master Thief Nearly Got Away with Austria's Most Famous Jewel, McFarland & Co., 2015.</ref>\n\n===Empress of Austria===\n[[File:Amanda Bergstedt 001.jpg|thumb|The young Elisabeth shortly after becoming Austrian Empress (by {{Interlanguage link multi|Amanda Bergstedt|sv}}, 1855)]]\n\nAfter enjoying an informal and unstructured childhood, Elisabeth, who was shy and introverted by nature, and more so among the stifling formality of [[Habsburg]] court life, had difficulty adapting to the Hofburg and its rigid protocols and strict [[etiquette]]. Within a few weeks, Elisabeth started to display health problems: she had fits of coughing and became anxious and frightened whenever she had to descend a narrow steep staircase.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Vandereycken, Walter & Van Deth, Ron, \"The Anorectic Empress: Elisabeth of Austria\", History Today, Vol. 46, April 1996</ref>\n\nShe was surprised to find she was pregnant and gave birth to her first child, a daughter, [[Archduchess Sophie of Austria]] (1855\u20131857), just ten months after her wedding. The elder Archduchess Sophie, who often referred to Elisabeth as a \"silly young mother\",<ref>Cunliffe-Owen, Marguerite, Martyrdom of an Empress, Kessinger Publishing, 2005</ref> not only named the child (after herself) without consulting the mother, but took complete charge of the baby, refusing to allow Elisabeth to [[breastfeed]] or otherwise care for her own child. When a second daughter, [[Archduchess Gisela of Austria]] (1856\u20131932), was born a year later, the Archduchess took the baby away from Elisabeth as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chauviere, Emily, The Marriage of Emperor Francis Joseph and Elisabeth of Austria, 12 August 2011</ref>\n\nThe fact that she had not produced a male heir made Elisabeth increasingly unwanted in the palace. One day she found a pamphlet on her desk with the following words underlined:\n\n{{quote|...The natural destiny of a Queen is to give an heir to the throne. If the Queen is so fortunate as to provide the State with a [[Crown prince|Crown-Prince]] this should be the end of her ambition \u2013 she should by no means meddle with the government of an Empire, the care of which is not a task for women... If the Queen bears no sons, she is merely a foreigner in the State, and a very dangerous foreigner, too. For as she can never hope to be looked on kindly here, and must always expect to be sent back whence she came, so will she always seek to win the King by other than natural means; she will struggle for position and power by intrigue and the sowing of discord, to the mischief of the King, the nation, and the Empire...<ref>Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995, p. 171</ref>}}\n\nHer mother-in-law is generally considered to be the source of the malicious pamphlet.<ref>Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995</ref> The accusation of political meddling referred to Elisabeth's influence on her husband regarding his Italian and Hungarian subjects. When she traveled to Italy with him she persuaded him to show mercy toward political prisoners. In 1857 Elisabeth visited [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] for the first time with her husband and two daughters, and it left a deep and lasting impression upon her, probably because in Hungary she found a welcome respite from the constraints of Austrian court life. It was \"the first time that Elisabeth had met with men of character in Franz Joseph's realm, and she became acquainted with an aristocratic independence that scorned to hide its sentiments behind courtly forms of speech... She felt her innermost soul reach out in sympathy to the proud, steadfast people of this land...\"<ref>Tschuppik, Karl, The Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Constable Publishing, 1930</ref> Unlike the archduchess, who despised the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], Elisabeth felt such an affinity for them that she began to learn Hungarian; the country reciprocated in its adoration of her.\n\nThis same trip proved tragic as both of Elisabeth's children became ill. While Gisela recovered quickly, two-year-old Sophie grew steadily weaker, then died. It is generally assumed today that she died of typhus.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Her death pushed Elisabeth, who was already prone to bouts of melancholy, into periods of heavy [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which would haunt her for the rest of her life. She turned away from her living daughter, began neglecting her, and their relationship never recovered.\n\nIn December 1857 Elisabeth became pregnant for the third time in as many years, and her mother, who had been concerned about her daughter's physical and mental health, hoped that this new pregnancy would help her recover.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Physical regimen===\n[[File:Piloty Adam Portrait Elisabeth in Bayern.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of Elisabeth at [[Possenhofen Castle]], age 15, 1853]]\nAt 172&nbsp;cm (5 feet 8&nbsp;inches), Elisabeth was unusually tall. Even after four pregnancies she maintained her weight at approximately 50&nbsp;kg (110 pounds, 7&nbsp;st 12&nbsp;lbs) for the rest of her life. She achieved this through fasting and exercise, such as gymnastics and riding.\n\nIn deep mourning after her daughter Sophie's death, Elisabeth refused to eat for days; a behavior that would reappear in later periods of melancholy and depression. Whereas she previously had supper with the family, she now began to avoid this; and if she did eat with them, she ate quickly and very little. Whenever her weight threatened to exceed fifty kilos, a \"fasting cure\" or \"hunger cure\" would follow, which involved almost complete fasting. Meat itself often filled her with disgust, so she either had the juice of half-raw beefsteaks squeezed into a thin soup, or else adhered to a diet of milk and eggs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nElisabeth emphasised her extreme slenderness through the practice of [[tightlacing|\"tight-lacing\"]]. During the peak period of 1859\u201360, which coincided with Franz-Joseph's political and military defeats in [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]], her sexual withdrawal from her husband after three pregnancies in rapid succession, and her losing battle with her mother-in-law for dominance in rearing her children, she reduced her waist to 40&nbsp;cm (16&nbsp;inches) in circumference. Corsets of the time were split-[[busk]] types, fastening up the front with hooks and eyes, but Elisabeth had more rigid, solid-front ones made in Paris out of leather, \"like those of Parisian [[courtesans]]\", probably to hold up under the stress of such strenuous lacing, \"a proceeding which sometimes took quite an hour\". The fact that \"she only wore them for a few weeks\" may indicate that even leather proved inadequate for her needs.<ref>Larisch, Marie, My Past, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913, p. 78.</ref> Elisabeth's defiant flaunting of this exaggerated dimension angered her mother-in-law, who expected her to be pregnant continuously.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:Josef Kriehuber Kaiserin Elisabeth mit ihren Kindern 1858.jpg|thumb|Empress Elisabeth with her two children and a portrait of the late Archduchess Sophie Friederike, 1858]]\nAlthough on her return to Vienna in August 1862, a lady-in-waiting reported that \u201cshe eats properly, sleeps well, and does not tight-lace any more\u201d,<ref>Corti, Count Egon, Elizabeth, Empress Of Austria, Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, p.107</ref> her clothing from this time until her death still measured only 18 1/2 \u2013 19 1/2&nbsp;inches around the waist, which prompted the Prince of Hesse to describe her as \u201calmost inhumanly slender\u201d.<ref>Haslip, Joan, The Lonely Empress: Elisabeth of Austria, Phoenix Press, 2000, p. 334</ref> She developed a horror of fat women and transmitted this attitude to her youngest daughter, who was terrified when, as a little girl, she first met Queen Victoria.<ref>Corti, Count Egon, Elizabeth, Empress Of Austria, Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, p.425</ref>\n\nIn her youth Elisabeth followed the fashions of the age, which for many years were [[crinoline|cage-crinolined]] hoop skirts, but when fashion began to change, she was at the forefront of abandoning the hoop skirt for a tighter and leaner silhouette. She disliked both expensive accoutrements and the protocol that dictated constant changes of clothing, preferring simple, monochromatic [[riding habit]]-like attire.<ref>De Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough; Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir, J.B. Lippencott Co., 1899, p. 292</ref> She never wore petticoats or any other \"underlinen\", as they added bulk, and was often literally sewn into her clothes, to bypass waistbands, creases, and wrinkles and to further emphasize the \"[[wasp waist]]\" that became her hallmark.<ref>Larisch, Marie, ''My Past'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913, pp. 65, 78.</ref>\n\nThe empress developed extremely rigorous and disciplined exercise habits. Every castle she lived in was equipped with a [[gym]]nasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her [[bedchamber]] so that she could practise on them each morning, and the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up [[fencing]] in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day for hours on end, becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to [[sciatica]], she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn the last years of her life, Elisabeth became even more restless and obsessive, weighing herself up to three times a day. She regularly took steam baths to prevent weight gain; by 1894 she had wasted away to near [[emaciation]], reaching her lowest point of 95.7&nbsp;lbs (43.5&nbsp;kg). There were some aberrations in Elisabeth's diet that appear to be signs of [[binge eating]],<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/> On one occasion in 1878 the Empress astonished her travelling companions when she unexpectedly visited a restaurant incognito, where she drank champagne, ate a broiled chicken and an Italian salad, and finished with a \"considerable quantity of cake\". She may have satisfied her urge to binge in secret on other occasions; in 1881 she purchased an [[English country house]] and had a spiral staircase built from her living room into the kitchen, so that she could reach it in private.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Beauty===\n[[File:Empress Elisabeth of Austria, 1864.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elisabeth depicting her long hair (by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1864), one of two so-called \"intimate\" portraits of the empress; although its existence was kept a secret from the general public, it was the emperor's favourite portrait of her and kept opposite his desk in his private study]]\n\nIn addition to her rigorous exercise regimen, Elisabeth practiced demanding beauty routines. Daily care of her abundant and extremely long hair, which in time turned from the dark blonde of her youth to chestnut brunette, took at least three hours.{{citation needed|date = July 2016}} Her hair was so long and heavy that she often complained that the weight of the elaborate double braids and pins gave her headaches. Her hairdresser, Franziska Feifalik, was originally a stage hairdresser at the Wiener Burgtheater. Responsible for all of Elisabeth's ornate hairstyles, she generally  accompanied her on her wanderings. Feifalik was forbidden to wear rings and required to wear white gloves; after hours of dressing, braiding, and pinning up the Empress' tresses, the hairs that fell out had to be presented in a silver bowl to her reproachful empress for inspection. When her hair was washed with a combination of eggs and cognac once every two weeks, all activities and obligations were cancelled for that day. Before her son's death, she tasked Feifalik with tweezing gray hairs away,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Norton, Frederick, A Nervous Splendor, Penguin, 1980</ref> but at the end of her life her hair was described as \"abundant, though streaked with silver threads.\"<ref name=\"Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough 1899, p.58\">De Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough; Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir, J.B. Lippencott Co., 1899, p.58</ref><ref>Tschuppik, Karl, The Empress Elizabeth of Austria, Constable, 1930, p. 114.</ref>\n\nElisabeth used these captive hours during grooming to learn languages; she spoke fluent English and French, and added [[modern Greek]] to her Hungarian studies. Her Greek tutor, Constantin Christomanos, described the ritual:\n\n<blockquote>Hairdressing takes almost two hours, she said, and while my hair is busy, my mind stays idle. I am afraid that my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser. Hence my headache afterwards. The Empress sat at a table which was moved to the middle of the room and covered with a white cloth. She was shrouded in a white, laced [[peignoir]], her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Unterreiner, Katrin, Sisi \u2013 Mythos und Wahrheit [Legend and Truth], Brandst\u00e4tter, 2005</ref></blockquote>\n\nElisabeth used cosmetics and perfume sparingly, as she wished to showcase her natural beauty. On the other hand, to preserve her beauty, she tested countless beauty products prepared either in the court pharmacy or by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments. She appeared to favor \"Cr\u00e8me C\u00e9leste\" (compounded from white wax, [[spermaceti]], sweet almond oil, and [[rosewater]]), but preferred a wide variety of facial tonics and waters.\n\nHer night and bedtime rituals were just as demanding. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, which she believed was better for retaining and maintaining her upright posture; either raw veal or crushed strawberries lined her nightly leather facial mask.<ref>Fellner, Sabine/Unterreiner, Katrin, Rosenbl\u00fcte und Schneckenschleim [Rosebud and Slug Slime], excerpt, Kurier(Vienna) \u2013 Health, 24 November 2006, page 17.</ref> She was also heavily massaged, and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist; her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive-oil bath in the evening.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter age thirty-two, she decided she did not want the public image of the eternal beauty challenged. Therefore, she did not sit for any more portraits, and would not allow any photographs. The few photos taken without her knowledge show a woman who was \u201cgraceful, but almost too slender\u201d.<ref name=\"Burgh, Edward Morgan Alborough 1899, p.58\"/>\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:The Austrian Imperial family in G\u00f6ddollo.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting the Hungarian royal family at [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Palace]] (circa 1870)]]\nFranz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, but she did not reciprocate his feelings fully and felt increasingly stifled by the rigidness of court life. He was an unimaginative and sober man, a political reactionary who was still guided by his mother and her adherence to the strict [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Court]] Ceremonial regarding both his public and domestic life, whereas Elisabeth inhabited a different world altogether. Restless to the point of [[hyperactivity]], naturally [[introverted]], and emotionally distant from her husband, she fled him as well as her duties of life at court, avoiding them both as much as she could. He indulged her wanderings, but constantly and unsuccessfully tried to tempt her into a more domestic life with him.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nElisabeth slept very little and spent hours reading and writing at night, and even took up smoking, a shocking habit for women which made her the further subject of already avid gossip. She had a special interest in history, philosophy, and literature, and developed a profound reverence for the German lyric poet and radical political thinker, [[Heinrich Heine]], whose letters she collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nShe tried to make a name for herself by writing Heine-inspired poetry. Referring to herself as [[Titania]], [[Shakespeare]]'s Fairy Queen, Elisabeth expressed her intimate thoughts and desires in a large number of romantic poems, which served as a type of secret diary.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Most of her poetry relates to her journeys, [[classical Greece|classical Greek]] and romantic themes, and ironic commentary on the [[Habsburg dynasty]]. Her wanderlust is defined by her own work:\n\n<poem>\n     O'er thee, like thine own sea birds \n       I'll circle without rest\n     For me earth holds no corner \n       To build a lasting nest.\n</poem>\n\nElisabeth was an emotionally complex woman, and perhaps due to the melancholy and eccentricity that was considered a given characteristic of her [[Wittelsbach]] lineage (the best-known member of the family being her favorite cousin, the eccentric [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]),<ref>Landi, Karoline Franziska M. Zanardi, The secret of an empress, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1914, p.29</ref> she was interested in the treatment of the mentally ill. In 1871, when the Emperor asked her what she would like as a gift for her [[Saint's Day]], she listed a young tiger and a medallion, but: \"...a fully equipped [[lunatic asylum]] would please me most\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Birth of a son===\n[[File:Achilleion 1 123.JPG|thumb|Empress Elisabeth with Emperor Franz Joseph (before 1898)]]\nOn 21 August 1858, Elisabeth finally gave birth to an heir, [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf]] (1858\u20131889). The 101-gun salute announcing the welcome news to Vienna also signaled an increase in her influence at court. This, combined with her sympathy toward Hungary, made Elisabeth an ideal mediator between the [[Magyars]] and the emperor. Her interest in politics had developed as she matured; she was liberal-minded, and placed herself decisively on the Hungarian side in the increasing conflict of nationalities within the empire.\n\nElisabeth was a personal advocate for Hungarian [[Count Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]], who also was rumored to be her lover.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Whenever difficult negotiations broke off between the Hungarians and the court, they were resumed with her help. During these protracted dealings, Elisabeth suggested to the emperor that Andr\u00e1ssy be made the [[Premier]] of Hungary as part of a compromise, and in a forceful attempt to bring the two men together, strongly admonished her husband:\n\n<blockquote>I have just had an interview with Andr\u00e1ssy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him \u2013 and trust him entirely \u2013 we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I can assure you that you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses \u2013 his understanding and influence in the country \u2013 he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...\n\n...If you say 'No,' if at the last moment you are no longer willing to listen to disinterested counsels. then... you will be relieved forever from my future... and nothing will remain to me but the consciousness that whatever may happen, I shall be able to say honestly to Rudolf one day; \"I did everything in my power. Your misfortunes are not on my conscience.\"<ref name=\"Sisa, Stephan 1995, p. 172\">Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995, p. 172</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen Elisabeth was still blocked from controlling her son's upbringing and education, she openly rebelled. Due to her nervous attacks, fasting cures, severe exercise regime, and frequent fits of coughing, the state of her health had become so alarming that in October 1860 she was reported to suffer not only from \"green-sickness\" ([[anemia]]), but also from physical exhaustion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> A serious lung complaint of \u201cLungenschwindsucht\" ([[tuberculosis]]) was feared by [[Joseph \u0160koda|Dr. Skoda]], a lung specialist, who advised a stay on [[Madeira]].<ref name=\"Weindel, Henri 1909, p.141\">de Weindel, Henri, The real Francis-Joseph: the private life of the emperor of Austria, D. Appleton & Co., 1909, p.141.</ref> During this time the court was rife with malicious rumors that Franz Joseph was having a [[Affair|liaison]] with an actress named Frau Roll,<ref name=\"Weindel, Henri 1909, p.141\"/> leading to speculation today that Elisabeth's symptoms could have been anything from psychosomatic to a result of venereal disease.\n\nElisabeth seized on the excuse and left her husband and children, to spend the winter in seclusion. Six months later, a mere four days after her return to Vienna, she again experienced coughing fits and fever. She ate hardly anything and slept badly, and Dr. Skoda observed a recurrence of her lung disease. A fresh rest cure was advised, this time on [[Corfu]], where she improved almost immediately. If her illnesses were psychosomatic, abating when she was removed from her husband and her duties, her eating habits were causing physical problems as well. In 1862 she had not seen Vienna for a year when her family physician, Dr. Fischer of Munich, examined her and observed serious anemia and signs of \"dropsy\" ([[edema]]). Her feet were sometimes so swollen that she could walk only laboriously, and with the support of others.<ref>Norton, Frederick, A Nervous Splendor, Penguin Press, 1980</ref> On medical advice, she went to [[Bad Kissingen]] for a cure. Elisabeth recovered quickly at the spa, but instead of returning home to assuage the gossip about her absence she spent more time with her own family in Bavaria. In August 1862, after a two-year absence, she returned shortly before her husband's birthday, but immediately suffered from a violent [[migraine]] and vomited four times en route, which might support a theory that some of her complaints were stress-related and psychosomatic.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nRudolf was now four years old, and Franz Joseph hoped for another son to safeguard the succession. Dr. Fischer claimed that the health of the empress would not permit another pregnancy, and she would regularly have to go to Kissingen for a cure. Elisabeth fell into her old pattern of escaping boredom and dull court protocol through frequent walking and riding, using her health as an excuse to avoid both official obligations and sexual intimacy. Preserving her youthful appearance was also an important influence in her avoidance of pregnancies: <blockquote>\"Children are the curse of a woman, for when they come, they drive away Beauty, which is the best gift of the gods\".<ref>Larisch, Marie, My Past, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1913, p. 137.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nShe was now more assertive in her defiance of her husband and mother-in-law than before, openly opposing them on the subject of the military education of Rudolf, who, like his mother, was extremely sensitive and not suited to the life at court.<ref>Hamann, Brigitte, The Reluctant Empress</ref>\n\n===Hungarian coronation===\n{{further|Apostolic Majesty}}\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef koron\u00e1z\u00e1sa Bud\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth as Apostolic King and Queen of Hungary]]\n[[File:Erzsebet kiralyne photo Rabending.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Elisabeth as Queen of Hungary (by {{Interlanguage link multi|Emil Rabending|cs}}, 1867)]]\n\nAfter having used every excuse to avoid pregnancy, Elisabeth later decided that she wanted a fourth child. Her decision was at once a deliberate personal choice and a political negotiation: by returning to the marriage, she ensured that Hungary, with which she felt an intense emotional alliance, would gain an equal footing with Austria.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nThe [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] created the dual monarchy of Austria\u2013Hungary. Andr\u00e1ssy was made the first Hungarian prime minister and in return, he saw that Franz Joseph and Elisabeth were officially crowned King and Queen of Hungary in June.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nAs a coronation gift, Hungary presented the royal couple with a country residence in [[G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151]], {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip}} east of [[Buda-Pest]]. In the next year, Elisabeth lived primarily in G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 and Buda-Pest, leaving her neglected and resentful Austrian subjects to trade rumors that if the infant she was expecting were a son, she would name him Stephen, after the [[Stephen I of Hungary|patron saint and first king of Hungary]]. The issue was avoided when she gave birth to a daughter, [[Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria|Marie Valerie]] (1868\u20131924). Dubbed the \"Hungarian child\", she was born in Buda-Pest ten months after her parents' coronation and baptised there in April.<ref name=\"Sisa, Stephan 1995, p. 172\"/> Determined to bring this last child up by herself, Elisabeth finally had her way. She poured all her repressed maternal feelings on her youngest daughter to the point of nearly smothering her. Sophie's influence over Elisabeth's children and the court faded, and she died in 1872.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\n===Travels===\n[[File:Sissi's desk in Achilleion.jpg|thumb|left|Elisabeth's desk at the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in Corfu]]\nAfter having achieved this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead embarked on a life of travel, and saw little of her children. \u201cIf I arrived at a place and knew that I could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise\u201d. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace on the [[Island of Corfu]] which she named the ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]'', after [[Homer]]'s hero [[Achilles]] in ''[[The Iliad]]''. After her death, the building was purchased by [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]].<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/> Later it was acquired by the nation of [[Greece]] (now [[Greek National Tourism Organization]]) and converted to a museum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to Achilleion Palace |url=http://www.achillion-corfu.gr/default_en.html |website=www.achillion-corfu.gr |publisher=Hellenic Tourism Properties S.A |accessdate=23 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nNewspapers published articles on her passion for [[equestrianism|riding sports]], diet and exercise regimens, and fashion sense. She often shopped at the Budapest fashion house, ''Antal Alter'' (now [[Alter \u00e9s Kiss]]), which had become very popular with the fashion-crazed crowd. Newspapers also reported on a series of reputed lovers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Although there is no verifiable evidence of her having an affair, one of her alleged lovers was [[Bay Middleton|George \"Bay\" Middleton]], a dashing [[Anglo-Scot]]. He had been named as the probable lover of Lady Henrietta Blanche Hozier and father of [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|Clementine Ogilvy Hozier]] (the wife of [[Winston Churchill]]). To prevent him from becoming lonely during her long absences, Elisabeth encouraged her husband [[Franz Joseph]]'s close relationship with actress [[Katharina Schratt]].\n<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/>\n\nOn her journeys, Elisabeth sought to avoid all public attention and crowds of people. She was mostly travelling incognito, using pseudonyms like 'Countess of Hohenembs'. Elisabeth also refused to meet European monarchs when she did not feel like it. On her high-speed walking tours, which lasted several hours, she was mostly accompanied by her Greek language tutors or her ladies-in-waiting. Countess Irma Szt\u00e1ray, her last lady-in-waiting, describes the reclusive and highly sensitive empress as a natural, liberal and modest character, as a good listener and keen observer with great intellect.<ref>Haderer, Stefan, Empress Elisabeth's Final Odyssey, European Royal History Journal, Issue 64, Vol. 11.4, Aug 2008</ref>\n\n===Mayerling incident===\n{{main|Mayerling incident}}\n[[File:Mayerling 1889.jpg|thumb|The imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling, in which Crown Prince Rudolf committed suicide in 1889]]\n\nIn 1889 Elisabeth's life was shattered by the death of her only son [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Rudolf]], who was found dead together with his young lover [[Baroness Mary Vetsera]], in what was suspected to be a [[murder-suicide]] on Rudolf's part. The scandal was known as the Mayerling Incident after the location of Rudolf's hunting lodge in [[Lower Austria]], where they were found.\n\n[[File:L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Erzs\u00e9bet kir\u00e1lyn\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Elizabeth in [[mourning dress]] by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1899]]\nElisabeth never recovered from the tragedy, sinking further into melancholy. Within a few years, she had lost her father, Max Joseph (in 1888), her only son, Rudolf (1889), her sister [[Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria|Duchess Sophie in Bavaria]] (1887), Helene (1890) and her mother, Ludovika (1892). After Rudolf's death she was thought to have dressed only in black for the rest of her life, although a light blue and cream dress discovered by The Hofburg's Sisi Museum dates to this time.<ref name=\"Bowers Bahney 2015\"/> To compound her losses, Count [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] died a year later, on 18 February 1890. \"My last and only friend is dead,\" she lamented. Marie Valerie declared, \"...she clung to him with true and steadfast friendship as she did perhaps, to no other person.\"<ref>Sisa, Stephan, The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture, Vista Court Books, 1995, p. 173</ref> Whether their personal relationship was an intimate one or not, her feelings for him were ones she also felt for his country, and that she knew were wholeheartedly reciprocated by the Magyars.{{citation needed|date = June 2016}}\n\nThe Mayerling scandal increased public interest in Elisabeth, and she continued to be an icon and a sensation in her own right wherever she went. She wore long black dresses that could be buttoned up at the bottom, and carried a white [[parasol]] made of leather in addition to a concealing fan to hide her face from the curious.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TycC_OQQ6QQC&oi=fnd&pg=PP6&dq=empress+elisabeth+of+austria&ots=4w9kMUbggf&sig=z5yHVE4F6LkEn-xOOpPF1O4NRS8#v=onepage&q=fan&f=false|title=The Reluctant Empress: A Biography of Empress Elisabeth of Austria|last=Hamann|first=Brigitte|date=2012-04-05|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=9780571287567|language=en}}</ref>\n\nElisabeth spent little time in Vienna with her husband. Their correspondence increased during their last years, however, and their relationship became a warm friendship. On her imperial steamer, ''Miramar'', Empress Elisabeth travelled through the [[Mediterranean]]. Her favourite places were [[Cape Martin]] on the [[French Riviera]], and also [[Sanremo]] on the Ligurian Riviera, where tourism had started only in the second half of the nineteenth century; [[Lake Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]]; [[Bad Ischl]] in [[Austria]], where the imperial couple would spend the summer; and [[Corfu]]. The Empress also visited countries not usually visited by European royals at the time: [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Malta]], [[Turkey]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Emperor Franz Joseph I]] was hoping that his wife would finally settle down in her palace [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] on Corfu, but Sisi soon lost interest in the fairytale property.

A coach driver helped her to her feet and alerted the Austrian concierge of the Beau-Rivage, a man named Planner, who had been watching the empress's progress toward the ''Gen\u00e8ve''. The two women walked roughly {{convert|100|yards}} to the gangway and boarded, at which point Szt\u00e1ray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth's arm. The empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her. Szt\u00e1ray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat's captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth's identity and since it was very hot on deck, advised the countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. Meanwhile, the boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried Elisabeth to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Szt\u00e1ray opened her dress, cut Elisabeth's corset laces so she could breathe. Elisabeth revived somewhat and Szt\u00e1ray asked her if she was in pain, and she replied, \"No\". She then asked, \"What has happened?\"<ref name=\"test\">Le Comte, Edward S. Dictionary of Last Words.

Fanny Mayer, the wife of the hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Szt\u00e1ray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood.

Because of the sharpness and thinness of the file the wound was very narrow and, due to pressure from Elisabeth's extremely tight corseting, the hemorrhage of blood into the pericardial sac around the heart was slowed to mere drops. Until this sac filled, the beating of her heart was not impeded, which is why Elisabeth had been able to walk from the site of the assault and up the boat's boarding ramp.

He was caught by two cabdrivers and a sailor, then secured by a gendarme. The weapon was found the next day by the concierge during his morning cleaning; he thought it belonged to a laborer who had moved the day before and did not notify the police of his discovery until the following day. There was no blood on the file and the tip was broken off, which occurred when Lucheni threw it away. The file was so dull in appearance it was speculated that it had been deliberately selected because it would be less noticeable than a shiny knife, which would have given Lucheni away as he approached.<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Burgh|first1= Edward Morgan Alborough| title=Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethempres01burggoog|publisher= J.B.

Once it was discovered that an Italian was responsible for Elisabeth's murder, unrest swept Vienna and reprisals were threatened against Italians. The intensity of shock, mourning, and outrage far exceeded that which occurred at the news of Rudolf's death. An outcry also immediately erupted over the lack of protection for the empress. The Swiss police were well aware of her presence, and telegrams to the appropriate authorities advising them to take all precautions had been dispatched. Police Chief Virieux of the Canton of Vaud had organized Elisabeth's protection, but she had detected his officers outside the hotel the day before the assassination and protested that the surveillance was disagreeable, so Virieux had no choice but to withdraw them. It is also possible that if Elisabeth had not dismissed her other attendants that day, an entourage larger than one lady-in-waiting could have discouraged Lucheni, who had been following the Empress for several days, awaiting an opportunity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Burgh|first1= Edward Morgan Alborough| title=Elizabeth, empress of Austria: a memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethempres01burggoog|publisher= J.B.

Composed by [[Fritz Kreisler]], the [[libretto]] was written by Ernst and Hubert Marischka, with orchestrations by [[Robert Russell Bennett]].<ref>\"Orchestrator on His Own\", ''Time'', 12 December 1932.</ref> Although the pet name of the empress was always spelled \"Sisi,\" never \"Sissi,\" this incorrect version of her name persisted in the works about her that followed.\n\nIn 1943 [[Jean Cocteau]] wrote a play about an imagined meeting between Elisabeth and her assassin, ''[[L'Aigle \u00e0 deux t\u00eates]]'' (The Eagle with Two Heads). It was first staged in 1946.\n\nIn 1992, the [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]'' premi\u00e8red at the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna. With libretto by [[Michael Kunze (writer)|Michael Kunze]] and music by [[Sylvester Levay]], this is probably the darkest portrayal of the Empress' life. It portrayed Elisabeth bringing a physical manifestation of death with her to the imperial court, thus destroying the Habsburg dynasty. The leading role in the premiere was played by Dutch musical singer [[Pia Douwes]]. ''Elisabeth'' went on to become the most successful German-language musical of all time and has enjoyed numerous productions around the world.\n\n===Ballet===\nIn his 1978 ballet, ''[[Mayerling (ballet)|Mayerling]]'' [[Kenneth MacMillan]] portrayed Elisabeth in a ''[[pas de deux]]'' with her son Prince Rudolf, the principal character in the ballet.\n\nIn 1993 French ballerina [[Sylvie Guillem]] appeared in a piece entitled, ''Sissi, l'imp\u00e9ratice anarchiste'' (Sissi, Anarchist Empress), choreographed by [[Maurice B\u00e9jart]] to [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss's]] ''[[Kaiser-Walzer|Emperor Waltz]]''.\n\n===Film===\nThe 1921 film ''Kaiserin Elisabeth von \u00d6sterreich'' was one of the first films to focus entirely on Elisabeth. It was co-written by Elisabeth's niece, [[Marie Larisch]] (who played her younger self at the age of 62), and starred Carla Nelsen as the title character. The film later achieved notoriety when a group of [[con-artists]] started selling stills from the murder scene as actual photographs of the crime.\n\n[[Adolf Trotz]] directed the 1931 German film ''[[Elisabeth of Austria (film)|Elisabeth of Austria]]''.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021835/</ref>\n\nIn 1936, [[Columbia Pictures]] released ''[[The King Steps Out]]'', a film version of the operetta \"Sissi\", directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]]. It starred opera diva [[Grace Moore]] and [[Franchot Tone]].\n\n[[Jean Cocteau]] directed the 1948 film version of his play ''[[The Eagle with Two Heads]]''. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1981 film ''[[The Mystery of Oberwald]]'' is another adaptation of Cocteau's play.\n\nIn the German-speaking world, Elisabeth's name is often associated with a trilogy of romantic films about her life directed by [[Ernst Marischka]] which starred a teenage [[Romy Schneider]] and made her famous worldwide:\n* ''[[Sissi (film)|Sissi]]'' (1955)\n* ''[[Sissi \u2013 The Young Empress|Sissi \u2014 die junge Kaiserin]]'' (1956) (''Sissi \u2014 The Young Empress'')\n* ''[[Sissi \u2013 Fateful Years of an Empress|Sissi \u2014 Schicksalsjahre einer Kaiserin]]'' (1957) (''Sissi \u2014 Fateful Years of an Empress'')\n* ''Forever My Love'' is a condensed version, with the three films edited down into one feature and dubbed in English. This version was released in North America in 1962.\n\nIn early dramatizations, Elisabeth appears as peripheral to her husband and son, and so is always shown as a mature character. Schneider's characterization of Elisabeth as a young woman is the first time the \"young\" empress is seen on screen. The trilogy was the first to explicitly depict the romantic myth of Sissi, and ends abruptly with her determination to live a private life. Any further exploration of the topic would have been at odds with the accepted image of the loving wife, devoted mother, and benevolent empress. The three films, newly restored, are shown every [[Christmas]] on [[Austria]]n, German, Dutch, and French [[TV|television]]. In 2007, the films were released as ''The Sissi Collection'' with English [[subtitles]]. Schneider came to loathe the role, claiming, \"Sissi sticks to me like porridge ({{lang|de|Haferbrei}}).\" Later she appeared as a much more realistic and fascinating Elisabeth in [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Ludwig (film)|Ludwig]],'' a 1972 film about Elisabeth's cousin, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. A portrait of Schneider in this film was the only one, taken from her roles, which is displayed in her home.\n\n[[Ava Gardner]] played the empress in the 1968 film ''[[Mayerling (1968 film)|Mayerling]]'', in which [[Omar Sharif]] starred as Crown Prince Rudolf.\n\nA 1991 French-German film called ''{{ill|Sissi la valse des c\u0153urs|fr}}'' ({{aka}} ''Sisi und der Kaiserkuss'') starred French actress Vanessa Wagner as Sisi, [[Nils Tavernier]] as [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] and [[Sonja Kirchberger]] as Helene.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0102936|title=Sissi und der Kaiserku\u00df}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, German comedian and director [[Michael Herbig]] released a [[computer-animated]] [[parody film]] based on Elisabeth under the title ''[[Lissi und der wilde Kaiser]]'' (lit.: \"Lissi and the Wild Emperor\"). It is based on his Sissi [[parody]] sketches featured in his television show ''[[Bullyparade]].''\n\nA recent appearance of Sisi was in the new 2012 biopic about Ludwig II of Bavaria titled ''Ludwig II'', where she was played by [[Hannah Herzsprung]].\n\nIn December 2014, to coincide with the presentation of the Pre-Fall 2015 'Metier d'arts' collection by luxury fashion house [[Chanel]], shown in the [[Schloss Leopoldskron]] palace, creative director [[Karl Lagerfeld]] directed a short film featuring [[Cara Delevingne]] as Empress Elisabeth accompanied by [[Pharrell Williams]]. During a dream sequence, the duo sing a song written by Williams entitled ''CC the World'', playing on the iconic interlocking logo of the fashion house, the initials of its founder [[Coco Chanel]], as well as the Empress's nickname 'Sisi'. Lagerfeld recreated the iconic gown worn by Elisabeth in the portrait by Winterhalter, whilst Pharrell takes on attire similar to Franz Joseph.\n\n===Television===\nElisabeth was portrayed in episode 4 of the 1974 British television series ''[[Fall of Eagles]]''. [[Diane Keen]] played the young Elisabeth and [[Rachel Gurney]] portrayed the empress at the time of Rudolf's death.\n\nThe 1992 BBC adaptation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s Miss Marple mystery ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' centers around the shooting of a fictitious film about Elisabeth. The role of the actress portraying the empress was played by [[Claire Bloom]].\n\nThe season five finale of the Austrian detective television series ''[[Kommissar Rex]]'' (1994) revolves around a deluded woman affected by myth of the empress. The episode, appropriately, is entitled, \"Sisi.\"\n\nA heavily fictionalized version of Elisabeth's younger years is portrayed in a 1997 animated children's series, ''[[Princess Sissi]].''\n\n[[Arielle Dombasle]] portrayed Elisabeth in the 2004 television film ''Sissi, l'imp\u00e9ratrice rebelle'', detailing the last five days of her life.\n\n[[Sandra Ceccarelli]] portrayed an older Elisabeth in the 2006 television dramatization of the [[Mayerling Incident]], ''The Crown Prince''. Her son and his lover were played by [[Max von Thun]] and [[Vittoria Puccini]].\n\nIn December 2009, ''[[Sisi (miniseries)|Sisi]]'', a two-part mini-series, premiered on [[Europe]]an television, produced by a German, [[Austria]]n and [[Italy|Italian]] [[partnership]], starring [[Cristiana Capotondi]] as Elisabeth and [[David Rott]] as [[Emperor Franz Joseph]]. Like the 1997 animated series, this film portrays the romantic mythology surrounding the unhappy [[marriage]] of Elisabeth and Franz Joseph, but the political problems of the empire and the personal troubles of the main characters are dealt with in much better detail than in many other dramas.\n\nIn October 2015 an Italian cartoon series ''Sissi: La Giovane Imperatrice'' (Sissi: The Young Empress) began broadcasting on [[Mondo TV]]. In 2018 after airing two seasons totalling 56 episodes (26 minutes each, with 52 shorter 11-minute episodes slated for its 3D third season) it sold its second season to [[JeemTV]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/mondo-tvs-sissi-makes-royal-appointment-with-jeemtv/ |work=[[Animation Magazine]] |title=Mondo TV\u2019s \u2018Sissi\u2019 Makes Royal Appointment with JeemTV |date=19 June 2018 |first=Mercedes |last=Milligan}}</ref> after already having ported it to [[TV Azteca]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2017/04/10/mondo-tv-shows-gain-exposure-in-latam/ |work=[[Kid Screen]] |title=Mondo TV shows gain exposure in LatAm |first=Elizabeth |last=Foster |date=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\nConstantin [[:el:\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|Christomanos]] (1867\u20131911) who served as Elisabeth's modern Greek language tutor from 1891 to 1893 and escorted her during her stay in Corfu, published his memoirs of her shortly after her death, in his 1899 ''Tagebuchbl\u00e4tter'' (Diary Pages).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chrostomanos |first1=K\u014dstantinos |title=Tagebuchbl\u00e4tter : Erinnerungen des Hauslehrers der Kaiserin Elisabeth |publisher=Czernin |isbn=3707601781 |language=de}}</ref> Although he portrayed Elisabeth in an idealistic favourable manner as a fairytale princess come to life, his book greatly displeased the Imperial Court that declared him ''[[persona non grata]]'' and forced him to resign his University teaching position in Vienna and leave Austria.\n\nThe story of Elisabeth is told in Susan Appleyard's 2016 ebook, ''In a Gilded Cage''.<ref>{{ISBN|9781310170553}}</ref>\n\nElisabeth's youth and early adult life are dramatized in the novel ''Imperial Waltz''<ref>{{ASIN|B002JLIJ88}}</ref> by William S.

discounted ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as [[Batam]], [[Denpasar]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Labuan Bajo]], [[Lombok]], [[Malang]], [[Manado]], [[Lake Toba]] ([[Silangit Airport]]), [[Tanjung Pandan]], and [[Tanjungpinang]], which applies from March to May 2020. Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://industri.kontan.co.id/news/pemerintah-tetapkan-insentif-penerbangan-tiket-pesawat-diskon-hingga-50|title=Pemerintah tetapkan insentif penerbangan, tiket pesawat diskon hingga 50%|last=|first=|date=2020-02-25|website=Kontan.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> Specifically for this ticket price discount, the stimulus fund comes from the IDR 444.39 billion-state budget (APBN) for a discounted value of 30% and 25% of passengers per flight.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20200226091352-532-478192/jurus-jokowi-lawan-virus-corona-dengan-diskon-tiket-pesawat|title=Jurus Jokowi Lawan Virus Corona dengan Diskon Tiket Pesawat|last=Ananda|first=Aria|date=|website=CNNIndonesia.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> Additionally, there are additional ticket discounts paid by Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II in the amount of Rp100 billion and PT Pertamina (Persero) in the amount of Rp260 billion through avtur price discounts, so the total ticket price stimulus is IDR 960 billion so that the ticket price can be discounted by 50%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read273843/lihat-nih-terbang-ke-10-destinasi-wisata-ini-diskonnya-hingga-50|title=Lihat Nih!

Wheelchair-bound middle-schooler Jamie has recently moved in with his aunt\u2019s cheerless family, including\u2014a bit too conveniently\u2014school bully Stevie, Jamie\u2019s new \u201cadoptive brother.\u201d Despite Jamie\u2019s desire to be treated like an ordinary kid (one of the more important themes the authors emphasize) and a dark, lingering unknown (only late in the novel does Jamie reveal the reason for his paralysis and his parents\u2019 absence), humor abounds. Much of it derives from Jamie\u2019s comedic aspirations (he calls himself a \u201csit-down comic\u201d), which are fueled by his friends\u2019 reactions to his one-liners and the encouragement of his warmhearted uncle. Park\u2019s wisecracking cartoons (not all seen by PW) play an integral role in the storytelling, laying bare Jamie\u2019s fears, triumphs, and sense of humor. Not all the jokes land, but plenty do, and the value of having an author with as vast a reach as Patterson put a disabled character in the spotlight shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Ages 8\u201312. Agent: Robert Barnett at Williams & Connolly. (Dec.)\n\n<br />\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Jamie Grimm''' is the [[disability|disabled]] [[protagonist]] of the story. He enters the Planet's Funniest Kid Comic Contest and wins the Long Island competition, then moves on to the state competition and wins. Next he will go to the Regionals in [[Boston]]. He was involved in a serious car accident two years prior that killed his parents and his younger sister, Jenny, and left him [[paralyzed]] from the legs down, and puts him in a [[wheelchair]]. He is later relocated from his home in [[Cornwall, New York|Cornwall]] in Upstate New York to his aunt and uncle's family (who he nicknamed \"the Smileys\" because they never smile, even when Jamie makes a joke) in [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]].\n* '''Suzie Orolvsky''' (AKA '''Cool Girl''') is a girl that Jamie carries her books for. They become good friends and she kisses Jamie at night in the light of the full moon. It is stated that Jamie and Gaynor both have feelings for her. She eventually had to move away to Chicago\n\n* '''Stevie Kosgrov''' is Jamie's adoptive brother and bully. He often makes jokes at his expense saying Jamie is successful because he is disabled.\n* '''Uncle Frankie''' is Jamie's other uncle. He owns Frankie's Good Eats by the Sea Diner and is shown to be very talented with yo-yo tricks.\n* '''Joey Gaynor''' is one of Jamie's best friends. He has long hair, a nose ring, and several tattoos. He is said to be obsessed with girls.\n* '''Jimmy Pierce''' is one of Jamie's best friends. He is said to be nerdy, has glasses, and wears this black hat with a flat top and broad rim. He is a total brainiac and knows everything.\n* '''Gilda Gold''' is Jamie's girlfriend and admirer.\n She is shown to be a [[Boston Red Sox]] fan. \n* '''Shecky''' is a kid from [[Schenectady]] who competes in the New York finals. He tells distasteful and usually insulting jokes, and is overconfident and arrogant. His catch phrase after telling a joke is \"Ba-Boom. Nailed it!\".\n* '''Judy Nazemetz''' is a girl from Manhattan who competes in the New York finals. She is Jamie's friend and apparently has a contract with [[Disney]] to become the next [[Hannah Montana]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- Adding external links to an article or user page for the purpose of promoting a website or a product is not allowed and is considered to be spam.
