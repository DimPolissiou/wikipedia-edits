After two more appearances as a villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joined the ranks of the Avengers in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16 (May 1965).

However, Hawkeye's presence in the Avengers\u2014both the team and the series\u2014was sporadic for nearly a decade starting in early 1973.

At a young age he lost both of his parents in a car accident. After six years in an orphanage, Clint and his brother [[Barney Barton]] ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders.<ref name=\"Hawkeye1\">''Hawkeye'' #1</ref> Clint soon caught the eye of the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], who took the young boy on as his assistant. Along with the help of [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master [[Archery|archer]].<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #2</ref> Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, allowing the Swordsman to escape town.<ref>''Avengers'' #19</ref> Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.<ref name=\"Hawkeye: Blindspot #1\">''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #1</ref>\n\nClint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called \"Hawkeye\", otherwise known as \"The World's Greatest Marksman\". He spent some time as a member of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Tiboldt]]'s Circus,<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #7-8</ref> before joining the [[Coney Island]] Circus. He witnessed [[Iron Man]] in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However, after a misunderstanding on his first outing, Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run, the naive Hawkeye met the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow, Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark. In one of their battles with Iron Man, the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital, the Black Widow disappeared. Hawkeye decided to be a \"straight-shooter\" from then on.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)</ref>\n\n===Avengers===\nHawkeye later rescues [[Edwin Jarvis]] and his mother from a mugger. In gratitude, Jarvis invites Hawkeye to [[Avengers Mansion]] and stages a confrontation to allow the archer to clear his name and gain the trust of the Avengers.<ref>''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #2 (2011)</ref> Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he is serious about becoming a hero. Led by [[Captain America]], Hawkeye joins the team along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] to form the second incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref> Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America's leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to respect him as a mentor and a friend.<ref>''Avengers'' #55</ref> When the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.<ref>''Avengers'' #19 (Aug. 1965)</ref>\n\n[[File:Avengers no. 63 (Marvel Comics - 1969).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Clint Barton as the second [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]] on the cover of ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #63 (April 1969).

The Avengers confronted Egghead's allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master. Tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle;<ref>''Avengers'' #64\u201365 (May\u2013April 1969)</ref> It was later revealed that Barney Barton was actually an undercover FBI agent.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.3 #6</ref> Soon after this encounter, Egghead hires the Swordsman to capture Goliath (thinking him to be Pym instead of Clint). Clint defeats and captures both criminals, finding justice for his brother at last. At the conclusion of the [[Kree-Skrull War]] Clint resumes the identity of Hawkeye with a new costume.

{"title_page": "Witsenhausen's counterexample", "text_new": "'''Witsenhausen's counterexample''', shown in the figure below, is a deceptively simple [[toy problem]] in [[distributed control system|decentralized]] [[stochastic control]]. It was formulated by [[Hans witsenhausen|Hans Witsenhausen]] in 1968.<ref>Witsenhausen, Hans. \"A counterexample in stochastic optimum control.\" ''SIAM J. Control'', Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 131\u2013147 (February 1968)</ref> It is a [[counterexample]] to a natural [[conjecture]] that one can generalize a key result of centralized [[linear\u2013quadratic\u2013Gaussian control]] systems\u2014that in a system with linear dynamics, Gaussian disturbance, and quadratic cost, affine (linear) control laws are optimal\u2014to decentralized systems. Witsenhausen constructed a two-stage linear quadratic Gaussian system where two decisions are made by decision makers with decentralized information and showed that for this system, there exist nonlinear control laws that outperform all linear laws. The problem of finding the optimal control law remains unsolved.<ref name=Ho>Ho, Yu-Chi, \"Review of the Witsenhausen problem\". ''Proceedings of the 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)'', pp. 1611\u20131613, 2008.</ref>\n\n[[File:WitsenhausenCounterexample.jpg]]\n\n==Statement of the counterexample==\n\nThe statement of the counterexample is simple: two controllers attempt to control the system by attempting to bring the state close to zero in exactly two time steps. The first controller observes the initial state <math>x_0.</math> There is a cost on the input <math>u_1</math> of the first controller, and a cost on the state <math>x_2</math> after the input of the second controller. The input <math>u_2</math> of the second controller is free, but it is based on noisy observations <math>y_1=x_1+z</math> of the state <math>x_1</math>  after the first controller's input. The second controller cannot communicate with the first controller and thus cannot observe either the original state <math>x_0</math> or the input <math>u_1</math> of the first controller. Thus the system dynamics are\n\n:<math>x_1=x_0+u_1,</math>\n:<math>x_2=x_1-u_2,</math>\n\nwith the second controller's observation equation\n\n:<math>y_1=x_1+z.</math>\n\nThe objective is to minimize an expected [[loss function|cost function]],\n\n:<math>k^2E[u_1^2]+E[x_2^2],</math>\n\nwhere the expectation is taken over the randomness in the initial state <math>x_0</math> and the observation noise <math>z</math>, which are distributed [[independence (probability theory)|independently]].  The observation noise <math>z</math> is assumed to be distributed in a [[normal distribution|Gaussian]] manner, while the distribution of the initial state value <math>x_0</math> differs depending on the particular version of the problem.\n\nThe problem is to find control functions\n\n:<math>u_1(x_0) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_2(y_1)</math>\n\nthat give at least as good a value of the objective function as do any other pair of control functions. Witsenhausen showed that the optimal functions <math> u_1(x_0)</math> and <math>u_2(y_1)</math> cannot be linear.\n\n==Specific results of Witsenhausen==\n\nWitsenhausen obtained the following results:\n\n*An optimum exists (Theorem 1).\n*The optimal control law of the first controller is such that <math>E(x_1)=0</math> (Lemma 9).\n*The exact solution is given for the case in which both controllers are constrained to be linear (Lemma 11).\n*If <math>x_0</math> has a Gaussian distribution and if at least one of the controllers is constrained to be linear, then it is optimal for both controllers to be linear (Lemma 13).\n*The exact nonlinear control laws are given for the case in which <math>x_0</math> has a [[two point distribution|two-point]] [[symmetric distribution]] (Lemma 15).\n*If <math>x_0</math> has a Gaussian distribution, for some values of the preference parameter <math>k</math> a non-optimal nonlinear solution for the control laws is given which gives a lower value for the expected cost function than does the best linear pair of control laws (Theorem 2).\n\n==The significance of the problem==\nThe counterexample lies at the intersection of [[control theory]] and [[information theory]]. Due to its hardness, the problem of finding the optimal control law has also received attention from the [[theoretical computer science]] community. The importance of the problem was reflected upon in the 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2008, Cancun, Mexico,<ref name=Ho/> where an entire session was dedicated to understanding the counterexample 40 years after it was first formulated.\n\nThe problem is of conceptual significance in decentralized control because it shows that it is important for the controllers to communicate<ref>Mitterrand and Sahai. \"Information and Control: Witsenhausen revisited\". ''Learning, control and hybrid systems'', 1999, Springer.</ref> with each other implicitly in order to minimize the cost. This suggests that control actions in decentralized control may have a dual role: those of control and communication.\n\n==The hardness of the problem==\nThe hardness of the problem is attributed to the fact that information of the second controller depends on the decisions of the first controller.<ref>Ho, Yu-Chi. \"Team decision theory and information structures\". ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', Vol. 68, No.6, June 1980.</ref> Variations considered by [[Tamer Basar]] <ref>Basar, Tamer. \"Variations on the theme of the Witsenhausen counterexample\". ''47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control Cancun'', Mexico, Dec. 9\u201311, 2008.</ref> show that the hardness is also because of the structure of the performance index and the coupling of different decision variables. It has also been shown that problems of the spirit of Witsenhausen's counterexample become simpler if the [[transmission delay]] along an external channel that connects the controllers is smaller than the [[propagation delay]] in the problem. However, this result requires the channels to be perfect and instantaneous,<ref>Rotkowitz, M.; Cogill, R.; Lall, S.; , \"A Simple Condition for the Convexity of Optimal Control over Networks with Delays,\" ''Decision and Control'', 2005 and 2005 ''European Control Conference. CDC-ECC '05. 44th IEEE Conference on'' , pp. 6686\u20136691, 12\u201315 December 2005.</ref> and hence is of limited applicability. In practical situations, the channel is always imperfect, and thus one can not assume that decentralized control problems are simple in presence of external channels.\n\nA justification of the failure of attempts that discretize the problem came from the computer science literature: [[Christos Papadimitriou]] and [[John Tsitsiklis]] showed that the discrete version of the counterexample is  [[NP-complete]].<ref>[[Christos Papadimitriou]] and [[John Tsitsiklis]].  \"Intractable problems in control theory.\" ''24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control'', 1985</ref>\n\n==Attempts at obtaining a solution==\nA number of numerical attempts have been made to solve the counterexample. Focusing on a particular choice of problem parameters <math>(k=0.2,\\;\\sigma_0=5)</math>, researchers have obtained strategies by [[discretization]] and using [[neural networks]].<ref>Baglietto, Parisini, and Zoppoli. \"Numerical solutions to the Witsenhausen counterexample by approximating networks.\" ''IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control''. 2001.</ref> Further research (notably, the work of [[Yu-Chi Ho]],<ref>Lee, Lau, and Ho. \"The Witsenhausen counterexample: A hierarchical search approach for nonconvex optimization problems.\" '' IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control'', 2001</ref> and the work of Li, Marden and [[Jeff S. Shamma|Shamma]] <ref>Li, Marden, and Shamma. \"Learning approaches to the Witsenhausen counterexample from a view of potential games.\" '' IEEE Conference on Decision and Control'', 2009.</ref>) has obtained slightly improved costs for the same parameter choice. The best known numerical results for a variety of parameters, including the one mentioned previously, are obtained by a local search algorithm proposed by S.-H. Tseng and A. Tang in 2017.<ref>Tseng and Tang. \"A Local Search Algorithm for the Witsenhausen's Counterexample.\" '' IEEE Conference on Decision and Control'', 2017.</ref> The first provably approximately optimal strategies appeared in 2010 (Grover, Park, Sahai) <ref>Grover, Sahai, and Park. \"The finite-dimensional Witsenhausen counterexample.\" ''IEEE WiOpt 2010, ConCom workshop'', Seoul, Korea.</ref> where [[information theory]] is used to understand the communication in the counterexample.

It has also been shown that problems of the spirit of Witsenhausen's counterexample become simpler if the [[transmission delay]] along an external channel that connects the controllers is smaller than the [[propagation delay]] in the problem. However, this result requires the channels to be perfect and instantaneous,<ref>Rotkowitz, M.; Cogill, R.; Lall, S.; , \"A Simple Condition for the Convexity of Optimal Control over Networks with Delays,\" ''Decision and Control'', 2005 and 2005 ''European Control Conference. CDC-ECC '05. 44th IEEE Conference on'' , pp. 6686\u20136691, 12\u201315 December 2005.</ref> and hence is of limited applicability. In practical situations, the channel is always imperfect, and thus one can not assume that decentralized control problems are simple in presence of external channels.\n\nA justification of the failure of attempts that discretize the problem came from the computer science literature: [[Christos Papadimitriou]] and [[John Tsitsiklis]] showed that the discrete version of the counterexample is  [[NP-complete]].<ref>[[Christos Papadimitriou]] and [[John Tsitsiklis]].  \"Intractable problems in control theory.\" ''24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control'', 1985</ref>\n\n==Attempts at obtaining a solution==\nA number of numerical attempts have been made to solve the counterexample. Focusing on a particular choice of problem parameters <math>(k=0.2,\\;\\sigma_0=5)</math>, researchers have obtained strategies by [[discretization]] and using [[neural networks]].<ref>Baglietto, Parisini, and Zoppoli. \"Numerical solutions to the Witsenhausen counterexample by approximating networks.\" ''IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control''. 2001.</ref> Further research (notably, the work of [[Yu-Chi Ho]],<ref>Lee, Lau, and Ho. \"The Witsenhausen counterexample: A hierarchical search approach for nonconvex optimization problems.\" '' IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control'', 2001</ref> and the work of Li, Marden and [[Jeff S. Shamma|Shamma]] <ref>Li, Marden, and Shamma. \"Learning approaches to the Witsenhausen counterexample from a view of potential games.\" '' IEEE Conference on Decision and Control'', 2009.</ref>) has obtained slightly improved costs for the same parameter choice. The best known numerical results for a variety of parameters, including the one mentioned previously, are obtained by a local search algorithm proposed by S.-H. Tseng and A. Tang in 2017.<ref>Tseng and Tang. \"A Local Search Algorithm for the Witsenhausen's Counterexample.\" '' IEEE Conference on Decision and Control'', 2017.</ref> The first provably approximately optimal strategies appeared in 2010 (Grover, Park, Sahai) <ref>Grover, Sahai, and Park. \"The finite-dimensional Witsenhausen counterexample.\" ''IEEE WiOpt 2010, ConCom workshop'', Seoul, Korea.</ref> where [[information theory]] is used to understand the communication in the counterexample. The optimal solution of the counterexample is still an open problem.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Witsenhausen's Counterexample}}\n[[Category:Control theory]]\n[[Category:Stochastic control]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Update date format tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witsenhausen%27s_counterexample"}

Poland is the 33rd most populous country in the world (8th in Europe, with 5.4% of the European population). Total population of Poland is almost stagnant ([[population growth]] was 0.08%). In 2018, the average life expectancy was 77.9 years; 74.1 for men and 82 for women. Population distribution is uneven. Ethnically, Poland is a very homogeneous country, with 96.7% of population being Polish.\n\nA number of censuses have assessed this data, including [[Polish 2002 census|a national census in 2002]], and a survey by the [[Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights]] (HFHR), which confirmed there are numerous [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] ethnic groups in Poland. Estimates by INTEREG and ''Eurominority'' present a similar demographic picture of Poland but they provide estimates only for the most numerous of these ethnic groups.\n\nLike many developed nations, [[Poland]] is ageing. In 1950, the median age was 25.8: half of the Polish population was younger, half older. Today it is 38.2. If current trends continue, it may be 51 by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2012/06/14/poland-aging-and-the-economy|title=Poland: Aging and the Economy|website=Worldbank.org|accessdate=31 August 2017}}</ref> As the population is ageing, it also started to decline in the 1990s mainly due to low birth rates and continued emigration overseas which impacted the local economy; however this has started to change, with the Polish government encouraging citizens to return to Poland with increased wage incentives. The number of children born in Polish families ([[Total Fertility Rate|TFR]] of 1.31, down from 2 in 1990) is one of the lowest in [[Central Europe]], but has started to increase in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/poland/total_fertility_rate.html|title=Poland Total fertility rate|website=Indexmundi.com|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://euromonitor.typepad.com/.a/6a01310f54565d970c017ee868aacf970d-pi|title=Russia experiences baby boom|website=Euromonitor.typepad.com|accessdate=31 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106094357/http://euromonitor.typepad.com/.a/6a01310f54565d970c017ee868aacf970d-pi|archive-date=6 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Historical population==\n[[File:Population of Poland.svg|thumbnail|right|Population of Poland 1900-2010]]\n{{details|Historical demography of Poland}}\nFor many centuries, until the end of World War II in 1945, the population of Poland included many significant ethnic minorities.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nThe population of Poland decreased by about six million due to the losses sustained during [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]] and [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|German occupation during World War II]] (1939-1945), and Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous areas in Europe (next to the populations of Slovakia and the Czech Republic) as a result of [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|radically altered borders]] and population expulsions at the end of and after the war. The post-war population movements were accompanied by waves of forced migrations ordered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Polish communist authorities, including the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|transfers of sizable Polish populations]] (1944\u20131946) from [[Kresy|Poland's pre-war eastern territories]] which were incorporated into the Soviet Union, the [[Population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine|expulsion of ethnic Ukrainians to the USSR]] (1944\u20131946), [[Operation Vistula]] (1947), and the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expulsion of Germans]] (1945\u20131950) from [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|former German provinces]] awarded to Poland.\n\n=== Recent trends ===\nAccording to [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)|GUS]], about 38,325,000 people live in Poland, however, the same report states that the number of residents living in the country all the time is approximately 37,200,000; with 1,125,000 people living abroad for 6 to 7 months or more.

Poland is the 33rd most populous country in the world (8th in Europe, with 5.4% of the European population). Total population of Poland is almost stagnant ([[population growth]] was 0.08%). In 2018, the average life expectancy was 77.9 years; 74.1 for men and 82 for women. Population distribution is uneven. Ethnically, Poland is a very homogeneous country, with 96.7% of population being Polish.\n\nA number of censuses have assessed this data, including [[Polish 2002 census|a national census in 2002]], and a survey by the [[Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights]] (HFHR), which confirmed there are numerous [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] ethnic groups in Poland. Estimates by INTEREG and ''Eurominority'' present a similar demographic picture of Poland but they provide estimates only for the most numerous of these ethnic groups.\n\nLike many developed nations, [[Poland]] is ageing. In 1950, the median age was 25.8: half of the Polish population was younger, half older. Today it is 38.2.

The post-war population movements were accompanied by waves of forced migrations ordered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Polish communist authorities, including the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|transfers of sizable Polish populations]] (1944\u20131946) from [[Kresy|Poland's pre-war eastern territories]] which were incorporated into the Soviet Union, the [[Population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine|expulsion of ethnic Ukrainians to the USSR]] (1944\u20131946), [[Operation Vistula]] (1947), and the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|expulsion of Germans]] (1945\u20131950) from [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|former German provinces]] awarded to Poland.\n\n=== Recent trends ===\nAccording to [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)|GUS]], about 38,325,000 people live in Poland, however, the same report states that the number of residents living in the country all the time is approximately 37,200,000; with 1,125,000 people living abroad for 6 to 7 months or more.

{"title_page": "1934 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1934 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 26th. The senior championship was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] who ran away with the title with an 11 win, 2 loss record. Such was their dominance that the league didn't bother playing the 14th round as Richmond had a 6-point lead over their nearest competitor. The Richmond reserve grade team also won the title which was remarkable in that they lost their first two matches before reeling off 12 consecutive wins to claim the title. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition with a 20 to 13 win over [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Richmond's remarkable season also included the Stormont Shield which they won 21 to 5 over [[Newton Rangers]], while their reserve grade team also won the Stallard Cup knockout competition when they beat [[City Rovers|City Rovers Reserves]] 21 to 9. Richmond also recorded two wins over the touring [[West Tigers|Western Suburbs]] side who had won the New South Wales premiership with 18-16 and 10-3 point wins. This was arguably the strongest set of results of any club at the senior level in Auckland Rugby League's history to this point.\n\nThe Roope Rooster competition saw the debut of the [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] and [[Papakura Sea Eagles|Papakura]] senior teams playing in a senior A grade competition with both sides playing on [[Carlaw Park]] # 2 field. Both teams performed meritoriously before Mt Albert went down to Ponsonby 19 to 11, and Papakura lost to Marist 6 points to 3.\n\nThe [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team had a successful season recording wins over [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]] by 35 to 8, [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]] 19 to 12, and South Auckland by 36 to 16. The season also saw the first ever match for an official Auckland M\u0101ori team which played under the name Tamaki. They hosted [[Waikato rugby league team|Lower Waikato]] in a Waitangi Maori Shield match which they won 36 to 13.\n\n==Auckland Rugby League Meetings==\nAt the annual meeting of the junior management committee on March 20 the report they received showed that the number of players and clubs had increased by over 11 percent and 14 percent respectively. The registration fees were an increase on 1932 by \u00a312 4/6. Mr. D. Wilkie was elected chairman, Mr. E. Chapman deputy chairman, while Mr. Mr. W. F. Clarke elected secretary to replace the long serving and retiring Mr. T. R. Davis.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Junior Management/Annual Meeting Business\n| page = 15\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LXV, Issue 68\n| date = 1934-03-21\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340321.2.158\n| accessdate = 2019-12-02}}</ref> Davis was later appointed as a life member of New Zealand Rugby League, as was Arthur Ball (ex-chairman of the Auckland Rugby League Referees\u2019 Association, and C.

The gate takings were over \u00a3400 being available as grants to senior clubs in 1933. The working gate takings were \u00a31,953 12/9 from club matches (an increase of \u00a3158). Ground rents of \u00a3154 7/ were lower but profits of \u00a3196 18/ were recorded from matches with visiting provincial teams. Registered player fees accounted for \u00a399 12/ and this combined with donations and the earlier stated income meant total receipts of \u00a32,636 2/5. Expenditure was \u00a3487 17/6 on ground rents, \u00a3340 17/2 on maintenance and upkeep of the park and grounds, \u00a3175 on staffing grounds and cost to officials, and minor expenses. This meant a balance of \u00a321 4\u20198 to be carried forward. The profit and loss account showed a surplus of assets valued at \u00a36,415 19/7. Reference was also made to the services of George Rhodes who had passed away at the end of the 1933 season after many years as chairman of the league.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Rugby League/Game in Auckland/Last Season Reviewed\n| page = 16\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LXV, Issue 82\n| date = 1934-04-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19340407.2.125\n| accessdate = 2019-12-02}}</ref> At the annual meeting the following officers were elected: patron, Mr. J.

The senior championship was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] who ran away with the title with an 11 win, 2 loss record. Such was their dominance that the league didn't bother playing the 14th round as Richmond had a 6-point lead over their nearest competitor. The Richmond reserve grade team also won the title which was remarkable in that they lost their first two matches before reeling off 12 consecutive wins to claim the title. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition with a 20 to 13 win over [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Richmond's remarkable season also included the Stormont Shield which they won 21 to 5 over [[Newton Rangers]], while their reserve grade team also won the Stallard Cup knockout competition when they beat [[City Rovers|City Rovers Reserves]] 21 to 9. Richmond also recorded two wins over the touring [[West Tigers|Western Suburbs]] side who had won the New South Wales premiership with 18-16 and 10-3 point wins. This was arguably the strongest set of results of any club at the senior level in Auckland Rugby League's history to this point.\n\nThe Roope Rooster competition saw the debut of the [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] and [[Papakura Sea Eagles|Papakura]] senior teams playing in a senior A grade competition with both sides playing on [[Carlaw Park]] # 2 field. Both teams performed meritoriously before Mt Albert went down to Ponsonby 19 to 11, and Papakura lost to Marist 6 points to 3.\n\nThe [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team had a successful season recording wins over [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]] by 35 to 8, [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]] 19 to 12, and South Auckland by 36 to 16. The season also saw the first ever match for an official Auckland M\u0101ori team which played under the name Tamaki. They hosted [[Waikato rugby league team|Lower Waikato]] in a Waitangi Maori Shield match which they won 36 to 13.\n\n==Auckland Rugby League Meetings==\nAt the annual meeting of the junior management committee on March 20 the report they received showed that the number of players and clubs had increased by over 11 percent and 14 percent respectively.
