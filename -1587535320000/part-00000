The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.\n\nSince 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognised only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.\n[[File:Nicos Anastasiades at EPP HQ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Nicos Anastasiades]], President of Cyprus since 2013.]]\nThe House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964.

Lefkara lace is recognised as an [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible cultural heritage (ICH)]] by Unesco, and it is characterised by distinct design patterns, and its intricate, time-consuming production process. A genuine Lefkara lace with full embroidery can take typically hundreds of hours to be made, and that is why it is usually priced quite high. Another local form of art the originated from Lefkara is the production of Cypriot Filigree (locally known as ''Trifourenio''), a type of jewellery that is made with twisted threads of silver. In Lefkara village there is government funded center named Lefkara Handicraft Center the mission of which is to educate and teach the art of making the embroidery and silver jewellery. There's also the Museum of Traditional Embroidery an Silversmithing located in the village which has large collection of local handmade art.\n\nIn modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883\u20131958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.<ref>Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.</ref> Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900\u20131994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924\u20131968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].<ref>Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)</ref> In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day.

In addition on the Greek side of the island there are the private channels ANT1 Cyprus, Plus TV, Mega Channel, Sigma TV, Nimonia TV (NTV) and New Extra. In Northern Cyprus, the local channels are [[Bayrak|BRT]], the Turkish Cypriot equivalent to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, and a number of private channels. The majority of local arts and cultural programming is produced by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and BRT, with local arts documentaries, review programmes and filmed drama series.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Cyprus}}\nThe most worldwide known Cypriot director, to have worked abroad, is [[Michael Cacoyannis]].\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, George Filis produced and directed ''Gregoris Afxentiou'', ''Etsi Prodothike i Kypros'', and ''The Mega Document''. In 1994, Cypriot film production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. In 2000, the annual amount set aside for filmmaking in the national budget was [[Cypriot pound|CYP\u00a3]]500,000 (about \u20ac850,000). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Eurimages]] Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature films on which a Cypriot was an executive producer have received funding from Eurimages. The first was ''I Sphagi tou Kokora'' (1996), followed by ''Hellados'' (unreleased), ''To Tama'' (1999), and ''O Dromos gia tin Ithaki'' (2000).<ref>\"[http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html Film Birth \u2013 History of Cinema \u2013 Cyprus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012748/http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html |date=24 September 2015 }}\".</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Greek filmmaker [[Vassilis Mazomenos]] shot the drama film [[Guilt (movie)|''Guilt'']] in Cyprus. The film was awarded the Best Screenwriting and Best Photography award at the [[London Greek Film Festival]], and was an official selection in the [[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[Cairo International Film Festival]], [[India International Film Festival]], [[Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival]], and [[Fantasporto]]. It was also the opening film in the Panorama of European Cinema in [[Athens]]. In 2010, the film was nominated for the best film from the [[Hellenic Film Academy]].\n\nOnly a small number of foreign films have been made in Cyprus. This includes ''[[Incense for the Damned]]'' (1970), [[The Beloved (1970 film)|''The Beloved'']] (1970), and ''[[Ghost in the Noonday Sun]]'' (1973).<ref>Roger Lewis, ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'' (London: Arrow, 1995) p.130</ref> Parts of the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962) were also filmed in Cyprus.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Cypriot cuisine}}\n[[File:Vin et gastronomie chypriotes.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot ''meze'']]\n\nDuring the medieval period, under the French Lusignan monarchs of Cyprus an elaborate form of courtly cuisine developed, fusing French, Byzantine and Middle Eastern forms. The Lusignan kings were known for importing Syrian cooks to Cyprus, and it has been suggested that one of the key routes for the importation of Middle Eastern recipes into France and other Western European countries, such as blancmange, was via the Lusignan Kingdom of Cyprus. These recipes became known in the West as ''Vyands de Chypre,'' or Foods of Cyprus, and the food historian William Woys Weaver has identified over one hundred of them in English, French, Italian and German recipe books of the Middle Ages. One that became particularly popular across Europe in the medieval and early modern periods was a stew made with chicken or fish called ''malmonia,'' which in English became mawmeny.<ref>William Woys Weaver, 'Poland in the Middle Ages' in Maria Dembinska (ed.) ''Food and Drink in Medieval Poland: Rediscovering a Cuisine of the Past''(Philadelphia: University of University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999) pp.41\u201346</ref>\n\nAnother example of a Cypriot food ingredient entering the Western European canon is the cauliflower, still popular and used in a variety of ways on the island today, which was associated with Cyprus from the early Middle Ages. Writing in the 12th and 13th centuries the Arab botanists [[Ibn al-'Awwam]] and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] claimed the vegetable had its origins were Cyprus,<ref name=AggieHorticulture>{{cite web|title=Cabbage Flowers for Food|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/broccoli.html|website=Aggie Horticulture|publisher=Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas A&M System|accessdate=12 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812232947/http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu//archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/broccoli.html|archive-date=12 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fenwick|first=G.

[[Ambelopoulia]], which is today highly controversial, and illegal, was exported in vast quantities from Cyprus during the Lusignan and Venetian periods, particularly to Italy and France. In 1533 the English traveller to Cyprus, John Locke, claimed to have seen the pickled wild birds packed into large jars, or which 1200 jars were exported from Cyprus annually.<ref>David Bannerman and Mary Bannerman ''Birds of Cyprus'' (London: Oliver and Boyd, 1958) p.384</ref>\n\nAlso familiar to the Lusignans would have been [[Halloumi]] cheese, which some food writers today claim originated in Cyprus during the Byzantine period<ref>{{cite book |author1=Goldstein, Darra |author2=Merkle, Kathrin |author3=Parasecoli, Fabio |author4=Mennell, Stephen |author5=Council of Europe |title=Culinary cultures of Europe: identity, diversity and dialogue |publisher=Council of Europe |year=2005 |page=121 |isbn=978-92-871-5744-7 |quote=Most culinary innovations in the Cypriot cuisine occurred during the Byzantine era&nbsp;...

Cucumber and tomato are used widely in salads. Common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley, pickled cauliflower and beets, asparagus and [[taro]]. Other traditional delicacies are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as ''lountza'' (smoked [[pork loin]]), charcoal-grilled lamb, [[souvlaki]] (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and [[sheftalia]] (minced meat wrapped in [[mesentery]]). ''Pourgouri'' ([[bulgur]], cracked wheat) is the traditional source of carbohydrate other than bread, and is used to make the delicacy [[Kibbeh|koubes]].\n\nFresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients. Frequently used vegetables include courgettes, green peppers, [[okra]], green beans, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and grape leaves, and pulses such as beans, broad beans, peas, black-eyed beans, chick-peas and lentils. The most common fruits and nuts are pears, apples, grapes, oranges, [[mandarin orange|mandarines]], nectarines, [[medlar]], blackberries, cherry, strawberries, figs, watermelon, melon, avocado, lemon, pistachio, almond, chestnut, walnut, and hazelnut.\n\nCyprus is also well known for its desserts, including ''lokum'' (also known as [[Turkish Delight]]) and [[Soutzoukos]].<ref name=giant>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3753928.stm Cyprus villagers make giant sweet]\", ''BBC News'', 18 October 2004</ref> This island has [[Protected geographical indications in the European Union#General regime|protected geographical indication (PGI)]] for its ''lokum'' produced in the village of [[Geroskipou]].<ref name=PGI>{{cite news | title=Turks riled as Cyprus set to win EU trademark on Turkish Delight | date=13 December 2007 | agency=Associated Press | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/13/europe/EU-GEN-Cyprus-Turkish-Delight.php | work =International Herald Tribune | accessdate =14 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202125809/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/13/europe/EU-GEN-Cyprus-Turkish-Delight.php |archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/07/04/agros-rose-preserve-included-protected-geographical-indication-list/|title=Agros rose preserve included in protected geographical indication list|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=4 July 2016|work=Cyprus Mail|access-date=19 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120070241/http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/07/04/agros-rose-preserve-included-protected-geographical-indication-list/|archive-date=20 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center 11.JPG|thumb|[[Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center]] in [[Limassol]]]]\nSport governing bodies include the [[Cyprus Football Association]], [[Cyprus Basketball Federation]], [[Cyprus Volleyball Federation]], [[Cyprus Automobile Association]], Cyprus Badminton Federation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyprusbadminton.com |title=Cyprus Badminton Federation |publisher=Cyprusbadminton.com |accessdate=27 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403054924/http://www.cyprusbadminton.com/ |archivedate=3 April 2009}}</ref> [[Cyprus Cricket Association]], [[Cyprus Rugby Federation]] and the Cyprus Pool Association.\n\nNotable sports teams in the Cyprus leagues include [[APOEL FC]], [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]], [[AC Omonia]], [[AEL Lemesos]], [[Apollon Limassol|Apollon FC]], [[Nea Salamis Famagusta FC]], [[AEK Larnaca FC]], [[AEL Limassol B.C.]], [[Keravnos B.C.]] and [[Apollon Limassol B.C.]].

The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.\n\nSince 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognised only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.\n[[File:Nicos Anastasiades at EPP HQ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Nicos Anastasiades]], President of Cyprus since 2013.]]\nThe House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964.

Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] and Italian [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191\u20131571).\n\nA well known traditional art that dates at least from the 14th century is the [[Lefkara lace|Lefkara Lace]] (also known as \"Lefkaratika\", which originates from the village [[Pano Lefkara|Lefkara]]. Lefkara lace is recognised as an [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible cultural heritage (ICH)]] by Unesco, and it is characterised by distinct design patterns, and its intricate, time-consuming production process. A genuine Lefkara lace with full embroidery can take typically hundreds of hours to be made, and that is why it is usually priced quite high. Another local form of art the originated from Lefkara is the production of Cypriot Filigree (locally known as ''Trifourenio''), a type of jewellery that is made with twisted threads of silver. In Lefkara village there is government funded center named Lefkara Handicraft Center the mission of which is to educate and teach the art of making the embroidery and silver jewellery. There's also the Museum of Traditional Embroidery an Silversmithing located in the village which has large collection of local handmade art.\n\nIn modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883\u20131958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.<ref>Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.</ref> Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900\u20131994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924\u20131968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].<ref>Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)</ref> In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day.

The Lusignan kings were known for importing Syrian cooks to Cyprus, and it has been suggested that one of the key routes for the importation of Middle Eastern recipes into France and other Western European countries, such as blancmange, was via the Lusignan Kingdom of Cyprus. These recipes became known in the West as ''Vyands de Chypre,'' or Foods of Cyprus, and the food historian William Woys Weaver has identified over one hundred of them in English, French, Italian and German recipe books of the Middle Ages. One that became particularly popular across Europe in the medieval and early modern periods was a stew made with chicken or fish called ''malmonia,'' which in English became mawmeny.<ref>William Woys Weaver, 'Poland in the Middle Ages' in Maria Dembinska (ed.)

[[Ambelopoulia]], which is today highly controversial, and illegal, was exported in vast quantities from Cyprus during the Lusignan and Venetian periods, particularly to Italy and France.

With over 200,000 living initiates, Tri Delta is one of the largest [[National Panhellenic Conference]] sororities.\n\n==History==\n{{Peacock|date=June 2018}}\nDelta Delta Delta was founded by Sarah Ida Shaw, Eleanor Dorcas Pond, Florence Isabelle Stewart, and Isabel Morgan Breed at [[Boston University]]. Three women's fraternities were already represented at Boston University in 1888 ([[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Alpha Phi]]). Shaw enlisted the help of Eleanor Dorcas Pond and told her, \"Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.\"\n\nThe two young women began the work of creating a new national fraternity. Later Sarah wrote \"...The two enthusiastic friends were unaware of the fact that there was something stupendous about the task they had set hands, heads and hearts to accomplish. They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.\"\n\nShaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution and designed the emblems. Choosing the name was a mutual decision. Pond suggested a triple letter while Shaw chose the actual letter and developed Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Lore]], [[Hindu|Hindu mysticism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]] and [[Astronomy]], reflecting Shaw's wide and various interests.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Tri Delta as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|last=Domhoff|first=G.

The [[dolphin]] is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the [[ancient Greeks]]. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold and [[cerulean blue]], while the [[pearl]] is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the [[pansy]] as its official flower and the [[pine tree]] as its official tree.\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver [[trident]] on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a [[torse]] with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto ''Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas'' (\"Let us steadfastly love one another\") is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.\n\n===Official insignia===\nTri Delta's official badge is the Stars and Crescent, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her chapter Initiation number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is \"lent\" to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the expectation that the badge will be returned upon the member's death or resignation.\n\nPrior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an \"inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.\" A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.\n\nTri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member's initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of [[Butler University]].\n\n==Programs==\n===Philanthropy===\nMany chapters observe \"Sleighbell Day\" on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children's cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.\n\nIn 1999, Tri Delta partnered with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]]) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP,  and football tailgates on their campuses each year. Since 1999, Tri Delta has raised more than $30 million for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\">{{cite web|date=January 11, 2012 |title=St. Jude Fundraising Update |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/news/01_11_2012 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> In 2002, Tri Deltas committed to raising $1 million to build a Teen Room at the St. Jude Hospital in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], fulfilling the commitment in 2005.

Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude's only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/while-here/housing/tri-delta-place.html|title=Tri Delta Place|website=www.stjude.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\" />\n\nIn addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children's Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at University of Toronto|url = http://utoronto.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = utoronto.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>, the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and local children's cancer charities in various states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at The University of Ottawa|url = http://ottawa.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = ottawa.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity [[baseball]] tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play ([[kickball]] tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named \"Delta House of Pancakes,\" \"Delta Diner,\" or \"TriHOP\", and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in \"Sincerely Yours\", an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|url = http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?company_id=2050&pg=national_company|website = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===''The Trident''===\n''The Trident'' is Tri Delta's official publication, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women's health, editorials, and upcoming events.\n\n==Membership==\n===Leadership===\nActive members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra \"The Office Selects the Officer\", and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.\n\nEach collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice-President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair-positions are tailored to each chapter's specific needs.\n\n===Chapter Development Consultants===\nSince 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.\n\n===Alumnae involvement===\nAfter graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumna chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation's scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumna advisory team. Members volunteering on an international level include members of the National Housing Corporation,<ref>{{cite web|title = National House Corporation|url = http://www.tridelta.org/about/executive-office/nhc/|website = Tri Delta|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}</ref> who manage fraternity properties, and members of the Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Foundation -

With over 200,000 living initiates, Tri Delta is one of the largest [[National Panhellenic Conference]] sororities.\n\n==History==\n{{Peacock|date=June 2018}}\nDelta Delta Delta was founded by Sarah Ida Shaw, Eleanor Dorcas Pond, Florence Isabelle Stewart, and Isabel Morgan Breed at [[Boston University]]. Three women's fraternities were already represented at Boston University in 1888 ([[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Alpha Phi]]). Shaw enlisted the help of Eleanor Dorcas Pond and told her, \"Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.\"\n\nThe two young women began the work of creating a new national fraternity. Later Sarah wrote \"...The two enthusiastic friends were unaware of the fact that there was something stupendous about the task they had set hands, heads and hearts to accomplish. They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.\"\n\nShaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution and designed the emblems. Choosing the name was a mutual decision. Pond suggested a triple letter while Shaw chose the actual letter and developed Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Lore]], [[Hindu|Hindu mysticism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]] and [[Astronomy]], reflecting Shaw's wide and various interests.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Tri Delta as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|last=Domhoff|first=G.

The [[dolphin]] is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the [[ancient Greeks]]. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold and [[cerulean blue]], while the [[pearl]] is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the [[pansy]] as its official flower and the [[pine tree]] as its official tree.\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver [[trident]] on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a [[torse]] with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto ''Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas'' (\"Let us steadfastly love one another\") is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.\n\n===Official insignia===\nTri Delta's official badge is the Stars and Crescent, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her chapter Initiation number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is \"lent\" to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the expectation that the badge will be returned upon the member's death or resignation.\n\nPrior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an \"inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.\" A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.\n\nTri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member's initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of [[Butler University]].\n\n==Programs==\n===Philanthropy===\nMany chapters observe \"Sleighbell Day\" on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children's cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.\n\nIn 1999, Tri Delta partnered with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]]) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP,  and football tailgates on their campuses each year. Since 1999, Tri Delta has raised more than $30 million for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\">{{cite web|date=January 11, 2012 |title=St. Jude Fundraising Update |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/news/01_11_2012 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> In 2002, Tri Deltas committed to raising $1 million to build a Teen Room at the St. Jude Hospital in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], fulfilling the commitment in 2005. In July 2006, Tri Delta committed to raise $10 million in 10 years to build a new patient treatment floor focusing on brain tumor research at St. Jude, instead raising $10.4 million in 4 years. In 2010, a new philanthropic goal was announced to raise $15 million in 5 years.<ref name=\"15in5\">{{cite web|title=$15 Million in 5 years |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/aboutus/st_jude_15in5 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-28}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> On February 1, 2014, it was announced that Tri Delta surpassed the $15 million goal in just 3.5 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tridelta.org/news/$15millionraisedforstjudein35years |title=$15 Million Raised for St. Jude in 3.5 Years |publisher=Tri Delta |accessdate=2014-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314145243/http://www.tridelta.org/news/%2415millionraisedforstjudein35years |archivedate=March 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On July 4, 2014, Tri Delta announced a new philanthropic goal to raise $60 million over 10 years, the largest single commitment by a partner of St. Jude in the history of the hospital.  Only three-and-a-half years into the 10 year commitment to raise $60 million, Tri Delta hit the halfway point and announced $30 million raised for St. Jude in January 2018. Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude's only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/while-here/housing/tri-delta-place.html|title=Tri Delta Place|website=www.stjude.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\" />\n\nIn addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children's Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at University of Toronto|url = http://utoronto.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = utoronto.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>, the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and local children's cancer charities in various states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at The University of Ottawa|url = http://ottawa.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = ottawa.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity [[baseball]] tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play ([[kickball]] tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named \"Delta House of Pancakes,\" \"Delta Diner,\" or \"TriHOP\", and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in \"Sincerely Yours\", an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|url = http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?company_id=2050&pg=national_company|website = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===''The Trident''===\n''The Trident'' is Tri Delta's official publication, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women's health, editorials, and upcoming events.\n\n==Membership==\n===Leadership===\nActive members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra \"The Office Selects the Officer\", and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.\n\nEach collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice-President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair-positions are tailored to each chapter's specific needs.\n\n===Chapter Development Consultants===\nSince 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.\n\n===Alumnae involvement===\nAfter graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumna chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation's scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumna advisory team. Members volunteering on an international level include members of the National Housing Corporation,<ref>{{cite web|title = National House Corporation|url = http://www.tridelta.org/about/executive-office/nhc/|website = Tri Delta|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}</ref> who manage fraternity properties, and members of the Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Foundation -

Passing the GED test gives those who do not complete high school, or who do not meet requirements for [[high school diploma]], the opportunity to earn their high school equivalency credential, also called a high school equivalency development or general equivalency diploma.

M. (1989). Overview of recent extinctions. Conservation for the Twenty-first Century. D. Western and M. Pearl, New York, Oxford University Press: 37-41.</ref>\n\n===Overkill===\nOverkill happens whenever hunting occurs at rates greater than the reproductive capacity of the population is being exploited. The effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow growing populations such as many larger [[species]] of fish. Initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted, an increased availability of resources (food, etc.) is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as [[Density dependence|density dependent]] inhibition is lowered. Hunting, [[fishing]] and so on, has lowered the competition between members of a population. However, if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young, the population will begin to [[resource depletion|decrease in numbers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/critical-species/|title=Critical Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519025342/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/critical-species/|archivedate=19 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPopulations that are confined to islands, whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an \"island\" for the species concerned, have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population rise of deaths declines following [[Unsustainable fishing methods|unsustainable hunting]].\n\n===Habitat destruction and fragmentation===\n{{main|Habitat destruction|Habitat fragmentation}}\n[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Deforestation]] and increased road-building in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]\nThe [[habitat]] of any given species is considered its preferred area or [[Territory (animal)|territory]]. Many processes associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species. In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape. Agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented, or relictual, habitat. Farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.\n\nExamples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals, changes to natural fire regimes, forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion.\n\n===Impact of introduced species===\n{{main|Introduced species}}\n{{see also|Invasive species}}\n[[Mice]], [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[dandelion]]s and [[poison ivy]] are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world. Frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates. The reasons for this have not always been clear and [[Charles Darwin]] felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved. The reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully. Occasionally, however, some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly, having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they have become part.\n\n===Chains of extinction===\nThis final group is one of secondary effects. All wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them. Large [[herbivorous]] animals such as the [[hippopotamus]] have populations of [[insectivorous]] birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo. Should the hippo die out, so too will these groups of [[birds]], leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected. Also referred to as a [[domino effect]], this series of [[chain reaction]]s is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any [[Biocoenosis|ecological community]].\n\nAnother example is the [[black drongo]]s and the [[cattle egret]]s found in [[India]]. These birds feed on insects on the back of cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free. Destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases.\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tamiasciurus douglasii 000.jpg|thumb|A [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasii)'']]\n{{See also|Nature documentary}}\nWildlife has long been a common subject for [[education]]al [[television show]]s.

M. (1989). Overview of recent extinctions. Conservation for the Twenty-first Century. D. Western and M. Pearl, New York, Oxford University Press: 37-41.</ref>\n\n===Overkill===\nOverkill happens whenever hunting occurs at rates greater than the reproductive capacity of the population is being exploited. The effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow growing populations such as many larger [[species]] of fish. Initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted, an increased availability of resources (food, etc.) is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as [[Density dependence|density dependent]] inhibition is lowered. Hunting, [[fishing]] and so on, has lowered the competition between members of a population. However, if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young, the population will begin to [[resource depletion|decrease in numbers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/critical-species/|title=Critical Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519025342/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/critical-species/|archivedate=19 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPopulations that are confined to islands, whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an \"island\" for the species concerned, have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population rise of deaths declines following [[Unsustainable fishing methods|unsustainable hunting]].\n\n===Habitat destruction and fragmentation===\n{{main|Habitat destruction|Habitat fragmentation}}\n[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Deforestation]] and increased road-building in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]\nThe [[habitat]] of any given species is considered its preferred area or [[Territory (animal)|territory]]. Many processes associated with human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species. In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape. Agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented, or relictual, habitat. Farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.\n\nExamples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals, changes to natural fire regimes, forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion.\n\n===Impact of introduced species===\n{{main|Introduced species}}\n{{see also|Invasive species}}\n[[Mice]], [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[dandelion]]s and [[poison ivy]] are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world. Frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out-of-control invasions in distant but similar climates. The reasons for this have not always been clear and [[Charles Darwin]] felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place in which they had not evolved. The reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully. Occasionally, however, some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly, having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment of which they have become part.\n\n===Chains of extinction===\nThis final group is one of secondary effects. All wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them. Large [[herbivorous]] animals such as the [[hippopotamus]] have populations of [[insectivorous]] birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo. Should the hippo die out, so too will these groups of [[birds]], leading to further destruction as other species dependent on the birds are affected. Also referred to as a [[domino effect]], this series of [[chain reaction]]s is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any [[Biocoenosis|ecological community]].\n\nAnother example is the [[black drongo]]s and the [[cattle egret]]s found in [[India]]. These birds feed on insects on the back of cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free. Destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases.\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tamiasciurus douglasii 000.jpg|thumb|A [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasii)'']]\n{{See also|Nature documentary}}\nWildlife has long been a common subject for [[education]]al [[television show]]s.
