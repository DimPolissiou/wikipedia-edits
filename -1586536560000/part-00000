The second refers to the [[motion picture]] and graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' which the Five Stars Movement frequently relates with its principles of political renewal (the logo of the movement shares the use of a red V symbol with the franchise). The third refers to the interjection \"''vaffanculo''\" (\"fuck you!\") directed at bad policy. The fourth is a reference to the Roman numeral for five.\n\nV-Day, which continued the \"Clean Parliament\" initiative promoted by Grillo since 2006, took place in many Italian cities on 8 September 2007 to evoke the state of confusion caused by the [[Badoglio Proclamation]] on 8 September 1943. On that day, 336,000 signatures were collected, far exceeding the 50,000 required to file a popular initiative law. For the occasion, [[Michele Serra]] coined the term ''grillismo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/08/sezioni/cronaca/grillo-v-day/serra-commento/serra-commento.html?ref=search |title=La piazza di Grillo tra politica e populismo - cronaca |work=la Repubblica |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>\n \nV2-Day was organised for 25 April 2008, a second day of action aimed at collecting signatures for three referenda.

The first is the idea that the people can express their feelings of \"Vaffanculo\" which literally translates as \"Fuck off!\" aimed at the entirety of the political class.

The first refers to the [[Normandy landings]] of the Allies in [[Normandy]] during [[World War II]] in order to symbolise how Italian citizens would \"invade\" bad policy. The second refers to the [[motion picture]] and graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' which the Five Stars Movement frequently relates with its principles of political renewal (the logo of the movement shares the use of a red V symbol with the franchise). The third refers to the interjection \"''vaffanculo''\" (\"fuck you!\") directed at bad policy. The fourth is a reference to the Roman numeral for five.\n\nV-Day, which continued the \"Clean Parliament\" initiative promoted by Grillo since 2006, took place in many Italian cities on 8 September 2007 to evoke the state of confusion caused by the [[Badoglio Proclamation]] on 8 September 1943. On that day, 336,000 signatures were collected, far exceeding the 50,000 required to file a popular initiative law. For the occasion, [[Michele Serra]] coined the term ''grillismo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/08/sezioni/cronaca/grillo-v-day/serra-commento/serra-commento.html?ref=search |title=La piazza di Grillo tra politica e populismo - cronaca |work=la Repubblica |accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>\n \nV2-Day was organised for 25 April 2008, a second day of action aimed at collecting signatures for three referenda.

The first is the idea that the people can express their feelings of \"Vaffanculo\" which literally translates as \"Fuck off!\" aimed at the entirety of the political class.

Author Fabio Bordignon states that the very first battles of Beppe Grillo's \"people\" had their roots relating to but not exclusively:  environmentalism and renewable energy; the problems of poverty and precarious employment; the battles against the power of big business and the effects of [[globalization]]; the morality of the political sphere and civil rights.

His results were that the M5S ranks 1st among other parties in [[Welfare|welfare expansion]], environmental protection, and market regulation, where welfare expansion meant the expansion of public social services (excludes education), environmental protection meant policies in favor of preserving/conserving the environment, and market regulation meant policies designed to create an equitable and open economic market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conti|first=Nicol\u00f2|last2=Memoli|first2=Vincenzo|date=13 January 2015|title=The Emergence of a New Party in the Italian Party System: Rise and Fortunes of the Five Star Movement|journal=West European Politics|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=516\u2013534|doi=10.1080/01402382.2014.996377|issn=0140-2382}}</ref>\n\n===Politics is not a career===\nOne of the most important rules of M5S is that politics is a temporary service: no one who has already been elected twice at any level (local or national) can be a candidate again and has to return to their original job.<ref name=\"utopia\"/> Another feature of the movement is the so-called \"zero-cost politics\",<ref name=\"Zero-Cost Politics\"/> according to which politics must not become a career and way to make money.

The article does not explain how Favia got to deduct that amount because it necessarily includes reimbursements and per diem is not flat as costs and expenses which vary from member to member.<ref>{{cite web|author=Redazione Il Fatto Quotidiano |url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/11/27/stipendi-5-stelle-favia-critica-grillo-tagli-irrisori-per-nostri-deputati-3000-euro/428510/ |title=Stipendi 5 Stelle, Favia critica Grillo: \"Tagli irrisori, 3000 euro di stipendio bastano\" |work=Il Fatto Quotidiano |accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the expulsion of Giovanni Favia and Federica Salsi for expressing views about the lack of internal democracy, the party has expelled several  members for criticisms.<ref>://www.corriere.it/politica/12_dicembre_12/a-giovanni-favia-e-salsi-ritirato-logo-movimento-cinque-stelle_1e5e2710-4442-11e2-a26e-c89e7517e938.shtml</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2012-12-12/niente-dissenso-grillo-espelle-115756.shtml?uuid=AbklfKBH |title=Niente dissenso: E Grillo espelle dal M5S gli \"eretici\" Salsi e Favia |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |date= 12 December 2012|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> The expulsions were made unilaterally by Grillo and as per regulation took place without prior consultation with members of the movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2012/12/12/news/grillo_caccia_favia_e_salsi_dal_movimento_5_stelle-48579921/?ref=HREA-1 |title=Grillo caccia Favia e Salsi dal Movimento 5 Stelle |work=la Repubblica |accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/12/12/news/m5s_grillo-48580195/ |title=Grillo \"scomunica\" Favia e Salsi L'eletta: \"Peggio che nei vecchi partiti\" - Bologna - Repubblica.it |work=la Repubblica |accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Emanuele Buzzi |url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/12_dicembre_14/bufera-grillini-logo_7c9ac632-45b7-11e2-9abc-e1073f0961e6.shtml |title=Bufera sui grillini Avvocati in campo per l'uso del logo |work=Corriere della Sera |accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother criticism frequently made by the same movement activists and former activists, such as [[Federico Pistono]], social entrepreneur and author of ''Robots Will Steal Your Job, But That's OK: How to Survive the Economic Collapse and Be Happy'' and former member,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_aa7f40ba01014fy3.html |title=Interview with Federico, author of \"Robots Will Steal Your Job, but That's OK\" |date=21 December 2012 |publisher=Sina Corp |language=English, Chinese |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref> is about the absence of any form of effective participation on the web.<ref>{{cite web |author=Riccardo Guerrera |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/listeciviche/forum/2013/01/grillo-casaleggio-dove-il-portale-promesso-abbiamo-aspettato-3-anni-almeno-dateci-una-data-di-rilasc.html |title=Grillo, Casaleggio, dov'\u00e8 il Portale promesso ???

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]].

[[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]]. The fourth season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by ''All Stars'' season three winner, [[Trixie Mattel]], with eliminated AS4 contestant [[Manila Luzon]] subbing for her in the finale episode. Luzon also hosted the Pit Stop for season eleven. The current host of the show is [[Bob the Drag Queen]], winner of Season 8.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of RuPaul's Drag Race episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"height: 4em;\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season\n!

The show documents [[RuPaul]] in the search for \"America's next [[drag queen|drag]] superstar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/rupauls-drag-race/201|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403120950/http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/rupauls-drag-race/201|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 3, 2012|title=\"RuPaul's Drag Race\"!|accessdate=October 12, 2011|last=Hughes|first=Scarlett|date=May 16, 2008|work=Right TV|publisher=}}</ref> RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]]. On the [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] of ''All Stars'', \"synergy\" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).\n\n===''Untucked''===\n{{Main|RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked}}\nThe first season of ''Drag Race'' was accompanied by a seven-episode [[web series]], titled ''Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race''. [[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]]. The fourth season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by ''All Stars'' season three winner, [[Trixie Mattel]], with eliminated AS4 contestant [[Manila Luzon]] subbing for her in the finale episode. Luzon also hosted the Pit Stop for season eleven. The current host of the show is [[Bob the Drag Queen]], winner of Season 8.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of RuPaul's Drag Race episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"height: 4em;\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season\n!
