The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

Howard''' is a [[sociologist]] and communication researcher who studies the impact of information technologies on [[democracy]] and [[social inequality]]. He studies how new information technologies are used in both civic engagement and social control in countries around the world.  He is Professor of Internet Studies at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] and [[Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/philip-howard/</ref> He is the author of eight books, including ''New Media Campaigns and The Managed Citizen'', ''The Digital Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'', and ''Pax Technica: How the Internet of Things May Set Us Free or Lock Us Up''.<ref>http://philhoward.org/about/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philip-N.-Howard/e/B001IU11FO/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1515841317&sr=8-1</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nPhilip N. Howard was born in [[Montreal]] in 1970. He is married to [[Gina Neff]], also a professor at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]], and they have two sons.\n\nHoward has been a Fellow at the [[Pew Internet & American Life Project]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[London School of Economics]]' Stanhope Centre for Communications Policy Research, [[Stanford University]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], and [[Princeton University]]'s [[Center for Information Technology Policy]]. In 2013 he moved to Budapest, Hungary where he helped to found the [[School of Public Policy at Central European University]]. He has courtesy appointments or fellowships with the Department of Communication at the University of Washington and the [[Center for Media, Data and Society]] at [[Central European University]] and Columbia University's [[Tow Center for Digital Journalism]].\n\n==Research==\n\nHis research has demonstrated that the diffusion of [[digital media]] has long-term, often positive, implications for democratic institutions. Through [[information infrastructure]], some young democracies have become more entrenched and durable; some [[authoritarian]] regimes have made significant transitions towards democratic institutions and practices; and others have become less authoritarian and hybrid where information technologies support the work of particular actors such as [[Sovereign state|state]], [[political parties]], [[journalists]], or [[civil society]] groups.\n\n===Astroturf campaigns and fake news===\n\nHoward was one of the first to investigate the impact of digital media on political campaigning in advanced democracies, and he was the first political scientist to define and study \"astroturf\" political movements as the managed perception of grassroots support through [[astroturfing]] in his research on the Gore and Bush presidential campaigns.

Howard''' is a [[sociologist]] and communication researcher who studies the impact of information technologies on [[democracy]] and [[social inequality]]. He studies how new information technologies are used in both civic engagement and social control in countries around the world.  He is Professor of Internet Studies at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] and [[Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/philip-howard/</ref> He is the author of eight books, including ''New Media Campaigns and The Managed Citizen'', ''The Digital Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'', and ''Pax Technica: How the Internet of Things May Set Us Free or Lock Us Up''.<ref>http://philhoward.org/about/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philip-N.-Howard/e/B001IU11FO/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1515841317&sr=8-1</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nPhilip N. Howard was born in [[Montreal]] in 1970. He is married to [[Gina Neff]], also a professor at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]], and they have two sons.\n\nHoward has been a Fellow at the [[Pew Internet & American Life Project]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[London School of Economics]]' Stanhope Centre for Communications Policy Research, [[Stanford University]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], and [[Princeton University]]'s [[Center for Information Technology Policy]]. In 2013 he moved to Budapest, Hungary where he helped to found the [[School of Public Policy at Central European University]]. He has courtesy appointments or fellowships with the Department of Communication at the University of Washington and the [[Center for Media, Data and Society]] at [[Central European University]] and Columbia University's [[Tow Center for Digital Journalism]].\n\n==Research==\n\nHis research has demonstrated that the diffusion of [[digital media]] has long-term, often positive, implications for democratic institutions. Through [[information infrastructure]], some young democracies have become more entrenched and durable; some [[authoritarian]] regimes have made significant transitions towards democratic institutions and practices; and others have become less authoritarian and hybrid where information technologies support the work of particular actors such as [[Sovereign state|state]], [[political parties]], [[journalists]], or [[civil society]] groups.\n\n===Astroturf Campaigns and Fake News===\n\nHoward was one of the first to investigate the impact of digital media on political campaigning in advanced democracies, and he was the first political scientist to define and study \"astroturf\" political movements as the managed perception of grassroots support through [[astroturfing]] in his research on the Gore and Bush presidential campaigns.

Lignin is also stable, and contains aromatic rings. It is both elastic and viscous yet flows smoothly in the liquid phase.  Most importantly lignin can improve on the current standards of plastics because it is antimicrobial in nature.<ref name=\"Thakur2014\" /> It is being produced at such great quantities and is readily available for use as an emerging environmentally friendly polymer.\n\n===Petroleum-based plastics===\nPetroleum-based plastics are derived from petrochemicals, which are obtained from fossil crude oil, coal or natural gas. The most widely used petroleum-based plastics such as [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), [[polyethylene]] (PE), [[polypropylene]] (PP), and [[polystyrene]] (PS) are not biodegradable. However, the following petroleum-based plastics listed are. \n\n==== Polyglycolic acid (PGA) ====\n[[Polyglycolide|Polyglycolic acid]] is a thermoplastic polymer and an aliphatic polyester. PGA is often used in medical applications such as PGA sutures for its biodegradability. The ester linkage in the backbone of polyglycolic acid gives it hydrolytic instability. Thus polyglycolic acid can degrade into its nontoxic monomer, glycolic acid, through hydrolysis. This process can be expedited with esterases. In the body, glycolic acid can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle, after which can be excreted as water and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=CSIRO Molecular Science, Bag 10, Clayton South MDC, Vic 3169, Australia|last2=Gunatillake|first2=Pa|date=2003-10-01|title=Biodegradable synthetic polymers for tissue engineering|journal=European Cells and Materials|volume=5|pages=1\u201316|doi=10.22203/eCM.v005a01|pmid=14562275|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Polybutylene succinate (PBS) ====\n[[Polybutylene succinate]] is a thermoplastic polymer resin that has properties comparable to [[propylene]].

Additionally, companies that label plastics with oxo-biodegradable additives as entirely biodegradable contribute to misinformation. Similarly, some brands may claim that their plastics are biodegradable when, in fact, they are non-biodegradable bioplastics.\n\n== Environmental impacts ==\n===Environmental benefits===\n'''Microbial degradation:''' The primary purpose of biodegradable plastics is to replace traditional plastics that persist in landfills and harm the environment. Therefore, the ability of microorganisms to break down these plastics is an incredible environmental advantage. Microbial degradation is accomplished by 3 steps: colonization of the plastic surface, hydrolysis, and mineralization. First, microorganisms populate the exposed plastics. Next, the bacteria secrete enzymes that bind to the carbon source or polymer substrates and then split the hydrocarbon bonds. The process results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>. Despite the release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the environment, biodegradable plastics leave a smaller footprint than petroleum-based plastics that accumulate in landfills and cause heavy pollution, which is why they are explored as alternatives to traditional plastics.<ref name=\"Tokiwa 3722\u20133742\"/>\n\n'''Municipal solid waste:''' According to a 2010 report of the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) the US had 31 million tons of plastic waste, representing 12.4% of all municipal solid waste. Of that, 2.55 million tons were recovered. This 8.2% recovery was much less than the 34.1% overall recovery percentage for municipal solid waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|title=Municipal Waste Factsheet|publisher=EPA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801063035/http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|archive-date=1 August 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDepressed plastics recovery rates can be attributed to conventional plastics are often commingled with organic wastes (food scraps, wet paper, and liquids), leading to accumulation of waste in landfills and natural habitats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Richard C.|last2=Moore|first2=Charles J.|last3=Saal|first3=Frederick S. vom|last4=Swan|first4=Shanna|date=14 June 2009|title=Plastics, the environment and human health: current consensus and future trends|journal=Phil.

Rather than worrying about recycling a relatively small quantity of commingled plastics, proponents argue that certified biodegradable plastics can be readily commingled with other organic wastes, thereby enabling composting of a much larger portion of nonrecoverable solid waste.\n\nCommercial composting for all mixed organics then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable. More municipalities can divert significant quantities of waste from overburdened landfills since the entire waste stream is now biodegradable and therefore easier to process. This move away from the use of landfills may help alleviate the issue of [[plastic pollution]].\n\nThe use of biodegradable plastics, therefore, is seen as enabling the complete recovery of large quantities of municipal solid waste (via aerobic composting and feedstocks) that have heretofore been unrecoverable by other means except land filling or incineration.<ref>Hermes, Jennifer.

This design triggered innovation into what is being engineered as of the year 2019. The current biodegradable CPs is applicable for use in the biomedical field. The compositional architecture of current biodegradable CPs includes the conductivity properties of oligomer-based biodegradable polymers implemented into compositions of linear, starshaped, or hyperbranched formations. Another implementation to enhance the biodegradable architecture of the CPs is by use of monomers and conjugated links that are degradable.<ref name=\":8\" /> The biodegradable polymers used in biomedical applications typically consist of hydrolyzable esters and hydrazones. These molecules, upon external stimulation, go on to be cleaved and broken down. The cleaving activation process can be achieved through use of an acidic environment, increasing the temperature, or by use of enzymes.<ref name=\":8\" /> Three categories of biodegradable CP composites have been established in relation their chemistry makeup. The first category includes partially biodegradable CP blends of conductive and biodegradable polymeric materials. The second category includes conducting oligomers of biodegradable CPs.

Additionally, companies that label plastics with oxo-biodegradable additives as entirely biodegradable contribute to misinformation. Similarly, some brands may claim that their plastics are biodegradable when, in fact, they are non-biodegradable bioplastics.\n\n== Environmental impacts ==\n===Environmental benefits===\n'''Microbial degradation:''' The primary purpose of biodegradable plastics is to replace traditional plastics that persist in landfills and harm the environment. Therefore, the ability of microorganisms to break down these plastics is an incredible environmental advantage. Microbial degradation is accomplished by 3 steps: colonization of the plastic surface, hydrolysis, and mineralization. First, microorganisms populate the exposed plastics. Next, the bacteria secrete enzymes that bind to the carbon source or polymer substrates and then split the hydrocarbon bonds. The process results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>. Despite the release of CO<sub>2</sub> into the environment, biodegradable plastics leave a smaller footprint than petroleum-based plastics that accumulate in landfills and cause heavy pollution, which is why they are explored as alternatives to traditional plastics.<ref name=\"Tokiwa 3722\u20133742\"/>\n\n'''Municipal solid waste:''' According to a 2010 report of the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) the US had 31 million tons of plastic waste, representing 12.4% of all municipal solid waste. Of that, 2.55 million tons were recovered. This 8.2% recovery was much less than the 34.1% overall recovery percentage for municipal solid waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|title=Municipal Waste Factsheet|publisher=EPA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801063035/http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw_2010_rev_factsheet.pdf|archive-date=1 August 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDepressed plastics recovery rates can be attributed to conventional plastics are often commingled with organic wastes (food scraps, wet paper, and liquids), leading to accumulation of waste in landfills and natural habitats.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Richard C.|last2=Moore|first2=Charles J.|last3=Saal|first3=Frederick S. vom|last4=Swan|first4=Shanna|date=14 June 2009|title=Plastics, the environment and human health: current consensus and future trends|journal=Phil.

Rather than worrying about recycling a relatively small quantity of commingled plastics, proponents argue that certified biodegradable plastics can be readily commingled with other organic wastes, thereby enabling composting of a much larger portion of nonrecoverable solid waste.\n\nCommercial composting for all mixed organics then becomes commercially viable and economically sustainable. More municipalities can divert significant quantities of waste from overburdened landfills since the entire waste stream is now biodegradable and therefore easier to process. This move away from the use of landfills may help alleviate the issue of [[plastic pollution]].\n\nThe use of biodegradable plastics, therefore, is seen as enabling the complete recovery of large quantities of municipal solid waste (via aerobic composting and feedstocks) that have heretofore been unrecoverable by other means except land filling or incineration.<ref>Hermes, Jennifer.

This design triggered innovation into what is being engineered as of the year 2019. The current biodegradable CPs is applicable for use in the biomedical field. The compositional architecture of current biodegradable CPs includes the conductivity properties of oligomer-based biodegradable polymers implemented into compositions of linear, starshaped, or hyperbranched formations. Another implementation to enhance the biodegradable architecture of the CPs is by use of monomers and conjugated links that are degradable.<ref name=\":8\" /> The biodegradable polymers used in biomedical applications typically consist of hydrolyzable esters and hydrazones. These molecules, upon external stimulation, go on to be cleaved and broken down. The cleaving activation process can be achieved through use of an acidic environment, increasing the temperature, or by use of enzymes.<ref name=\":8\" /> Three categories of biodegradable CP composites have been established in relation their chemistry makeup. The first category includes partially biodegradable CP blends of conductive and biodegradable polymeric materials. The second category includes conducting oligomers of biodegradable CPs. The third category is that of modified and degradable monimer units along with use of degradable conjugated links for use in biodegradable CPs polymers.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Gold Nanoparticle-Integrated Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine\nMoran Yadid, Ron Feiner, and Tal Dvir\nNano Letters 2019 19 (4), 2198-2206\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00472\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biodegradation]]\n* [[Biodegradable bags]]\n* [[Biodegradable waste]]\n* [[Biodegradable additives]]\n* [[Bioplastic]]\n* [[BioSphere Plastic]]\n* [[Economics of plastics processing]]\n* [[Microplastics]]\n* [[Photodegradation]]\n* [[Plastic bag]]\n* [[Plastics 2020 Challenge]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/7468/-Biodegradable_Plastics_and_Marine_Litter_Misconceptions,_concerns_and_impacts_on_marine_environments-2015BiodegradablePlasticsAndMarineLitter.pdf.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y Biodegradable Plastics and Marine Litter]\n* [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.7b04051 Biodegradability of Plastics: Challenges and Misconceptions]\n*{{Cite book|title=Green plastics : an introduction to the new science of biodegradable plastics|last=Stevens|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Stevens|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691049670|location=Princeton|oclc=47162140|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greenplasticsint00stev}}\n{{Subject bar|portal1=Ecology|portal3=Technology}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Thakur2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Thakur | first1 =Vijay Kumar | last2 = Thakur | first2 = Manju Kumari |last3 = Raghavan |first3 = Prasanth |last4 = Kessler |first4 = Michael R.  | authorlink = | title = Progress in Green Polymer Composites from Lignin for Multifunctional Applications: A Review | journal = ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 1072\u20132019 | publisher = [[ACS Publications]] | year = 2014 | issn = | doi = 10.1021/sc500087z | id = }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Taniguchi_PET\">{{cite journal | last1 = Taniguchi | first1 = Ikuo | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = Shosuke | last3 = Hiraga | first3 = Kazumi | last4 = Miyamoto | first4 = Kenji | last5 = Kimura | first5 = Yoshiharu | last6 = Oda | first6 = Kohei | authorlink = | title = Biodegradation of PET: Current Status and Application Aspects | journal = ACS Catalysis | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 4089\u20134105 | publisher = [[ACS Publications]] | year = 2019 | issn = | doi = 10.1021/acscatal.8b05171 | id = }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Packaging}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biodegradable Plastic}}\n[[Category:Biodegradable plastics| ]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic"}
