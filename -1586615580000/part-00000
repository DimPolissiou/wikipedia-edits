John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]) despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Dromeane alias Dromeightragh''.

He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]) despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Dromeane alias Dromeightragh''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

He was one of three brothers and two sisters. When Morales was thirteen years old, he made his first [[musical composition]], a song called ''Solo he Quedado'' (\"''Alone I'm Left''\"). Although it was never recorded, it was the song that drove him into music, and soon afterwards his father gave him a guitar to aid his creativity.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Kaleth wrote a number of successful singles that were [[cover versions|cover]]ed by different groups.<ref>RadioUno.com.co ''[http://www.radiouno.com.co/noticia.php3?nt=25 Biography: Kaleth Morales]'' {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927024458/http://www.radiouno.com.co/noticia.php3?nt=25 |date=2007-09-27 }}. 2005; retrieved 24 August 24.</ref> His song \"Novios Cruzados\" (\"Crossed Lovers\") was coverded by [[Los Diablitos]], \"No Aguanta\" (\"It Doesn't Hold\"), \"No Ser\u00e9 Tu Payaso\" (\"I Won't Be Your Clown\") by [[Los Gigantes]], and \"Mi Reina Consentida\" (\"My Spoiled Queen\") by his father, among others. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 2003 he released his first single, \"Voy a Atraparte\" (\"I'm Gonna Catch You\") with the accordionist [[Manuel Juli\u00e1n]]. The single proved to be an instant hit because of its fresh, playful take on traditional vallenato music. His most famous song, \"Vivo En El Limbo\" (\"I Live in the Limbo\"), started as a simple tune he performed at parties, but quickly became popular when it received an official release in 2004, the same year he prepared his first album for Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The album, \"La Hora de la Verdad\" (\"The Hour of Truth\"), was released in 2005. The album's singles, \"Vivo En El Limbo\" and \"La Hora de la Verdad\", were sold around [[Ecuador]] and [[Venezuela]], where they are still popular today. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAccording to Morales, he was inspired by, ''\"Everyday stories, my friend's lives, my own experience and even my mother... from  my father I have learnt that you have to value the backup from the media and be thankful to the people that backs me {{sic}} up.

He was one of three brothers and two sisters. When Morales was thirteen years old, he made his first [[musical composition]], a song called ''Solo he Quedado'' (\"''Alone I'm Left''\"). Although it was never recorded, it was the song that drove him into music, and soon afterwards his father gave him a guitar to aid his creativity.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Kaleth wrote a number of successful singles that were [[cover versions|cover]]ed by different groups.<ref>RadioUno.com.co ''[http://www.radiouno.com.co/noticia.php3?nt=25 Biography: Kaleth Morales''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927024458/http://www.radiouno.com.co/noticia.php3?nt=25 |date=2007-09-27 }}. 2005; retrieved 24 August 24.</ref> His song \"Novios Cruzados\" (\"Crossed Lovers\") was coverded by [[Los Diablitos]], \"No Aguanta\" (\"It Doesn't Hold\"), \"No Ser\u00e9 Tu Payaso\" (\"I Won't Be Your Clown\") by [[Los Gigantes]], and \"Mi Reina Consentida\" (\"My Spoiled Queen\") by his father, among others. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 2003 he released his first single, \"Voy a Atraparte\" (\"I'm Gonna Catch You\") with the accordionist [[Manuel Juli\u00e1n]]. The single proved to be an instant hit because of its fresh, playful take on traditional vallenato music. His most famous song, \"Vivo En El Limbo\" (\"I Live in the Limbo\"), started as a simple tune he performed at parties, but quickly became popular when it received an official release in 2004, the same year he prepared his first album for Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The album, \"La Hora de la Verdad\" (\"The Hour of Truth\"), was released in 2005. The album's singles, \"Vivo En El Limbo\" and \"La Hora de la Verdad\", were sold around [[Ecuador]] and [[Venezuela]], where they are still popular today. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAccording to Morales, he was inspired by, ''\"Everyday stories, my friend's lives, my own experience and even my mother... from  my father I have learnt that you have to value the backup from the media and be thankful to the people that backs me {{sic}} up. My style is based in {{sic}} romantic lyrics, but with fast and modern arrangements, it is what I call my own journey.\"'' <ref>ElVallenato.com ''[http://www.elvallenato.com/artistas/artista.php?artista=17&bio=1&mas=Kaleth%20Morales Biograf\u00eda de Kaleth Morales''].

Kaleth suffered serious trauma whilst his brother suffered less serious injuries. They were sent to Bocagrande Hospital in Cartagena. Doctors confirmed Morales' death on the morning of 24 August due to a marked brain [[edema]], with a deep parietal [[contusion]].
