Most probably,Bowman arrived in London penniless and with few acquaintances. However, at some point he rented a room from a widow named Mrs. Walter Channing Bridgen at 2 Cleveland Street, Buckingham, a place where several American artists including [[Charles Robert Leslie]] (1794-1859), [[Washington Allston]] (1779-1843), [[Thomas Sully]] (1783-1872), [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] (1791-1872),and [[Charles Bird King]] (1785-1862) had previously lived or dined.<ref>Neal, John. \"American Painters Abroad,\" ''Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette'', October, 1829, 181.</ref> In addition Bowman was asked to paint \"some of the most distinguished families in the kingdom, among which,were those of the Lord Chancellor, and of Gov.

It certainly appears Bowman met and became friends with several portrait and landscape artists working at the time in London. These included Charles Robert Leslie, Samuel F. B. Morse and [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]] (1792-1866).\n\nIt is through Chester Harding's diary kept during his first visit to England, selections of which were published in 1866 by his daughter, Margaret Eliot Harding White, that one learns some of the details of Bowman's life in England and of his first visit to Paris.<ref>Harding, Chester and Margaret Eliot Harding White, ''My Egotistigraphy'', Cambridge, J. Wilson & Son, 1979.</ref> By the winter of 1825 Bowman had moved to Birmingham when he stayed with the family of Mr. Van Wert, the brother-in-law of Washington Irving, and opened a gallery of paintings or studio there.<ref name=\"Crawford\"/>\n\nA footnote to a letter by Nathaniel Carter indicates that he met Bowman for a second time in the winter of 1827 in Paris and that Bowman was on his way to Italy \"where a study of the great masters of that country, added to his native genius and self-acquired proficiency, cannot fail to render him eminent in his profession. He (Bowman) took a likeness of General LaFayette, which is in the highest degree creditable to his pencil.\"<ref>Carter, Nathaniel, ''Letters from Europe, Comprising the Journal of a Tour through Ireland, England, Scotland, France, Italy, and Switzerland in the Years 1825, '26, and '27'',New York, G. & C. Carvill, 1827, 356.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Harding's description of Bowman's lack of recognition at the time at least two accounts indicate that he was spoken of highly by important artists and critical art journals. Sir Thomas Lawrence is quoted as saying \"I do most sincerely believe that Bowman will, at no distant day, supply the vacuum, which has been caused, in the world of the arts, by the demise of our lamented West, and sustain the high reputation which that great master of our art, acquired not only for himself and his country, but for England and the age.\"<ref name=\"Crawford\"/> Sir Lawrence is said to have recommended Bowman to the Bishop of Worcester as \"one of the few painters in the kingdom who could do complete justice to a portrait of that functionary\".<ref name=\"Wilson_863\"/> The ''London Museum'' is mentioned as just one of the critical art journals which noticed his work in 1825,<ref name=\"Wilson_863\"/> though at the very same time his portraits were rejected by the London exhibitions.\n\nProbably sometime in 1827 Bowman went to Paris where he became acquainted with the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], as it is said that he lived with Lafayette's family for nine months.<ref name=\"Wilson_863\"/> It was during this time that he must have painted a portrait of Lafayette and his daughters later displayed in Charleston, South Carolina,<ref name=\"CityGazette\">''The City Gazette & Commercial Daily Advertiser'' February 25, 1830, vol.

Bowman painted a portrait of Cooper which was also displayed in his studio in Charleston South Carolina where a visitor described it.<ref>\"Portraits of Bowman and Rand,\" ''The Charleston Courier'' April 5, 1831, vol. xxix, no. 9568, 2.</ref> Perhaps a year later Bowman went to Italy for additional study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. In 1828 he painted a three quarter length portrait of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], the Danish sculptor, which Bowman considered his chef d\u2019oeuvre. Having completed his study in Italy, Bowman returned to France late in 1828 before returning to the United States, possibly via New Orleans, where he intended to spend the winter painting portraits.<ref>\"Mr. Bowman-The American Painter.\" ''Daily National Intelligencer'' (Washington, D.C.), November 26, 1828, issue 4938, col.

Bowman established a studio in the Arcade in Rochester where he was well-liked in the community, and considered a particularly fine artist for having studied abroad. A Canadian artist, [[Cornelius Krieghoff]] was also painting in Rochester and probably due to common experiences in Canada, and a common interest in music, they became close friends.<ref>McIntosh, W. H., ''History of Monroe County. New York'', Philadelphia: Everts, Ensign, & Everts, 1877, 141.</ref> Bowman, with more painting experience, allowed Krieghoff to copy his portrait of Thorvaldsen and also one of a French notary.<ref>Reid, Dennis R., ''Krieghoff : Images of Canada'', Toronto: Art Gallery of Ontario, 1999, 49</ref> Krieghoff's copy of the Thorvaldsen portrait was offered at Parke-Bernet, New York March 14, 1968, but the present location of the painting is unknown. Krieghoff's copy of a second portrait which he titled ''Notary with a Red Skull Cap'' is owned by the Beaverbrook Art Gallery Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. A very similar portrait by [[Paul Kane]] is reported by Harper to be owned by Kane's descendants and is believed perhaps to also have a common source in a painting by Bowman.<ref>Harper (1979), p. 10.</ref> Now in a private collection, ''The Man in the Red Hat'' is an oil portrait by Bowman, which is most likely this common source.\n\nBowman's death on May 18, 1842 at 2 am was unexpected and seems to have shocked the community. His death was announced the next day in the ''Daily Advertiser'' with the headline \"Sudden Death!\"<ref>\"Sudden Death!\" ''Daily Advertiser'' (Rochester, NY), May 19, 1842.</ref> He died in his bed at the Mansion House after a \"short but severe illness\".

V, no. 90, October 28, 1834.</ref> there is little evidence that Bowman did study with Lawrence except for Bowman's entry in ''Artists in Ohio 1787-1900'' which states that he \"\u2026 received, by his own account, some lessons from Sir Thomas Lawrence in London.\"<ref>Haverstock, Mary Sayre and others, ''Artists in Ohio, 1787-1900: A Biographical Dictionary'', Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 2000, 106.</ref> According to Garlick,<ref>Lawrence, Sir Thomas and Kenneth Garlick, ''Sir Thomas Lawrence'', Boston: Boston Book & Art Shop, 1955, 17-18.</ref> Sir Thomas Lawrence had paying pupils who received little training, but were allowed to make copies and ask for advice. It certainly appears Bowman met and became friends with several portrait and landscape artists working at the time in London. These included Charles Robert Leslie, Samuel F. B. Morse and [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]] (1792-1866).\n\nIt is through Chester Harding's diary kept during his first visit to England, selections of which were published in 1866 by his daughter, Margaret Eliot Harding White, that one learns some of the details of Bowman's life in England and of his first visit to Paris.<ref>Harding, Chester and Margaret Eliot Harding White, ''My Egotistigraphy'', Cambridge, J. Wilson & Son, 1979.</ref> By the winter of 1825 Bowman had moved to Birmingham when he stayed with the family of Mr. Van Wert, the brother-in-law of Washington Irving, and opened a gallery of paintings or studio there.<ref name=\"Crawford\"/>\n\nA footnote to a letter by Nathaniel Carter indicates that he met Bowman for a second time in the winter of 1827 in Paris and that Bowman was on his way to Italy \"where a study of the great masters of that country, added to his native genius and self-acquired proficiency, cannot fail to render him eminent in his profession. He (Bowman) took a likeness of General LaFayette, which is in the highest degree creditable to his pencil.\"<ref>Carter, Nathaniel, ''Letters from Europe, Comprising the Journal of a Tour through Ireland, England, Scotland, France, Italy, and Switzerland in the Years 1825, '26, and '27'',New York, G. & C. Carvill, 1827, 356.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Harding's description of Bowman's lack of recognition at the time at least two accounts indicate that he was spoken of highly by important artists and critical art journals. Sir Thomas Lawrence is quoted as saying \"I do most sincerely believe that Bowman will, at no distant day, supply the vacuum, which has been caused, in the world of the arts, by the demise of our lamented West, and sustain the high reputation which that great master of our art, acquired not only for himself and his country, but for England and the age.\"<ref name=\"Crawford\"/> Sir Lawrence is said to have recommended Bowman to the Bishop of Worcester as \"one of the few painters in the kingdom who could do complete justice to a portrait of that functionary\".<ref name=\"Wilson_863\"/> The ''London Museum'' is mentioned as just one of the critical art journals which noticed his work in 1825,<ref name=\"Wilson_863\"/> though at the very same time his portraits were rejected by the London exhibitions.\n\nProbably sometime in 1827 Bowman went to Paris where he became acquainted with the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], as it is said that he lived with Lafayette's family for nine months.<ref name=\"Wilson_863\"/> It was during this time that he must have painted a portrait of Lafayette and his daughters later displayed in Charleston, South Carolina,<ref name=\"CityGazette\">''The City Gazette & Commercial Daily Advertiser'' February 25, 1830, vol. LIII, no. 47, 2.</ref> and perhaps others of the Marquis. A friend and frequent guest of Lafayette's was the American novelist [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. Bowman painted a portrait of Cooper which was also displayed in his studio in Charleston South Carolina where a visitor described it.<ref>\"Portraits of Bowman and Rand,\" ''The Charleston Courier'' April 5, 1831, vol. xxix, no. 9568, 2.</ref> Perhaps a year later Bowman went to Italy for additional study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. In 1828 he painted a three quarter length portrait of [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], the Danish sculptor, which Bowman considered his chef d\u2019oeuvre. Having completed his study in Italy, Bowman returned to France late in 1828 before returning to the United States, possibly via New Orleans, where he intended to spend the winter painting portraits.<ref>\"Mr. Bowman-The American Painter.\" ''Daily National Intelligencer'' (Washington, D.C.), November 26, 1828, issue 4938, col.

He was to stay ten to twelve days before going to Washington to paint the \"President of the United States to be transmitted to Gen.

Bowman and Waugh agreed to study together in Italy at some future date. According to the Patriot (December 5, 1834) Bowman and Waugh planned to go to Rome in the spring of 1835 where Bowman was to deliver the ''Chapel of Indian Church of Two Mountains'' painting to the Pope, but instead Bowman moved to Detroit.<ref>\"Mr. Bowman.\" ''The Patriot'', December 5, 1834, vol. v, no. 101, 3.</ref> In late 1836 Kane also went to Detroit and was disappointed to find the trip to Rome cancelled due to Bowman's marriage.<ref>Kane, Paul and J.

There he gave lessons to his most famous pupil, [[John Mix Stanley]] (1814-1872) who became well known for his paintings of Native Americans and western landscapes.<ref>Gibson, Arthur Hopkins, ''Artists of Early Michigan: A Biographical Dictionary of Artists Native to or Active in Michigan, 1701-1900'', Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1975, 57.</ref> Bowman and Stanley formed a partnership to paint portraits and traveled together through Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin.<ref>''Artists of Michigan from the Nineteenth Century : A Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commemorating Michigan Statehood, 1837-1987'' : The Muskegon Museum of Art, the Detroit Historical Museum, eds.

As early artists in Chicago they opened a studio and art gallery.<ref>Gerdts (1990), p. 285.</ref> While there they gave lessons to [[Samuel Marsden Brookes]] (1816-1892) whose family immigrated to the city from Great Britain in 1833. Brookes later set himself up as a professional portrait painter and is thought to be the first resident artist in Chicago.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gerdts |first=William H. |year=1996 |title=\"Chicago is Rushing Past Everything\": The Rise of American Art Journalism in the Midwest, from the Development of the Railroad to the Chicago Fire |journal=[[The American Art Journal]] |volume=27 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=38\u201383 |jstor=1594605}}</ref> In August 1837 Bowman again exhibited his ''Dioramic View of the Interior of the Capuchin Chapel at Rome'', having previously displayed it in Canada. For fifty cents Chicago residents could see this \"fine specimen of art from 10 am to 5 pm at the City Saloon.\"<ref>\"The Fine Arts\" ''Chicago Democrat'', August 15, 1837, v. 5.</ref> Sometime after August, 1837 Bowman (with or without Stanley) went to Green Bay, Wisconsin where he painted the Secretary and Governor of the Wisconsin Territory. These two portraits, [[William B. Slaughter]], and [[Henry Dodge]], are now owned by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin where they are listed as being painted in 1836.\n\n==Final move to Rochester and sudden death in May 1842==\nBy October, 1841, Bowman had moved on to Rochester, New York.<ref>Harper, John Russell, ''Krieghoff'' ,Toronto ; Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1979, 9.</ref> Sometime after he left Detroit Bowman moved his wife to his hometown of Mercer, Pennsylvania as a son James Bryan Bowman was born in Mercer on February 14, 1838, and a second son, William Josi Xifie Bowman was born in 1840. Bowman established a studio in the Arcade in Rochester where he was well-liked in the community, and considered a particularly fine artist for having studied abroad. A Canadian artist, [[Cornelius Krieghoff]] was also painting in Rochester and probably due to common experiences in Canada, and a common interest in music, they became close friends.<ref>McIntosh, W. H., ''History of Monroe County. New York'', Philadelphia: Everts, Ensign, & Everts, 1877, 141.</ref> Bowman, with more painting experience, allowed Krieghoff to copy his portrait of Thorvaldsen and also one of a French notary.<ref>Reid, Dennis R., ''Krieghoff : Images of Canada'', Toronto: Art Gallery of Ontario, 1999, 49</ref> Krieghoff's copy of the Thorvaldsen portrait was offered at Parke-Bernet, New York March 14, 1968, but the present location of the painting is unknown. Krieghoff's copy of a second portrait which he titled ''Notary with a Red Skull Cap'' is owned by the Beaverbrook Art Gallery Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. A very similar portrait by [[Paul Kane]] is reported by Harper to be owned by Kane's descendants and is believed perhaps to also have a common source in a painting by Bowman.<ref>Harper (1979), p. 10.</ref> Now in a private collection, ''The Man in the Red Hat'' is an oil portrait by Bowman, which is most likely this common source.\n\nBowman's death on May 18, 1842 at 2 am in the morning was unexpected and seems to have shocked the community. His death was announced the next day in the ''Daily Advertiser'' with the headline \"Sudden Death!\"<ref>\"Sudden Death!\" ''Daily Advertiser'' (Rochester, NY), May 19, 1842.</ref> He died in his bed at the Mansion House after a \"short but severe illness\". An obituary was printed in the ''Mercer (PA) Luminary'' and reprinted in the ''Rochester Daily Democrat'' on June 1, 1842.<ref>\"Died at Rochester, NY on the 18th of May, After a Few Days\u2019 Illness, Mr. James Bowman (Portrait Painter) of this Place Aged about Fifty Years.\" Mercer (PA) ''Luminary'' in the ''Rochester Daily Democrat'', June 1, 1842, 3, 1.</ref> Cornelius Krieghoff must have held Bowman in high esteem as on June 8, 1843 he announced in the ''Rochester Daily Democrat'' a five-day exhibition of paintings to raise money for a tombstone for his friend.<ref>\"Exhibition of Paintings,\" ''Rochester Daily Democrat'', June 8, 1843, 3.</ref>\n\n==Portraits painted==\n*[[William \"Tiger\" Dunlop]]\n*[[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]]\n*[[John Frothingham]]\n\n==Paintings==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:C\u00e9line and Rosalvina Pelletier.jpg|''C\u00e9line and Rosalvina Pelletier''. ca. 1838.

In 1900, the United States was producing 37% of the world's steel, but With post war industrial development in Asia and centralised investment by China, by 2017 [[List_of_countries_by_steel_production|China alone  accounted for 50%]], with Europe (including the former Soviet Union) down to 24% and North America down to 6%.\n\nFor details of country-wise steel production see [[Steel production by country]].\n\n==Growth potential of the industry==\n\nAmongst the other newly steel-producing countries, [[List_of_countries_by_steel_production|South Korea produces in 2017 71 million tonnes]], nearly double Germany; and Brazil 34 million tonnes;  all three countries little changed since 2011. \nIndian production in 2017 production is just over 100 million tonnes; up substantially from 70 in 2011 - compared to only 1 million tonnes at the time of its independence in 1947. By 1991, when the economy was opened up steel production grew to around 14 million tonnes. Thereafter, it doubled in the next 10 years, and then it is doubling again, maybe over a slightly longer span.\n\nThe world steel industry flattened from 2007\u20132009 at 1,300 million tonnes, before rising again, due to worldwide  recession starting in 2008, with its heavy cutbacks in construction, sharply lowered demand and prices falling 40%.\nShowing the impact of that plateau - in 2007 ThyssenKrupp spent $12 billion to build the two most modern mills in the world, in Alabama and Brazil. They  lost $11 billion on the new plants, which sold steel below the cost of production. Finally in 2013, [[ThyssenKrupp#Mergers_and_acquisitions|the plants were sold at under $4 billion.]]\n\n==Reduction in workforce==\nA modern steel plant employs very few people per tonne, compared to the past. In South Korea, Posco employs 29,648 people to produce 28 million tonnes. \n\nDuring the period 1974 to 1999, the steel industry had drastically reduced employment all around the world. In USA, it was down from 521,000 to 153,000. In Japan, from 459,000 to 208,000;  Germany from 232,000 to 78,000;  UK from 197,000 to 31,000; Brazil from 118,000 to 59,000; South Africa from 100,000 to 54,000. South Korea already had a low figure. It was only 58,000 in 1999. The steel industry had reduced its employment around the world by more than 1,500,000 in 25 years.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American Iron and Steel Institute]]\n* [[British Steel Corporation]]\n* [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]], in [[Canada]]\n* [[European Coal and Steel Community]]\n* [[Iron and steel industry in India]]\n* [[Iron and steel industry in the United States]]\n* [[Steel production by country]]\n* [[Steel industry in China]]\n* [[Steelmaking]]\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070423155533/http://www.worldsteel.org/pictures/newsfiles/WSIF06.pdf International Iron and Steel Institute 2006 report]\n*Development, O. f.-o.

Thereafter, it doubled in the next 10 years, and then it is doubling again, maybe over a slightly longer span.\n\nThe world steel industry flattened from 2007-2009 at 1,300 million tonnes, before rising again, due to worldwide  recession starting in 2008, with its heavy cutbacks in construction, sharply lowered demand and prices falling 40%.\nShowing the impact of that plateau - in 2007 ThyssenKrupp spent $12 billion to build the two most modern mills in the world, in Alabama and Brazil. They  lost $11 billion on the new plants, which sold steel below the cost of production. Finally in 2013, [[ThyssenKrupp#Mergers_and_acquisitions|the plants were sold at under $4 billion.]]\n\n==Reduction in workforce==\nA modern steel plant employs very few people per tonne, compared to the past. In South Korea, Posco employs 29,648 people to produce 28 million tonnes. \n\nDuring the period 1974 to 1999, the steel industry had drastically reduced employment all around the world. In USA, it was down from 521,000 to 153,000. In Japan, from 459,000 to 208,000;  Germany from 232,000 to 78,000;  UK from 197,000 to 31,000; Brazil from 118,000 to 59,000; South Africa from 100,000 to 54,000. South Korea already had a low figure. It was only 58,000 in 1999. The steel industry had reduced its employment around the world by more than 1,500,000 in 25 years.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American Iron and Steel Institute]]\n* [[British Steel Corporation]]\n* [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]], in [[Canada]]\n* [[European Coal and Steel Community]]\n* [[Iron and steel industry in India]]\n* [[Iron and steel industry in the United States]]\n* [[Steel production by country]]\n* [[Steel industry in China]]\n* [[Steelmaking]]\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070423155533/http://www.worldsteel.org/pictures/newsfiles/WSIF06.pdf International Iron and Steel Institute 2006 report]\n*Development, O. f.-o.

In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called \u201cThe Miner\u2019s Friend.\u201d It employed both vacuum and pressure.  These were used for low horsepower service for a number of years.<ref name=\"Johnson_2008\"/>\n\n[[Thomas Newcomen]] was a merchant who dealt in cast iron goods.  Newcomen's engine was based on the piston and cylinder design proposed by Papin.  In Newcomen's engine steam was condensed by water sprayed inside the cylinder, causing atmospheric pressure to move the piston.  Newcomen's first engine installed for pumping in a mine in 1712 at Dudley Castle in Staffordshire.<ref name=\"Johnson_2008\"/>\n\n===Cylinders===\n\n[[File:Papinengine.jpg|100px|thumb|right|[[Denis Papin]]'s design for a piston-and-cylinder engine, 1680.]]\n[[Denis Papin]] (22 August 1647 \u2013 c. 1712) was a French physicist, mathematician and inventor, best known for his pioneering invention of the [[steam digester]], the forerunner of the pressure cooker. In the mid-1670s Papin collaborated with the Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]] on an engine which drove out the air from a cylinder by exploding [[gunpowder]] inside it. Realising the incompleteness of the vacuum produced by this means and on moving to England in 1680, Papin devised a version of the same cylinder that obtained a more complete vacuum from boiling water and then allowing the steam to condense; in this way he was able to raise weights by attaching the end of the piston to a rope passing over a pulley. As a demonstration model the system worked, but in order to repeat the process the whole apparatus had to be dismantled and reassembled. Papin quickly saw that to make an automatic cycle the steam would have to be generated separately in a boiler; however, he did not take the project further. Papin also designed a paddle boat driven by a jet playing on a mill-wheel in a combination of Taqi al Din and Savery's conceptions and he is also credited with a number of significant devices such as the [[safety valve]]. Papin's years of research into the problems of harnessing steam was to play a key part in the development of the first successful industrial engines that soon followed his death.\n\n===Savery steam pump===\n\n{{Main|Thomas Savery}}\nThe first steam engine to be applied industrially was the \"fire-engine\" or \"Miner's Friend\", designed by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. This was a pistonless steam pump, similar to the one developed by Worcester. Savery made two key contributions that greatly improved the practicality of the design. First, in order to allow the water supply to be placed below the engine, he used condensed steam to produce a partial vacuum in the pumping reservoir  (the barrel in Worcester's example), and using that to pull the water upward. Secondly, in order to rapidly cool the steam to produce the vacuum, he ran cold water over the reservoir.\n\nOperation required several valves; when the reservoir was empty at the start of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet.<ref name=\"Tredgold, pg. 6\">Tredgold, pg. 6</ref> This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.<ref name=\"Tredgold, pg. 6\"/>\n\nSavery's engine solved a problem that had only recently become a serious one; raising water out of the mines in southern England as they reached greater depths.  Savery's engine was somewhat less efficient than Newcomen's, but this was compensated for by the fact that the separate pump used by the Newcomen engine was inefficient, giving the two engines roughly the same efficiency of 6 million foot pounds per bushel of coal (less than 1%).<ref name=\"Landes\">\n{{cite book\n|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present\n |last=Landes\t\n |first= David.

This took the shape of a reciprocating beam engine installed at surface level driving a succession of pumps at one end of the beam. The engine, attached by chains from other end of the beam, worked on the atmospheric, or vacuum principle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6r29q3kz/?order=1&brand=oac |title=Paxton Engineering Division Report (2 of 3) |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n\nNewcomen's design used some elements of earlier concepts. Like the Savery design, Newcomen's engine used steam, cooled with water, to create a vacuum. Unlike Savery's pump, however, Newcomen used the vacuum to pull on a piston instead of pulling on water directly. The upper end of the cylinder was open to the atmospheric pressure, and when the vacuum formed, the atmospheric pressure above the piston pushed it down into the cylinder. The piston was lubricated and sealed by a trickle of water from the same cistern that supplied the cooling water. Further, to improve the cooling effect, he sprayed water directly into the cylinder. \n[[File:Newcomen atmospheric engine animation.gif|right|Animation of a Newcomen atmospheric engine in action]]\n\nThe piston was attached by a chain to a large pivoted beam. When the piston pulled the beam, the other side of the beam was pulled upward. This end was attached to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.\n\nUsing the piston and beam allowed the Newcomen engine to power pumps at different levels throughout the mine, as well as eliminating the need for any high-pressure steam. The entire system was isolated to a single building on the surface. Although inefficient and extremely heavy on coal (compared to later engines), these engines raised far greater volumes of water and from greater depths than had previously been possible.<ref name=\"Rolt-Allen\">L. T. C. Rolt and J. S. Allen, ''The Steam Engine of Thomas Newcomen'' (Landmark Publishing, Ashbourne 1997).</ref> Over 100 Newcomen engines were installed around England by 1735, and it is estimated that as many as 2,000 were in operation by 1800 (including Watt versions).\n\n[[John Smeaton]] made numerous improvements to the Newcomen engine, notably the seals, and by improving these was able to almost triple their efficiency. He also preferred to use wheels instead of beams for transferring power from the cylinder, which made his engines more compact. Smeaton was the first to develop a rigorous theory of steam engine design of operation. He worked backward from the intended role to calculate the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] that would be needed for the task, the size and speed of a cylinder that would provide it, the size of boiler needed to feed it, and the amount of fuel it would consume. These were developed empirically after studying dozens of Newcomen engines in Cornwall and Newcastle, and building an experimental engine of his own at his home in [[Austhorpe]] in 1770. By the time the Watt engine was introduced only a few years later, Smeaton had built dozens of ever-larger engines into the 100&nbsp;hp range.<ref>Tredgold, pg. 21-24</ref>\n\n===Watt's separate condenser===\n[[File:Watt steam pumping engine.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Early Watt pumping engine.]]\n\nWhile working at the [[University of Glasgow]] as an instrument maker and repairman in 1759, [[James Watt]] was introduced to the power of steam by Professor [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]]. Fascinated, Watt took to reading everything he could on the subject, and independently developed the concept of [[latent heat]], only recently published by [[Joseph Black]] at the same university. When Watt learned that the University owned a small working model of a Newcomen engine, he pressed to have it returned from [[London]] where it was being unsuccessfully repaired. Watt repaired the machine, but found it was barely functional even when fully repaired.\n\nAfter working with the design, Watt concluded that 80% of the steam used by the engine was wasted. Instead of providing motive force, it was instead being used to heat the cylinder. In the Newcomen design, every power stroke was started with a spray of cold water, which not only condensed the steam, but also cooled the walls of the cylinder. This heat had to be replaced before the cylinder would accept steam again. In the Newcomen engine the heat was supplied only by the steam, so when the steam valve was opened again the vast majority condensed on the cold walls as soon as it was admitted to the cylinder. It took a considerable amount of time and steam before the cylinder warmed back up and the steam started to fill it up.\n\nWatt solved the problem of the water spray by removing the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the power cylinder. Once the induction stroke was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and  so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the power cylinder remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765.\n\nConvinced that this was a great advance, Watt entered into partnerships to provide [[venture capital]] while he worked on the design. Not content with this single improvement, Watt worked tirelessly on a series of other improvements to practically every part of the engine.  Watt further improved the system by adding a small vacuum pump to pull the steam out of the cylinder into the condenser, further improving cycle times. A more radical change from the Newcomen design was closing off the top of the cylinder and introducing low-pressure steam above the piston. Now the power was not due to the difference of atmospheric pressure and the vacuum, but the pressure of the steam and the vacuum, a somewhat higher value. On the upward return stroke, the steam on top was transferred through a pipe to the underside of the piston ready to be condensed for the downward stroke. Sealing of the piston on a [[Newcomen engine]] had been achieved by maintaining a small quantity of water on its upper side. This was no longer possible in Watt's engine due to the presence of the steam. Watt spent considerable effort to find a seal that worked, eventually obtained by using a mixture of tallow and oil. The piston rod also passed through a [[Gland (engineering)|gland]] on the top cylinder cover sealed in a similar way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page19.asp |title=Energy Hall &#124; See 'Old Bess' at work |publisher=Science Museum |accessdate=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205184700/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page19.asp |archive-date=2012-02-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe piston sealing problem was due to having no way to produce a sufficiently round cylinder.  Watt tried having cylinders bored from cast iron, but they were too out of round.  Watt was forced to use a hammered iron cylinder.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/> The following quotation is from Roe (1916):\n\n<blockquote>\"When [John] [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]] first saw the engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that 'neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision' \"<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/></blockquote>\n\nWatt finally considered the design good enough to release in 1774, and the [[Watt engine]] was released to the market. As portions of the design could be easily fitted to existing Newcomen engines, there was no need to build an entirely new engine at the mines. Instead, Watt and his business partner [[Matthew Boulton]] licensed the improvements to engine operators, charging them a portion of the money they would save in reduced fuel costs. The design was wildly successful, and the [[Boulton and Watt]] company was formed to license the design and help new manufacturers build the engines. The two would later open the [[Soho Foundry]] to produce engines of their own.\n\nIn 1774 [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a boring machine with the shaft holding the boring tool supported on both ends, extending through the cylinder, unlike the then used cantilevered borers.  With this machine he was able to successfully bore the cylinder for [[Boulton and Watt]]'s first commercial engine in 1776.<ref name=\"Roe1916\">{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, automatic valves, double-acting pistons, a variety of rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements.  Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.<ref>Ogg, David.

Oxford University Press.</ref> however James Watt was not a member of the Lunar Society at this period and his many accounts explaining the succession of thought processes leading to the final design would tend to belie this story.\n\nPower was still limited by the low pressure, the displacement of the cylinder, combustion and evaporation rates and condenser capacity. Maximum theoretical efficiency was limited by the relatively low temperature differential on either side of the piston; this meant that for a Watt engine to provide a usable amount of power, the first production engines had to be very large, and were thus expensive to build and install.\n\n===Watt double-acting and rotative engines===\n{{details|Rotative beam engine}}\n\nWatt developed a double-acting engine in which steam drove the piston in both directions, thereby increasing the engine speed and efficiency.  The double-acting principle also significantly increased the output of a given physical sized engine.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Ayres\n | first1 = Robert\n | author1-link = Robert Ayres (scientist)\n | title =Technological Transformations and Long Waves\n | year = 1989\n|page=13\n | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf\n }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention\n |last1=Rosen\n |first1= William\n|authorlink= \n|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press\n|location= \n|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=185\n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Boulton & Watt]] developed the reciprocating engine into the [[rotative beam engine|rotative type]].

He mistrusted the boiler technology of the day, the way they were constructed and the strength of the materials used.\n\nThe important advantages of high-pressure engines were: \n#They could be made much smaller than previously for a given power output. There was thus the potential for steam engines to be developed that were small and powerful enough to propel themselves and other objects. As a result, steam power for transportation now became a practicality in the form of ships and land vehicles, which revolutionised cargo businesses, travel, military strategy, and essentially every aspect of society.  \n# Because of their smaller size, they were much less expensive.  \n# They did not require the significant quantities of condenser cooling water needed by atmospheric engines.  \n# They could be designed to run at higher speeds, making them more suitable for powering machinery.\n\nThe disadvantages were: \n# In the low-pressure range they were less efficient than condensing engines, especially if steam was not used expansively.  \n# They were more susceptible to boiler explosions.\n\nThe main difference between how high-pressure and low-pressure steam engines work is the source of the force that moves the piston. In the engines of Newcomen and Watt, it is the condensation of the steam that creates most of the pressure difference, causing atmospheric pressure (Newcomen) and low-pressure steam, seldom more than 7 psi boiler pressure,<ref>https://archive.org/stream/cu31924004249532#page/n45/mode/2up p.21</ref> plus condenser vacuum<ref>\"The Steam Engine a brief history of the reciprocating engine, R.J.Law, Science Museum, Her Majesty's Stationery Office London, {{ISBN|0 11 290016 X}}, p.12</ref> (Watt), to move the piston. In a high-pressure engine, most of the pressure difference is provided by the high-pressure steam from the boiler; the low-pressure side of the piston may be at atmospheric pressure or connected to the condenser pressure. Newcomen's [[indicator diagram]], almost all below the atmospheric line, would see a revival nearly 200 years later with the low pressure cylinder of triple expansion engines contributing about 20% of the engine power, again almost completely below the atmospheric line.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Special:MemberUsers?file=images%2F6%2F69%2FEr19010125.pdf | title=Member Login - Graces Guide}}</ref>\n\nThe first known advocate of \"strong steam\" was [[Jacob Leupold]] in his scheme for an engine that appeared in encyclopaedic works from around 1725. Various projects for steam propelled boats and vehicles also appeared throughout the century one of the most promising being [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]]'s who demonstrated his \"fardier\" (steam wagon), in 1769. Whilst the working pressure used for this vehicle is unknown, the small size of the boiler gave insufficient steam production rate to allow the fardier to advance more than a few hundred metres at a time before having to stop to raise steam. Other projects and models were proposed, but as with [[William Murdoch]]'s model of 1784, many were blocked by Boulton and Watt.\n\nThis did not apply in the US, and in 1788 a steamboat built by [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] operated in regular commercial service along the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, and Burlington, New Jersey, carrying as many as 30 passengers. This boat could typically make 7 to 8 miles per hour, and traveled more than {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} during its short length of service. The Fitch steamboat was not a commercial success, as this route was adequately covered by relatively good wagon roads. In 1802 [[William Symington]] built a practical steamboat, and in 1807 [[Robert Fulton]] used a Watt steam engine to power the first commercially successful [[steamboat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Oliver Evans]] in his turn was in favour of \"strong steam\" which he applied to boat engines and to stationary uses. He was a pioneer of cylindrical boilers; however Evans' boilers did suffer several serious boiler explosions, which tended to lend weight to Watt's qualms. He founded the [[Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company]] in 1811 in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last1= Meyer\n  |first1= David R\n  |title= Networked machinists: high-technology industries in Antebellum America\n  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3rev1Icp6iwC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=%22The+Pittsburgh+Steam+Engine+Company%22&q=%22The%20Pittsburgh%20Steam%20Engine%20Company%22 |edition=\n  |series= Johns Hopkins studies in the history of technology |volume=\n  |year= 2006\n  |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press\n  |location= Baltimore\n  |isbn= 978-0-8018-8471-9\n  |oclc=65340979\n  |page= 44 |quote=\n}}</ref>\nThe company introduced high-pressure steam engines to the riverboat trade in the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi watershed]].\n\nThe first high-pressure steam engine was invented in 1800 by [[Richard Trevithick]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Trevithick_R/trevithickRichard4.asp |title = Engineering Timelines - Richard Trevithick - High pressure steam}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of raising steam under pressure (from a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] standpoint) is that it attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus became the basis for most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, \"high pressure\" amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the exhausting steam into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston.\n\nOn 21 February 1804, at the [[Penydarren]] ironworks at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in South Wales, the first self-propelled railway steam engine or steam locomotive, built by [[Richard Trevithick]], was demonstrated.<ref>Young, Robert: \"Timothy Hackworth and the Locomotive\"; the Book guild Ltd, Lewes, U.K. (2000) (reprint of 1923 ed.) pp.18-21</ref>\n\n===Cornish engine and compounding===\n{{Main|Cornish steam engine|Compound engine}}\n[[File:Cornish Figuier.JPG|thumb|left|Trevithick pumping engine (Cornish system).]]\n\nAround 1811 [[Richard Trevithick]] was required to update a Watt pumping engine in order to adapt it to one of his new large cylindrical [[Cornish boiler]]s. When Trevithick left for South America in 1816, his improvements were continued by [[William Sims (engineer)|William Sims]]. In a parallel, [[Arthur Woolf]] developed a [[compound engine]] with two cylinders, so that steam expanded in a high-pressure cylinder before being released into a low-pressure one. Efficiency was further improved by [[Samuel Groase]], who insulated the boiler, engine, and pipes.<ref name=\"Nuvolari & Verspagen, 2007\" >{{cite journal\n  |doi=10.1179/175035207X204806\n  |first=Alessandro  |last=Nuvolari  |first2=Bart  |last2=Verspagen\n  |title=''Lean's Engine Reporter'' and the Cornish Engine\n  |journal=[[Transactions of the Newcomen Society]]\n  |volume=77  |issue=2\n  |year=2007\n  |ref=Nuvolari & Verspagen, 2007\n  |pages=167\u2013190\n|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9b4a3de4241519e678b9e24e4f4b89a50c35f722 }}</ref>\n\nSteam pressure above the piston was increased eventually reaching {{convert|40|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} or even {{convert|50|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} and now provided much of the power for the downward stroke; at the same time condensing was improved. This considerably raised efficiency and further pumping engines on the Cornish system (often known as [[Cornish engine]]s) continued to be built new throughout the 19th century. Older [[Watt engine]]s were updated to conform.\n\nThe take-up of these Cornish improvements was slow in textile manufacturing areas where coal was cheap, due to the higher capital cost of the engines and the greater wear that they suffered.

He experimented with atmospheric and pressure steam engines, publishing his results in 1707.<ref name=\"Johnson_2008\"/>\n\nIn 1663 [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions which described a method for raising water between floors employing a similar principle to that of a [[coffee percolator]]. His system was the first to separate the boiler (a heated cannon barrel) from the pumping action. Water was admitted into a reinforced barrel from a cistern, and then a valve was opened to admit steam from a separate boiler.

In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called \u201cThe Miner\u2019s Friend.\u201d It employed both vacuum and pressure.  These were used for low horsepower service for a number of years.<ref name=\"Johnson_2008\"/>\n\n[[Thomas Newcomen]] was a merchant who dealt in cast iron goods.  Newcomen\u2019s engine was based on the piston and cylinder design proposed by Papin.  In Newcomen's engine steam was condensed by water sprayed inside the cylinder, causing atmospheric pressure to move the piston.  Newcomen\u2019s first engine installed for pumping in a mine in 1712 at Dudley Castle in Staffordshire.<ref name=\"Johnson_2008\"/>\n\n===Cylinders===\n\n[[File:Papinengine.jpg|100px|thumb|right|[[Denis Papin]]'s design for a piston-and-cylinder engine, 1680.]]\n[[Denis Papin]] (22 August 1647 \u2013 c. 1712) was a French physicist, mathematician and inventor, best known for his pioneering invention of the [[steam digester]], the forerunner of the pressure cooker. In the mid-1670s Papin collaborated with the Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]] on an engine which drove out the air from a cylinder by exploding [[gunpowder]] inside it. Realising the incompleteness of the vacuum produced by this means and on moving to England in 1680, Papin devised a version of the same cylinder that obtained a more complete vacuum from boiling water and then allowing the steam to condense; in this way he was able to raise weights by attaching the end of the piston to a rope passing over a pulley. As a demonstration model the system worked, but in order to repeat the process the whole apparatus had to be dismantled and reassembled. Papin quickly saw that to make an automatic cycle the steam would have to be generated separately in a boiler; however, he did not take the project further. Papin also designed a paddle boat driven by a jet playing on a mill-wheel in a combination of Taqi al Din and Savery's conceptions and he is also credited with a number of significant devices such as the [[safety valve]]. Papin's years of research into the problems of harnessing steam was to play a key part in the development of the first successful industrial engines that soon followed his death.\n\n===Savery steam pump===\n\n{{Main|Thomas Savery}}\nThe first steam engine to be applied industrially was the \"fire-engine\" or \"Miner's Friend\", designed by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. This was a pistonless steam pump, similar to the one developed by Worcester. Savery made two key contributions that greatly improved the practicality of the design. First, in order to allow the water supply to be placed below the engine, he used condensed steam to produce a partial vacuum in the pumping reservoir  (the barrel in Worcester's example), and using that to pull the water upward. Secondly, in order to rapidly cool the steam to produce the vacuum, he ran cold water over the reservoir.\n\nOperation required several valves; when the reservoir was empty at the start of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet.<ref name=\"Tredgold, pg. 6\">Tredgold, pg. 6</ref> This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.<ref name=\"Tredgold, pg. 6\"/>\n\nSavery's engine solved a problem that had only recently become a serious one; raising water out of the mines in southern England as they reached greater depths.  Savery's engine was somewhat less efficient than Newcomen's, but this was compensated for by the fact that the separate pump used by the Newcomen engine was inefficient, giving the two engines roughly the same efficiency of 6 million foot pounds per bushel of coal (less than 1%).<ref name=\"Landes\">\n{{cite book\n|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present\n |last=Landes\t\n |first= David.

This took the shape of a reciprocating beam engine installed at surface level driving a succession of pumps at one end of the beam. The engine, attached by chains from other end of the beam, worked on the atmospheric, or vacuum principle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6r29q3kz/?order=1&brand=oac |title=Paxton Engineering Division Report (2 of 3) |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n\nNewcomen's design used some elements of earlier concepts. Like the Savery design, Newcomen's engine used steam, cooled with water, to create a vacuum. Unlike Savery's pump, however, Newcomen used the vacuum to pull on a piston instead of pulling on water directly. The upper end of the cylinder was open to the atmospheric pressure, and when the vacuum formed, the atmospheric pressure above the piston pushed it down into the cylinder. The piston was lubricated and sealed by a trickle of water from the same cistern that supplied the cooling water. Further, to improve the cooling effect, he sprayed water directly into the cylinder. \n[[File:Newcomen atmospheric engine animation.gif|right|Animation of a Newcomen atmospheric engine in action]]\n\nThe piston was attached by a chain to a large pivoted beam. When the piston pulled the beam, the other side of the beam was pulled upward. This end was attached to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.\n\nUsing the piston and beam allowed the Newcomen engine to power pumps at different levels throughout the mine, as well as eliminating the need for any high-pressure steam. The entire system was isolated to a single building on the surface. Although inefficient and extremely heavy on coal (compared to later engines), these engines raised far greater volumes of water and from greater depths than had previously been possible.<ref name=\"Rolt-Allen\">L. T. C. Rolt and J. S. Allen, ''The Steam Engine of Thomas Newcomen'' (Landmark Publishing, Ashbourne 1997).</ref> Over 100 Newcomen engines were installed around England by 1735, and it is estimated that as many as 2,000 were in operation by 1800 (including Watt versions).\n\n[[John Smeaton]] made numerous improvements to the Newcomen engine, notably the seals, and by improving these was able to almost triple their efficiency. He also preferred to use wheels instead of beams for transferring power from the cylinder, which made his engines more compact. Smeaton was the first to develop a rigorous theory of steam engine design of operation. He worked backward from the intended role to calculate the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] that would be needed for the task, the size and speed of a cylinder that would provide it, the size of boiler needed to feed it, and the amount of fuel it would consume. These were developed empirically after studying dozens of Newcomen engines in Cornwall and Newcastle, and building an experimental engine of his own at his home in [[Austhorpe]] in 1770. By the time the Watt engine was introduced only a few years later, Smeaton had built dozens of ever-larger engines into the 100&nbsp;hp range.<ref>Tredgold, pg. 21-24</ref>\n\n===Watt's separate condenser===\n[[File:Watt steam pumping engine.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Early Watt pumping engine.]]\n\nWhile working at the [[University of Glasgow]] as an instrument maker and repairman in 1759, [[James Watt]] was introduced to the power of steam by Professor [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]]. Fascinated, Watt took to reading everything he could on the subject, and independently developed the concept of [[latent heat]], only recently published by [[Joseph Black]] at the same university. When Watt learned that the University owned a small working model of a Newcomen engine, he pressed to have it returned from [[London]] where it was being unsuccessfully repaired. Watt repaired the machine, but found it was barely functional even when fully repaired.\n\nAfter working with the design, Watt concluded that 80% of the steam used by the engine was wasted. Instead of providing motive force, it was instead being used to heat the cylinder. In the Newcomen design, every power stroke was started with a spray of cold water, which not only condensed the steam, but also cooled the walls of the cylinder. This heat had to be replaced before the cylinder would accept steam again. In the Newcomen engine the heat was supplied only by the steam, so when the steam valve was opened again the vast majority condensed on the cold walls as soon as it was admitted to the cylinder. It took a considerable amount of time and steam before the cylinder warmed back up and the steam started to fill it up.\n\nWatt solved the problem of the water spray by removing the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the power cylinder. Once the induction stroke was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and  so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the power cylinder remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765.\n\nConvinced that this was a great advance, Watt entered into partnerships to provide [[venture capital]] while he worked on the design. Not content with this single improvement, Watt worked tirelessly on a series of other improvements to practically every part of the engine.  Watt further improved the system by adding a small vacuum pump to pull the steam out of the cylinder into the condenser, further improving cycle times. A more radical change from the Newcomen design was closing off the top of the cylinder and introducing low-pressure steam above the piston. Now the power was not due to the difference of atmospheric pressure and the vacuum, but the pressure of the steam and the vacuum, a somewhat higher value. On the upward return stroke, the steam on top was transferred through a pipe to the underside of the piston ready to be condensed for the downward stroke. Sealing of the piston on a [[Newcomen engine]] had been achieved by maintaining a small quantity of water on its upper side. This was no longer possible in Watt's engine due to the presence of the steam. Watt spent considerable effort to find a seal that worked, eventually obtained by using a mixture of tallow and oil. The piston rod also passed through a [[Gland (engineering)|gland]] on the top cylinder cover sealed in a similar way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page19.asp |title=Energy Hall &#124; See 'Old Bess' at work |publisher=Science Museum |accessdate=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205184700/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page19.asp |archive-date=2012-02-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe piston sealing problem was due to having no way to produce a sufficiently round cylinder.  Watt tried having cylinders bored from cast iron, but they were too out of round.  Watt was forced to use a hammered iron cylinder.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/> The following quotation is from Roe (1916):\n\n<blockquote>\"When [John] [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]] first saw the engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that 'neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision' \"<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/></blockquote>\n\nWatt finally considered the design good enough to release in 1774, and the [[Watt engine]] was released to the market. As portions of the design could be easily fitted to existing Newcomen engines, there was no need to build an entirely new engine at the mines. Instead, Watt and his business partner [[Matthew Boulton]] licensed the improvements to engine operators, charging them a portion of the money they would save in reduced fuel costs. The design was wildly successful, and the [[Boulton and Watt]] company was formed to license the design and help new manufacturers build the engines. The two would later open the [[Soho Foundry]] to produce engines of their own.\n\nIn 1774 [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a boring machine with the shaft holding the boring tool supported on both ends, extending through the cylinder, unlike the then used cantilevered borers.  With this machine he was able to successfully bore the cylinder for [[Boulton and Watt]]'s first commercial engine in 1776.<ref name=\"Roe1916\">{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, automatic valves, double-acting pistons, a variety of rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements.  Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.<ref>Ogg, David.

Oxford University Press.</ref> however James Watt was not a member of the Lunar Society at this period and his many accounts explaining the succession of thought processes leading to the final design would tend to belie this story.\n\nPower was still limited by the low pressure, the displacement of the cylinder, combustion and evaporation rates and condenser capacity. Maximum theoretical efficiency was limited by the relatively low temperature differential on either side of the piston; this meant that for a Watt engine to provide a usable amount of power, the first production engines had to be very large, and were thus expensive to build and install.\n\n===Watt double-acting and rotative engines===\n{{details|Rotative beam engine}}\n\nWatt developed a double-acting engine in which steam drove the piston in both directions, thereby increasing the engine speed and efficiency.

He mistrusted the boiler technology of the day, the way they were constructed and the strength of the materials used.\n\nThe important advantages of high-pressure engines were: \n#They could be made much smaller than previously for a given power output. There was thus the potential for steam engines to be developed that were small and powerful enough to propel themselves and other objects. As a result, steam power for transportation now became a practicality in the form of ships and land vehicles, which revolutionised cargo businesses, travel, military strategy, and essentially every aspect of society.  \n# Because of their smaller size, they were much less expensive.  \n# They did not require the significant quantities of condenser cooling water needed by atmospheric engines.  \n# They could be designed to run at higher speeds, making them more suitable for powering machinery.\n\nThe disadvantages were: \n# In the low-pressure range they were less efficient than condensing engines, especially if steam was not used expansively.  \n# They were more susceptible to boiler explosions.\n\nThe main difference between how high-pressure and low-pressure steam engines work is the source of the force that moves the piston. In the engines of Newcomen and Watt, it is the condensation of the steam that creates most of the pressure difference, causing atmospheric pressure (Newcomen) and low-pressure steam, seldom more than 7 psi boiler pressure,<ref>https://archive.org/stream/cu31924004249532#page/n45/mode/2up p.21</ref> plus condenser vacuum<ref>\"The Steam Engine a brief history of the reciprocating engine, R.J.Law, Science Museum, Her Majesty's Stationery Office London, {{ISBN|0 11 290016 X}}, p.12</ref> (Watt), to move the piston. In a high-pressure engine, most of the pressure difference is provided by the high-pressure steam from the boiler; the low-pressure side of the piston may be at atmospheric pressure or connected to the condenser pressure. Newcomen's [[indicator diagram]], almost all below the atmospheric line, would see a revival nearly 200 years later with the low pressure cylinder of triple expansion engines contributing about 20% of the engine power, again almost completely below the atmospheric line.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Special:MemberUsers?file=images%2F6%2F69%2FEr19010125.pdf | title=Member Login - Graces Guide}}</ref>\n\nThe first known advocate of \"strong steam\" was [[Jacob Leupold]] in his scheme for an engine that appeared in encyclopaedic works from around 1725. Various projects for steam propelled boats and vehicles also appeared throughout the century one of the most promising being [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]]'s who demonstrated his \"fardier\" (steam wagon), in 1769. Whilst the working pressure used for this vehicle is unknown, the small size of the boiler gave insufficient steam production rate to allow the fardier to advance more than a few hundred metres at a time before having to stop to raise steam. Other projects and models were proposed, but as with [[William Murdoch]]'s model of 1784, many were blocked by Boulton and Watt.\n\nThis did not apply in the US, and in 1788 a steamboat built by [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] operated in regular commercial service along the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, and Burlington, New Jersey, carrying as many as 30 passengers. This boat could typically make 7 to 8 miles per hour, and traveled more than {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} during its short length of service. The Fitch steamboat was not a commercial success, as this route was adequately covered by relatively good wagon roads. In 1802 [[William Symington]] built a practical steamboat, and in 1807 [[Robert Fulton]] used a Watt steam engine to power the first commercially successful [[steamboat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Oliver Evans]] in his turn was in favour of \"strong steam\" which he applied to boat engines and to stationary uses. He was a pioneer of cylindrical boilers; however Evans' boilers did suffer several serious boiler explosions, which tended to lend weight to Watt's qualms. He founded the [[Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company]] in 1811 in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last1= Meyer\n  |first1= David R\n  |title= Networked machinists: high-technology industries in Antebellum America\n  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3rev1Icp6iwC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=%22The+Pittsburgh+Steam+Engine+Company%22&q=%22The%20Pittsburgh%20Steam%20Engine%20Company%22 |edition=\n  |series= Johns Hopkins studies in the history of technology |volume=\n  |year= 2006\n  |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press\n  |location= Baltimore\n  |isbn= 978-0-8018-8471-9\n  |oclc=65340979\n  |page= 44 |quote=\n}}</ref>\nThe company introduced high-pressure steam engines to the riverboat trade in the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi watershed]].\n\nThe first high-pressure steam engine was invented in 1800 by [[Richard Trevithick]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Trevithick_R/trevithickRichard4.asp |title = Engineering Timelines - Richard Trevithick - High pressure steam}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of raising steam under pressure (from a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] standpoint) is that it attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus became the basis for most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, \"high pressure\" amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the exhausting steam into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston.\n\nOn 21 February 1804, at the [[Penydarren]] ironworks at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in South Wales, the first self-propelled railway steam engine or steam locomotive, built by [[Richard Trevithick]], was demonstrated.<ref>Young, Robert: \"Timothy Hackworth and the Locomotive\"; the Book guild Ltd, Lewes, U.K. (2000) (reprint of 1923 ed.) pp.18-21</ref>\n\n===Cornish engine and compounding===\n{{Main|Cornish steam engine|Compound engine}}\n[[File:Cornish Figuier.JPG|thumb|left|Trevithick pumping engine (Cornish system).]]\n\nAround 1811 [[Richard Trevithick]] was required to update a Watt pumping engine in order to adapt it to one of his new large cylindrical [[Cornish boiler]]s. When Trevithick left for South America in 1816, his improvements were continued by [[William Sims (engineer)|William Sims]]. In a parallel, [[Arthur Woolf]] developed a [[compound engine]] with two cylinders, so that steam expanded in a high-pressure cylinder before being released into a low-pressure one. Efficiency was further improved by [[Samuel Groase]], who insulated the boiler, engine, and pipes.<ref name=\"Nuvolari & Verspagen, 2007\" >{{cite journal\n  |doi=10.1179/175035207X204806\n  |first=Alessandro  |last=Nuvolari  |first2=Bart  |last2=Verspagen\n  |title=''Lean's Engine Reporter'' and the Cornish Engine\n  |journal=[[Transactions of the Newcomen Society]]\n  |volume=77  |issue=2\n  |year=2007\n  |ref=Nuvolari & Verspagen, 2007\n  |pages=167\u2013190\n|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9b4a3de4241519e678b9e24e4f4b89a50c35f722 }}</ref>\n\nSteam pressure above the piston was increased eventually reaching {{convert|40|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} or even {{convert|50|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} and now provided much of the power for the downward stroke; at the same time condensing was improved. This considerably raised efficiency and further pumping engines on the Cornish system (often known as [[Cornish engine]]s) continued to be built new throughout the 19th century. Older [[Watt engine]]s were updated to conform.\n\nThe take-up of these Cornish improvements was slow in textile manufacturing areas where coal was cheap, due to the higher capital cost of the engines and the greater wear that they suffered.

Stone also pointed out that although Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land owners in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had harmful effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\nMost of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to Sufism and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism is the correct way to reach God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Y\u0131lmaz|first=H\u00fcseyin|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Caliphate_Redefined.html?id=KvbWDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y|title=Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought|date=2018-01-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8804-7|language=en}}</ref> Because the matters of jurisprudence and shariah were state matters, the state sponsored Sufi religious dominance came into play.

The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic [[Iran]] remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p = 38}} According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of [[Sunni|orthodox]] Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.<ref name=\"Kapucu\">{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC/page/n71 77]}}</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, or as a dynastic institution, the House of Osman, was unprecedented and unmatched in the Islamic world for its size and duration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nspmqLKPU-wC&pg=PA199|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93243-1|page=199}}</ref> In Europe, only the [[House of Habsburg]] had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because his enemies perceived him as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparalleled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had several advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

For instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

Since the closing of the ''[[ijtihad]]'', or ''Gate of Interpretation, Qadis ''throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent, and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered.<ref name=\"Benton 109-110\"/> However, the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure, leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Ottoman legal system saw substantial reform.

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan [[Selim III]].

Still, as Western Europe modernized its military organization technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or the cavalrymen might supersede them, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. <ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who was a potent military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt executed the leaders and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into the Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  A large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their language, ran their schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>, Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> Also, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the Millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>, Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the result that they came out as one of the most massive losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Seljuk Empire]], were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits, and customs, and therefore the empire has been described as a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] empire.<ref name=\"Iranica\">{{cite encyclopedia|first=O. |last=\u00d6zg\u00fcndenli |title=Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |edition=online |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005207/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Studies on Persianate Societies\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite book|first1 = F.|last1 = Walter|title = Music of the Ottoman court|chapter = The Departure of Turkey from the 'Persianate' Musical Sphere|chapter-url = Http://www.vwb-verlag.com/Katalog/m641.html}}</ref> Intercultural marriages also played a part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analog genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the most significant part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most notably the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents. In the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously. For instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century. Still, there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the most celebrated architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]], and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s, and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans, and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains, and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form. However, it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the symbolic images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs, and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science, and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.

Stone also pointed out that although Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land owners in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had harmful effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\nMost of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to Sufism and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism is the correct way to reach God.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Y\u0131lmaz|first=H\u00fcseyin|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Caliphate_Redefined.html?id=KvbWDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y|title=Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought|date=2018-01-08|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8804-7|language=en}}</ref> Because the matters of jurisprudence and shariah were state matters, the state sponsored Sufi religious dominance came into play.

The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic [[Iran]] remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p = 38}} According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of [[Sunni|orthodox]] Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.<ref name=\"Kapucu\">{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DWceNjwTggUC/page/n71 77]}}</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, or as a dynastic institution, the House of Osman, was unprecedented and unmatched in the Islamic world for its size and duration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nspmqLKPU-wC&pg=PA199|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93243-1|page=199}}</ref> In Europe, only the [[House of Habsburg]] had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because his enemies perceived him as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparalleled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had several advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

For instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

Since the closing of the ''[[ijtihad]]'', or ''Gate of Interpretation, Qadis ''throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent, and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered.<ref name=\"Benton 109-110\"/> However, the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure, leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Ottoman legal system saw substantial reform.

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan [[Selim III]].

Still, as Western Europe modernized its military organization technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or the cavalrymen might supersede them, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. <ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who was a potent military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt executed the leaders and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into the Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  A large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their language, ran their schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>, Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> Also, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the Millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>, Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the result that they came out as one of the most massive losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (In fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Seljuk Empire]], were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits, and customs, and therefore the empire has been described as a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] empire.<ref name=\"Iranica\">{{cite encyclopedia|first=O. |last=\u00d6zg\u00fcndenli |title=Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |edition=online |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005207/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Studies on Persianate Societies\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>{{cite book|first1 = F.|last1 = Walter|title = Music of the Ottoman court|chapter = The Departure of Turkey from the 'Persianate' Musical Sphere|chapter-url = Http://www.vwb-verlag.com/Katalog/m641.html}}</ref> Intercultural marriages also played a part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analog genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the most significant part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most notably the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents. In the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously. For instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century. Still, there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the most celebrated architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]], and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s, and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans, and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains, and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form. However, it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the symbolic images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs, and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science, and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.
