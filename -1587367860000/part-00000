The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson| they wrote the song for the birth of Mr. Noah Williams of the United States (a much better country) of 4.20.1999\n\nThe song was recorded in March 2000 and released in June that same year as the second single from ''Parachutes'', following \"[[Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver]]\", and the [[lead single]] in the United States. \"Yellow\" reached number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]], giving Coldplay their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom. It was Coldplay's breakthrough hit internationally, reaching number one in Iceland, number five in Australia, number nine in Ireland and number 48 in the United States. Helped by heavy rotation and usage in advertising, the song thrust the band into popularity. \"Yellow\" has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n\n==Background and inspiration==\n\"Yellow\" was written in  [[Rockfield Studios|Rockfield]]'s Quadrangle studio in south [[Wales]], where Coldplay began working on their debut album, ''[[Parachutes (Coldplay album)|Parachutes]]''.<ref name=\"Inglis\">{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/ken.htm |title=Recording Coldplay's Parachutes|last=Inglis|first=Sam|date=October 2000|work=SOS|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> One night after finishing recording \"[[Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver]]\", the band took a break and went out of the studio.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\">{{cite news|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427212/20001016/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Escapes City For \"Yellow\" Single, Video|last=Basham|first=David|date=16 October 2000|publisher=MTV|accessdate=9 September 2008}}</ref> Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/whatson/yellow.shtml|title=BRITs 25 Song Award: Yellow - Coldplay|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer [[Chris Martin]] was inspired by the sight and the song's main [[melody]], consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously and sang the tune to the rest of the band in \"his worst [[Neil Young]] impersonation voice\". Martin has said, \"The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice.\"<ref name=\"Roach39\">Roach, p. 39</ref> The melody \"started off a lot slower\", according to drummer [[Will Champion]], and it sounded like a Neil Young song.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /><ref name=\"HiattRS\" /> Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the [[tempo]] of the verse. When guitarist [[Jonny Buckland]] started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the [[riff]], \"and it sort of got a bit heavier\".<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" />\n\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing keyword in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time.<ref name=\"Roach39\" /><ref name=\"HiattRS\">{{cite magazine|title=Coldplay Revive TV Show|date=1 June 2005|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=18 December 2006|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/prince/articles/story/7371897/coldplay_revive_tv_show }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62894/coldplay-tells-stories-at-intimate-new-york-gig |title=Coldplay Tells Stories At Intimate New York Gig|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=17 May 2005|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to Stephanie's \"yellow glow\". The lyrics progressed from there, with the band collaborating. Bassist [[Guy Berryman]] came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\n\nA much different origin of the song was told on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang \"look at the stars\". Martin went on to further explain that the word \"yellow\" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change \"yellow\" to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word \"yellow\" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying \"I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5efsGs3niy0 Howard Stern show 11 September 2011]</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nThe band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was acquainted with the band's music through the former's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an [[The Blue Room (EP)|EP]] and [[Brothers & Sisters (song)|single]] by Coldplay, and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live. \"Yellow\" was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio, basically a [[demo (music)|demo]] room in [[Liverpool]]'s Parr Street Studios.<ref name=\"Inglis\" /><ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /> The track was later [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in [[New York City]].\n\nNelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song. According to Champion, \"...&nbsp;it was really difficult to record because it worked at about five or six different [[tempo]]s. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging...\"<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /> The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, \"because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same [[groove (music)|groove]]\". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.<ref name=\"Inglis\" />\n\nNelson used an analogue 2-inch type tape in recording most of the tracks on the album. As the recording progressed, \"Yellow\" was one of a couple of songs that they \"couldn't quite get on analogue\". They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used [[Pro Tools]] \"to get the feel of [the track] just right\"; once all takes were recorded into the computer, \"we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it\", according to Nelson.<ref name=\"Inglis\" />\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen|filename=Coldplay - Yellow.ogg|title=Yellow|description=Sample of \"Yellow\" from Coldplay's 2000 album ''[[Parachutes (album)|Parachutes]]''.}}\n\nMartin has explained, \"'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and devotion.\" The references in some of the lyrics, including swimming and drawing a line, \"are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion\".<ref name=\"Roach40\">Roach, p. 40</ref> The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists, and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion, referring to his unrequited love for someone or something. Despite its lyrical theme, many fans have considered \"Yellow\" to be an upbeat track, although it is often interpreted as melancholy as well.<ref name=\"Roach41\">Roach, p. 41</ref> The song is written in the key of [[B major]] with a tempo of 88 beats per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0043564|publisher=BMG Music Publishing|accessdate=10 September 2015|title=Yellow sheet music}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:YellowLive.JPG|thumb|left|Coldplay performing \"Yellow\" in 2005]]\n\"Yellow\" and \"Shiver\" were initially released as [[Extended play|EP]]s in the spring of 2000<ref name=\"AMGRock\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|author2=Woodstra, Chris |author3=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |title=AllMusic Guide to Rock}}</ref> along with the songs \"Help Is Round the Corner\" and \"No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground\", the third taken from the band's first EP, ''[[Safety (EP)|Safety]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=coldplay|chart=all}} |title=Yellow |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=9 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405000723/http://www.billboard.com:80/artist/299516/coldplay/chart? |archivedate=5 April 2013  }}</ref> In the United States, the song was released as the [[lead single]] from the album.

It re-entered the chart at number 48.\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:Studlandbeach.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at [[Studland|Studland Bay]]]]\nThe music video for \"Yellow\" was filmed at [[Studland|Studland Bay]] in the county of Dorset, [[South West England]]. The video is minimalistic, featuring only Martin singing the song as he walks along the beach. He is seen wearing a set of waterproofs with his hair wet, suggesting that it had just rained. The video is one continuous shot with no cuts. The entire sequence is in slow motion.\n\nOriginally, it had been intended for the whole band to appear in the video. Champion's mother's funeral was held on the day of the shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part.<ref name=\"Roach41\" /> The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, as if in a time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /> The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.\n\nThe video was directed by British directing duo [[James Frost (video director)|James Frost]] & Alex Smith of The Artists Company.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\"/> It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow-motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the [[telecine]] process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted from a monochromatic, grainy look at the start, to a warm, colourful and bright look at the end of the video. The look was inspired by the night swimming scenes in the movie Jaws.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Coldplay Yellow.jpg|thumb|right|Coldplay performing \"Yellow\" in 2006 during the Twisted Logic tour, with yellow balloons falling]]\n\nColdplay have performed the song throughout their career, and it is a firm audience favourite. The song had its debut performance on television on the show ''Later...with Jools Holland''. They performed ''Parachutes'''s lead single, \"Shiver\", and the new song, \"Yellow\"; but it was the latter that had an immediate studio audience impact.<ref name=\"Roach35\">Roach, p. 35</ref> They have also performed it at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], one of the prominent festivals in Europe. During their second appearance in July 2000, Coldplay performed \"Yellow\" and \"effortlessly\" captured over 10,000 spectators.<ref name=\"Roach35\" /> Coldplay's popularity at this time was still growing and \"Yellow\" has helped cultivate it; Martin has said it was the best day of their year.<ref>Roach, p. 36</ref> During most concert performances, large yellow [[balloons]] are dropped on the audience. The first known sighting of yellow balloons was on 24 September 2002 at the [[UIC Pavilion]] in [[Chicago]]. Chris Martin noticed the balloons in the air with a surprised look. In more recent years, (January 2013) the balloons are filled with confetti, and at the end of the song Chris Martin would pop one with his guitar causing confetti to fly everywhere.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrK7rNotFgQ</ref>\n\nA live acoustic version performed on [[Jo Whiley]]'s ''The Lunchtime Social'' was included on the ''Acoustic'' EP. Another live version featuring only piano and vocals performed and broadcast in Los Angeles on [[KCRW]]'s [[Morning Becomes Eclectic]] was included on the ''Japanese Clocks'' EP. Most recently an acoustic piano version the song was recorded in the studio for [[Starbucks]] charity compilation album ''Every Mother Counts 2012''.\n\nColdplay performed the song at the Celebrating Steve event at the [[Apple (company)|Apple]] campus on 16 October 2011. Before the performance, Martin revealed that, when they first played it for [[Steve Jobs]] 10 years ago, Jobs said the song was \"shit\" and that \"they would never make it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html|title=Celebrating Steve|work=Apple|accessdate=2 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229060335/http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html|archivedate=29 December 2013}}</ref> The song was later performed on 7 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany with guest vocals from Shakira.\n\n==Notable cover versions==\n\"Yellow\" has been covered by many musicians, some in different languages and styles. Among the most notable is a Chinese language cover used as the last song in the 2018 movie, ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] and Coldplay were initially both opposed to using the song, but director [[Jon M. Chu]] convinced them otherwise, adding that \"a white director couldn't do it,\" but he could. Coldplay was convinced after Chu wrote a moving letter to the band.<ref>{{Cite

The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]] for their debut album, ''[[Parachutes (Coldplay album)|Parachutes]]'' (2000).\n\nThe song was recorded in March 2000 and released in June that same year as the second single from ''Parachutes'', following \"[[Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver]]\", and the [[lead single]] in the United States. \"Yellow\" reached number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]], giving Coldplay their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom. It was Coldplay's breakthrough hit internationally, reaching number one in Iceland, number five in Australia, number nine in Ireland and number 48 in the United States. Helped by heavy rotation and usage in advertising, the song thrust the band into popularity. \"Yellow\" has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n\n==Background and inspiration==\n\"Yellow\" was written in  [[Rockfield Studios|Rockfield]]'s Quadrangle studio in south [[Wales]], where Coldplay began working on their debut album, ''[[Parachutes (Coldplay album)|Parachutes]]''.<ref name=\"Inglis\">{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/ken.htm |title=Recording Coldplay's Parachutes|last=Inglis|first=Sam|date=October 2000|work=SOS|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> One night after finishing recording \"[[Shiver (Coldplay song)|Shiver]]\", the band took a break and went out of the studio.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\">{{cite news|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427212/20001016/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay Escapes City For \"Yellow\" Single, Video|last=Basham|first=David|date=16 October 2000|publisher=MTV|accessdate=9 September 2008}}</ref> Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/whatson/yellow.shtml|title=BRITs 25 Song Award: Yellow - Coldplay|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer [[Chris Martin]] was inspired by the sight and the song's main [[melody]], consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously and sang the tune to the rest of the band in \"his worst [[Neil Young]] impersonation voice\". Martin has said, \"The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice.\"<ref name=\"Roach39\">Roach, p. 39</ref> The melody \"started off a lot slower\", according to drummer [[Will Champion]], and it sounded like a Neil Young song.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /><ref name=\"HiattRS\" /> Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the [[tempo]] of the verse. When guitarist [[Jonny Buckland]] started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the [[riff]], \"and it sort of got a bit heavier\".<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" />\n\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing keyword in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time.<ref name=\"Roach39\" /><ref name=\"HiattRS\">{{cite magazine|title=Coldplay Revive TV Show|date=1 June 2005|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=18 December 2006|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/prince/articles/story/7371897/coldplay_revive_tv_show }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62894/coldplay-tells-stories-at-intimate-new-york-gig |title=Coldplay Tells Stories At Intimate New York Gig|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=17 May 2005|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to Stephanie's \"yellow glow\". The lyrics progressed from there, with the band collaborating. Bassist [[Guy Berryman]] came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\n\nA much different origin of the song was told on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang \"look at the stars\". Martin went on to further explain that the word \"yellow\" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change \"yellow\" to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word \"yellow\" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying \"I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5efsGs3niy0 Howard Stern show 11 September 2011]</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nThe band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was acquainted with the band's music through the former's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an [[The Blue Room (EP)|EP]] and [[Brothers & Sisters (song)|single]] by Coldplay, and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live. \"Yellow\" was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio, basically a [[demo (music)|demo]] room in [[Liverpool]]'s Parr Street Studios.<ref name=\"Inglis\" /><ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /> The track was later [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in [[New York City]].\n\nNelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song. According to Champion, \"...&nbsp;it was really difficult to record because it worked at about five or six different [[tempo]]s. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging...\"<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /> The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, \"because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same [[groove (music)|groove]]\". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.<ref name=\"Inglis\" />\n\nNelson used an analogue 2-inch type tape in recording most of the tracks on the album. As the recording progressed, \"Yellow\" was one of a couple of songs that they \"couldn't quite get on analogue\". They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used [[Pro Tools]] \"to get the feel of [the track] just right\"; once all takes were recorded into the computer, \"we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it\", according to Nelson.<ref name=\"Inglis\" />\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen|filename=Coldplay - Yellow.ogg|title=Yellow|description=Sample of \"Yellow\" from Coldplay's 2000 album ''[[Parachutes (album)|Parachutes]]''.}}\n\nMartin has explained, \"'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and devotion.\" The references in some of the lyrics, including swimming and drawing a line, \"are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion\".<ref name=\"Roach40\">Roach, p. 40</ref> The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists, and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion, referring to his unrequited love for someone or something. Despite its lyrical theme, many fans have considered \"Yellow\" to be an upbeat track, although it is often interpreted as melancholy as well.<ref name=\"Roach41\">Roach, p. 41</ref> The song is written in the key of [[B major]] with a tempo of 88 beats per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0043564|publisher=BMG Music Publishing|accessdate=10 September 2015|title=Yellow sheet music}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:YellowLive.JPG|thumb|left|Coldplay performing \"Yellow\" in 2005]]\n\"Yellow\" and \"Shiver\" were initially released as [[Extended play|EP]]s in the spring of 2000<ref name=\"AMGRock\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|author2=Woodstra, Chris |author3=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |title=AllMusic Guide to Rock}}</ref> along with the songs \"Help Is Round the Corner\" and \"No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground\", the third taken from the band's first EP, ''[[Safety (EP)|Safety]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=coldplay|chart=all}} |title=Yellow |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=9 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405000723/http://www.billboard.com:80/artist/299516/coldplay/chart? |archivedate=5 April 2013  }}</ref> In the United States, the song was released as the [[lead single]] from the album.

It re-entered the chart at number 48.\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:Studlandbeach.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at [[Studland|Studland Bay]]]]\nThe music video for \"Yellow\" was filmed at [[Studland|Studland Bay]] in the county of Dorset, [[South West England]]. The video is minimalistic, featuring only Martin singing the song as he walks along the beach. He is seen wearing a set of waterproofs with his hair wet, suggesting that it had just rained. The video is one continuous shot with no cuts. The entire sequence is in slow motion.\n\nOriginally, it had been intended for the whole band to appear in the video. Champion's mother's funeral was held on the day of the shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part.<ref name=\"Roach41\" /> The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, as if in a time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\" /> The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.\n\nThe video was directed by British directing duo [[James Frost (video director)|James Frost]] & Alex Smith of The Artists Company.<ref name=\"BashamEscape\"/> It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow-motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the [[telecine]] process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted from a monochromatic, grainy look at the start, to a warm, colourful and bright look at the end of the video. The look was inspired by the night swimming scenes in the movie Jaws.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Coldplay Yellow.jpg|thumb|right|Coldplay performing \"Yellow\" in 2006 during the Twisted Logic tour, with yellow balloons falling]]\n\nColdplay have performed the song throughout their career, and it is a firm audience favourite. The song had its debut performance on television on the show ''Later...with Jools Holland''. They performed ''Parachutes'''s lead single, \"Shiver\", and the new song, \"Yellow\"; but it was the latter that had an immediate studio audience impact.<ref name=\"Roach35\">Roach, p. 35</ref> They have also performed it at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], one of the prominent festivals in Europe. During their second appearance in July 2000, Coldplay performed \"Yellow\" and \"effortlessly\" captured over 10,000 spectators.<ref name=\"Roach35\" /> Coldplay's popularity at this time was still growing and \"Yellow\" has helped cultivate it; Martin has said it was the best day of their year.<ref>Roach, p. 36</ref> During most concert performances, large yellow [[balloons]] are dropped on the audience. The first known sighting of yellow balloons was on 24 September 2002 at the [[UIC Pavilion]] in [[Chicago]]. Chris Martin noticed the balloons in the air with a surprised look. In more recent years, (January 2013) the balloons are filled with confetti, and at the end of the song Chris Martin would pop one with his guitar causing confetti to fly everywhere.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrK7rNotFgQ</ref>\n\nA live acoustic version performed on [[Jo Whiley]]'s ''The Lunchtime Social'' was included on the ''Acoustic'' EP. Another live version featuring only piano and vocals performed and broadcast in Los Angeles on [[KCRW]]'s [[Morning Becomes Eclectic]] was included on the ''Japanese Clocks'' EP. Most recently an acoustic piano version the song was recorded in the studio for [[Starbucks]] charity compilation album ''Every Mother Counts 2012''.\n\nColdplay performed the song at the Celebrating Steve event at the [[Apple (company)|Apple]] campus on 16 October 2011. Before the performance, Martin revealed that, when they first played it for [[Steve Jobs]] 10 years ago, Jobs said the song was \"shit\" and that \"they would never make it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html|title=Celebrating Steve|work=Apple|accessdate=2 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229060335/http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/10oiuhfvojb23/event/index.html|archivedate=29 December 2013}}</ref> The song was later performed on 7 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany with guest vocals from Shakira.\n\n==Notable cover versions==\n\"Yellow\" has been covered by many musicians, some in different languages and styles. Among the most notable is a Chinese language cover used as the last song in the 2018 movie, ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] and Coldplay were initially both opposed to using the song, but director [[Jon M. Chu]] convinced them otherwise, adding that \"a white director couldn't do it,\" but he could. Coldplay was convinced after Chu wrote a moving letter to the band.<ref>{{Cite

Martin Roach claimed in his book, ''Coldplay: Nobody Said It Was Easy'', that although \"Shiver\" earned the band their debut UK Top 40 single, it was \"Yellow\" that has changed \"everything\", and that it \"exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular\".<ref name=\"Roach39\" /> In the US, after it was being used in promos of ABC, the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001.<ref name=\"AMGRock\" /> According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay's second album, ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine, the band is still known

In these sections, Briggs would discuss the films, and more, from the inside and outside of a staged trailer home with a green neon TNT sign in the background. Briggs was also frequently visited by one of a succession of 'mail girls', including Honey (Honey Michelle Gregory), Reno, Summer (Kathy Shower), and Rusty (Renner St. John), who not only served as attractive, comedic 'sidekicks,' but also brought Briggs fan letters, sometimes from actual prisoners. TNT also added the segment ''Joe Bob's Last Call'', which was used to showcase the final movie of the night.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910125805/http://www.mondo-video.com/joe-bob-briggs-interview|title=Joe Bob Briggs {{!}} Mondo Film & Video Guide|date=2011-09-10|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531052430/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fP8fKRQ68osJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/111768116/+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=The Courier-Journal from Louisville, Kentucky on January 17, 1997 \u00b7 Page 30|date=2018-05-31|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref> Similarly, the program was occasionally able to feature guests such as rapper and actor [[Ice-T]], and directors [[Wes Craven]] and [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-04/news/9807040131_1_joe-bob-briggs-monstervision-movies|title=\"MonsterVision\": Television isn't just for entertainment... - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Josh Hadley|title=Joe Bob Briggs Monstervision - Hairspray (with John Waters)|date=2017-06-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUjNRKpzwc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> \nWhen it came to the movies, ''MonsterVision'', under Briggs, would sometimes stray away from the typical horror and science fiction films, showing [[Western (genre)|westerns]], [[blaxploitation]], [[kung-fu]], dramas, comedies and other film genres, specifically in the later years. Additionally, as a way to connect fans further to the movies being presented during episodes, ''MonsterVision'' was known for its early use of the internet at [https://web.archive.org/web/19990209012302/http://www.tnt.turner.com/monstervision/ tnt.turner.com/monstervision].

He frequently played on the term \"[[kung fu]]\" to describe action sequences with a particular theme, such as 'Quicksand Fu' in ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''. Briggs' introduction to ''[[Phantasm II]]'', for example, comprised: {{quote|\"Twelve dead bodies. Exploding house. One four-barreled sawed-off shotgun. Dwarf tossing. Ten breasts.

These could be more serious discussions, for example, of trivia about obscure film actors, or controversies such as the race debates around films such as ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. Conversely, Briggs' pieces could be more lighthearted, with deliberately outrageous political statements and occasional banter with his film crew. He frequently described his notional day-to-day activities, including supposed problems with his girlfriends (or lack thereof) and his four ex-wives (usually the fourth, \"Wanda Bodeine\"). Lastly, Briggs usually signed off each episode of ''MonsterVision'' with a casual debriefing on the movie just-ended, along with a series of deliberately bad jokes, and a reminder that \"the Drive-In will never die!\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFurthermore, during these sections, Briggs routinely criticized and lampooned TNT's censorship of the films, with frequent reference to the channel's owner, [[Ted Turner]]. This [[running gag]] culminated with a Halloween marathon of ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' movies, which portrayed strange occurrences throughout the night, leading to Joe Bob realizing that Turner was trying to 'kill' him. The final scene saw Joe Bob give an impassioned apology to Turner, claiming he was an amazing person, before the video feed cut off eerily.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs \"Friday the 13th\" Marathon (complete) on \"Monstervision\"|date=2014-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRUymBAlfk|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> A similar stunt was staged in ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''-themed scenes for a later horror marathon, with the host mysteriously missing.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs -\"Nair Witch Project\"- Carrie - Child's Play 2 - Phantasm 1 & 2|date=2014-10-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoD3EmCY7sc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on June 7, 1997,<ref>''New York Times'', ProQuest, Television Listing - June 7/8, 1997</ref> the series moved to Saturday nights in order to avoid further conflicts with TNT sports broadcasts.

Moving from Dallas to Los Angeles, not only was the general aesthetic of the show changed to feel more 'Hollywood', but the first film of each episode going forward tended to be more 'mainstream', while the second was usually in accordance with traditional ''MonsterVision''. Subsequently, this meant that the ''Joe Bob\u2019s Last Call'' segment would be dropped altogether. Although the original formula of the program was now changed, this transition allowed for more guests, such as [[Rhonda Shear]],<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs w/Rhonda Shear presents \"in the Mouth of Madness\" w/Count Floyd|date=2014-10-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1rDzM_Hes|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> and horror movie specials still remained a staple of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206034829/http://caseycorpier.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-drive-in-will-never-die-story-of.html|title=The Video Creep with Casey C.

In these sections, Briggs would discuss the films, and more, from the inside and outside of a staged trailer home with a green neon TNT sign in the background. Briggs was also frequently visited by one of a succession of 'mail girls', including Honey (Honey Michelle Gregory), Reno, Summer (Kathy Shower), and Rusty (Renner St. John), who not only served as attractive, comedic 'sidekicks,' but also brought Briggs fan letters, sometimes from actual prisoners. TNT also added the segment ''Joe Bob's Last Call'', which was used to showcase the final movie of the night.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910125805/http://www.mondo-video.com/joe-bob-briggs-interview|title=Joe Bob Briggs {{!}} Mondo Film & Video Guide|date=2011-09-10|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531052430/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fP8fKRQ68osJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/111768116/+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=The Courier-Journal from Louisville, Kentucky on January 17, 1997 \u00b7 Page 30|date=2018-05-31|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref> Similarly, the program was occasionally able to feature guests such as rapper and actor [[Ice-T]], and directors [[Wes Craven]] and [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-04/news/9807040131_1_joe-bob-briggs-monstervision-movies|title=\"MonsterVision\": Television isn't just for entertainment... - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Josh Hadley|title=Joe Bob Briggs Monstervision - Hairspray (with John Waters)|date=2017-06-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUjNRKpzwc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> \nWhen it came to the movies, ''MonsterVision'', under Briggs, would sometimes stray away from the typical horror and science fiction films, showing [[Western (genre)|westerns]], [[blaxploitation]], [[kung-fu]], dramas, comedies and other film genres, specifically in the later years. Additionally, as a way to connect fans further to the movies being presented during episodes, ''MonsterVision'' was known for its early use of the internet at [https://web.archive.org/web/19990209012302/http://www.tnt.turner.com/monstervision/ tnt.turner.com/monstervision].

He frequently played on the term \"[[kung fu]]\" to describe action sequences with a particular theme, such as 'Quicksand Fu' in ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''. Briggs' introduction to ''[[Phantasm II]]'', for example, comprised: {{quote|\"Twelve dead bodies. Exploding house. One four-barreled sawed-off shotgun. Dwarf tossing. Ten breasts.

These could be more serious discussions, for example, of trivia about obscure film actors, or controversies such as the race debates around films such as ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. Conversely, Briggs' pieces could be more lighthearted, with deliberately outrageous political statements and occasional banter with his film crew. He frequently described his notional day-to-day activities, including supposed problems with his girlfriends (or lack thereof) and his four ex-wives (usually the fourth, \"Wanda Bodeine\"). Lastly, Briggs usually signed off each episode of ''MonsterVision'' with a casual debriefing on the movie just-ended, along with a series of deliberately bad jokes, and a reminder that \"the Drive-In will never die!\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFurthermore, during these sections, Briggs routinely criticized and lampooned TNT's censorship of the films, with frequent reference to the channel's owner, [[Ted Turner]]. This [[running gag]] culminated with a Halloween marathon of ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' movies, which portrayed strange occurrences throughout the night, leading to Joe Bob realizing that Turner was trying to 'kill' him. The final scene saw Joe Bob give an impassioned apology to Turner, claiming he was an amazing person, before the video feed cut off eerily.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs \"Friday the 13th\" Marathon (complete) on \"Monstervision\"|date=2014-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRUymBAlfk|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> A similar stunt was staged in ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''-themed scenes for a later horror marathon, with the host mysteriously missing.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs -\"Nair Witch Project\"- Carrie - Child's Play 2 - Phantasm 1 & 2|date=2014-10-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoD3EmCY7sc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on June 7, 1997,<ref>''New York Times'', ProQuest, Television Listing - June 7/8, 1997</ref> the series moved to Saturday nights in order to avoid further conflicts with TNT sports broadcasts.

Moving from Dallas to Los Angeles, not only was the general aesthetic of the show changed to feel more 'Hollywood', but the first film of each episode going forward tended to be more 'mainstream', while the second was usually in accordance with traditional ''MonsterVision''. Subsequently, this meant that the ''Joe Bob\u2019s Last Call'' segment would be dropped altogether. Although the original formula of the program was now changed, this transition allowed for more guests, such as [[Rhonda Shear]],<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs w/Rhonda Shear presents \"in the Mouth of Madness\" w/Count Floyd|date=2014-10-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1rDzM_Hes|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> and horror movie specials still remained a staple of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206034829/http://caseycorpier.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-drive-in-will-never-die-story-of.html|title=The Video Creep with Casey C.
