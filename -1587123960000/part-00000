His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} \n\nJohann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn at what is now the [[Beethoven House]] Museum, Bonnstrasse 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beethoven.de/en/about-us#history |title=Beethoven-Haus History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Beethoven-Haus Bonn |publisher= |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions#Hess catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, at whose home he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.

[[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}} These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]].

He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}}\n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201315}}\n\n===1802\u20131812: The 'heroic' period ===\n====Deafness====\n[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]]]]Beethoven told the English pianist [[Charles Neate]] (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=160}} During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223\u201324}} As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}} The cause was probably [[otosclerosis]], perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the [[auditory nerve]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 5}}{{refn|The cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness has also variously been attributed to , amongst other possibilities, [[lead poisoning]] from Beethoven\u2019s preferred wines,{{sfn|Stevens|2013|pp=2854-2858}} and [[Paget's disease of bone]] {{sfn|Oiseth|2015|pp=139\u201347}}|group=n}}\n\nOn the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition.

The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of [[Napoleon]] may have been suggested to Beethoven by [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Count Bernadotte]] in 1798.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 4}} Beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon [[1804 French constitutional referendum|declaring himself Emperor in 1804]], he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 6}} The ''Eroica'' was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]).

[[Egmont (Beethoven)|The result]] (an overture, and nine additional [[entracte]]s and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with Beethoven's \"heroic\" style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, [[Bettina Brentano]] (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which the composer gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onwards.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal]]-[[Archbishop]] and Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolay Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets.

He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. In the event one of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent the composer a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works and enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and Symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness.

In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1053-1056}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n\n=== The \"three periods\" ===\nThe historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works, and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's early biographers, including Schindler [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis|F.-J. F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is the early period in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for  different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout the period in a way that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets known as'late' from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nBeethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements.

This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]].

Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which the composer gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

In the event one of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent the composer a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works and enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and Symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including [[jaundice]] and [[dropsy]], with swollen limbs and  breathing difficulties. Operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from his abdomen.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1017-1024}}\n\nKarl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left at the beginning of January to join  the army at [[Jihlava|Iglau]] and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards \"My dear father [...] I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making Karl his sole heir.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=377}} Later in January Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself.

According to H\u00fcttenbrenner, at about 5 in the afternoon there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: \"Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand  and looked up for several seconds with his first clenched [...] not another breath, not a heartbeat more.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=1050-1051}} Many visitors came to the death-bed; locks of the dead man's hair were retained by H\u00fcttenbrenner and Hiller, amongst others.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=381-382}}{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=44}} An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2011}}{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2012}}{{refn|There is dispute about the cause of his death: [[alcoholic cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.{{sfn|Mai|2006}} Surviving locks of his hair have been subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1863 [[exhumation]].{{sfn|Meredith|2005 |pp=2\u20133}} Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally [[poison]]ed by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.{{sfn|Eisinger|2008}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2007}}|group=n}}\n\nBeethoven's funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.{{sfn|Taruskin|2004|p=687}} [[Franz Schubert]] and the violinist [[Joseph Mayseder]] were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet [[Franz Grillparzer]] was read. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[W\u00e4hring]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1053-1056}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n\n=== The \"three periods\" ===\nThe historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works, and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's early biographers, including Schindler [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis|F.-J. F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is the early period in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for  different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout the period in a way that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhpas the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets known as'late' from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nBeethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]).

Because they all grew up in the same treehouse together, they have developed a really close bond, but they still have very different personalities that often clash in dramatic ways.

The series stars Shaun &mdash; a [[sheep]] previously featured in the 1995 short film ''[[A Close Shave]]'' and in the ''Shopper 13'' short film from the 2002 ''[[Wallace and Gromit's Cracking Contraptions]]'' series &mdash; and his madcap adventures around a small farm as the leader of his flock.\n\nThe series was first aired in the UK on the [[CBBC]] block on [[BBC One]] on 5 March 2007. It has been broadcast in 180 countries globally. The series consists of 150 seven-minute episodes. The fifth series contains 20 episodes and was aired in the Netherlands from 1 December 2015 until 1 January 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yelotv.be/programma/shaun-het-schaap/seizoen_5/aflevering_1/de-redding-nabij- |title= Shaun the Sheep Season 5 |publisher=YeloTV|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpro.nl/speel.POW_02521095.html |title=Shaun the Sheep: De redding nabij?

A feature-length film, titled ''[[Shaun the Sheep Movie]]'', was released theatrically in 2015. A 30-minute film, titled ''[[Shaun the Sheep: The Farmer's Llamas]]'', was aired as a 2015 Christmas TV special. The second feature-length film, titled ''[[A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon]]'', was released theatrically on 18 October 2019.\n\nThe series recently has migrated to [[Netflix]] for a sixth series, under the subtitle ''Adventures from Mossy Bottom''.\n\n== Plot ==\nShaun, an unusually bright and clever sheep, lives with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm (the name being revealed in the fourth season), a traditional small northern English farm. In each episode, their latest attempt to add excitement to their dull mundane life as livestock somehow snowballs into a fantastic [[situational comedy|sitcom]]-style escapade, most often with the help of their fascination with human doings and devices. This usually brings them into conflict\u2014and often into partnership\u2014with the farm sheepdog Bitzer, while they all are simultaneously trying to avoid discovery by the Farmer.\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe show was produced by [[Aardman Animations]], and was commissioned by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) and the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] (WDR),<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeMott|first1=Rick|url=http://www.awn.com/news/aardman-s-shaun-sheep-munches-his-way-around-world |title=Aardman's Shaun The Sheep Munches His Way Around The World |date=19 October 2005|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> a constituent member of the consortium of German public-broadcasting institutions, [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. It has aired on BBC channels in the UK from 2007 onwards.\n\nEach seven-minute episode is entirely shot in Aardman's distinctive [[stop-motion]] animation style. The comedic tone is a combination of [[slapstick]] and classic [[silent comedy]], similar to that used in the ''[[Wallace & Gromit]]'' shorts. In this series, there is not much spoken dialogue at all, even from the human characters; simple grunts, bleats, pointing, sighs, mutterings, words, and similar wordless inflections are all used to indicate each character's moods and motives. There are also no readable words in any episode, although \"Bitzer\" can be seen on a dog bowl, and\u2014in series four--\"Mossy Bottom Farm\" on a gate, in the original English-language title sequence. All other signage, such as on a pizza box or a bus stop, is replaced by an illegible scrawl and a picture.\n\nShaun the Sheep's first appearance was in Wallace & Gromit's third short feature, the [[Academy Award]] winning ''[[A Close Shave]]'', as the youngest member of a flock of sheep Wallace and Gromit work to save from being turned into dog food. He was named Shaun as a pun on the word \"shorn\" after he was accidentally subjected to Wallace's automated [[sheep shearing]] machine. This early version of Shaun shows a hint of his characteristic human-like bravado\u2014among other things, wearing a sweater knitted from his own shorn wool\u2014and he proves to be a major help in saving the day.\n\nAt the end of this short, Shaun is seen living with the duo; Shaun later made a brief cameo appearance in the \"Shopper 13\" episode of Wallace & Gromit's \"[[Cracking Contraptions]]\" web series. No official explanation has been given for the flock's transfer to the farm.\n\nAlthough the original series is silent aside from sound effects, a [[Hindi]]-dubbed version seen on [[Nickelodeon (India)|Nickelodeon India]] was redone with scripts and dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|author1=BestMediaInfo Bureau|title=Nickelodeon brings back \u2018Shaun the Sheep\u2019 in a new avatar|url=http://www.bestmediainfo.com/2012/08/nickelodeon-brings-back-%E2%80%98shaun-the-sheep%E2%80%99-in-a-new-avatar/|publisher=Best Media Info|accessdate=24 October 2015|date=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Wallace and Gromit characters}}\n\n[[File:Richard Goleszowski.jpg|thumb|right|Series director Richard Goleszowski at Canterbury's Anifest 2008 with models of a generic sheep, Bitzer, Timmy, and Shaun]]\n\n=== Main ===\n*Shaun is the [[protagonist]] of the series and the leader of the flock. He is a clever, confident sheep, prone to mischief, but equally adept at getting himself and/or his friends out of it. As there is no dialogue, like all the sheep he communicates entirely through bleating, and often explains his ideas to the flock by drawing diagrams on a blackboard. He has a good friendship with Bitzer, though this does not stop him from playing pranks on him at times. \n*Bitzer <!-- discussion taken to Talk --Lexein -->is the farmer's loyal, long-suffering [[Herding dog|sheepdog]], dressed for work in a blue knit cap, black collar, knitted wristlet and large official-looking wrist-watch, carrying a clipboard and walking upright or on all fours as needed. He communicates, canine-fashion, via barks, growls, and the occasional whimper. He also gives instructions to the flock by blowing a whistle. Despite a tendency to be caught out listening to music, he takes his job very seriously, to the point of occasionally letting his power go to his head. He is however a generally good friend to Shaun and does his best to keep the whole flock out of trouble.\n*Shirley is the largest member of the flock. A gentle giant, she is usually seen placidly eating, though she's intimidating enough to have defended Shaun from Pidsley the cat. She's so big that large objects routinely disappear into her fleece, and she quite often gets stuck herself, needing the other sheep to push, pull or even sling-shot her out of trouble. However, her size can also come in very handy when what's needed is a battering ram or similarly immovable object. She is a devoted eater, blindly charging towards food, even if it isn't even food in the first place. Her size came from her eating, yet it has been proven that by following a diet and exercising, she can become as thin as Shaun.\n*Timmy, Shaun's cousin, is the flock's only lamb and thus often the innocent centre of the chaos. Timmy often tries to be like Shaun. His personality is often contrasting: sometimes he acts responsibly and understands what the older sheep say, other times, he acts as a normal baby, crying when something is taken from him or scares him. He\u2019s a toddler in series, and is often seen sucking a [[Pacifier|dummy]]. The spinoff series ''[[Timmy Time]]'' chronicles his later adventures in preschool.\n*Timmy's Mother, Shaun's Aunt, wears curlers in her topknot and is a bit careless about maternal duties, even using Timmy once as a makeshift paint brush. But when her offspring goes astray, she is inconsolable until he is safely back in her care.\n*Nuts is quite an eccentric, but useful sheep and usually, like the rest of the flock, accompanies and helps Shaun. But the thing that makes him stand out from the flock is that he has two different shaped eyes and a different shaped nose.\n*Hazel - Hazel's nerves often get the better of her. She's a timid little sheep who jumps at the slightest thing and can frequently be heard bleating nervously. When Farmer's caravan rolls off towards the city, Hazel can barely contain her fear \u2013 this is the stuff of nightmares! But when she finds herself carried along with the rest of the Flock in hot pursuit of a runaway caravan, Hazel discovers she's much braver than she ever imagined, and that while life in the city might be scary, it's good to face your fears every now and again.\n*The Flock, like typical sheep, tend to follow Shaun and one another, are obedient to orders and generally form one big happy if sometimes fractious family group. Unlike Shaun, however, they are not particularly bright, which becomes a problem when combined with their ongoing fascination with the human world. It's usually Shaun and Bitzer who sort out the resulting mess. \n*The Farmer is a bespectacled, balding man who runs the farm with Bitzer at his side and acts as the flock's primary if unwitting nemesis. His livestock's main concern is to ensure he remains completely oblivious to their unusual sentience, a task made easier by his conventional, unobservant nature but complicated by his enthusiasm for picking up new hobbies. He can be heard frequently making wordless noises or muttering under his breath ''just'' audibly enough for the viewer to pick up on his meaning. His disastrous attempts at dating are a running joke of the series. In the 2015 movie, he is referred to as Mr. X by those who don't know his identity.\n*The Naughty [[Pig|Pigs]], whose pen is adjacent to the sheepfield, are bullies to Shaun and his flock, always trying to antagonize them and get them into trouble. They are, however, scared of Bitzer (though they still take the chance to bully him whenever possible), and they get told off by the Farmer in \"Pig Trouble\".\n*Pidsley is the Farmer's orange [[cat]], a minor character (without fur) in Series 1 and the main antagonist of Series 2, who makes his last appearance in \"We Wish Ewe A Merry Christmas\".  He desires to be the sole recipient of the Farmer's attention and thus is jealous of Bitzer.  He also dislikes the sheep, thinking of them as stupid and beneath him.\n\n===Other===\n*Mower Mouth is a [[goat]] who first appears in the episode of the same name. He is an unstoppable eating machine. While not an unfriendly character, all of his considerable energy is focused on his next meal. He thus routinely causes trouble for Shaun and the flock, as also seen in \"Shaun the Farmer\".\n*The [[Bull]] is belligerent, powerful, and easily provoked by Shaun's antics and the colour red. He appears in \"The Bull\", \"Saturday Night Shaun\", \"Who's the Mummy?\" and \"Heavy Metal Shaun\".\n*The [[Duck|Ducks]] make frequent appearances. In the first series, a single duck gets into predicaments due to Shaun's exploits in \"Off the Baa!\", \"Tidy Up\", and \"Bathtime\". Sometimes he is seen with his lady friends. In series two there are two ducks; in series three, they have once again been replaced with a single, pure white duck.\n*The [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|Aliens]] appear in \"Shaun Encounters\", \"The Visitor\" and \"Cat Got Your Brain\" and briefly in \"Spring Lamb\".  They are green and have one large eye on the top of the head. Despite their clearly advanced scientific technology, which frequently causes trouble for the farm animals, they exhibit human-like behaviour and generally jovial personalities.\n*The Granny is a short-tempered, short-sighted old lady, appearing in \"Take Away\" and \"Save the Tree\". She also appears in \"Two's Company\", holding a cart, and \"The Big Chase\", forcing the pigs to give her a lift in their car. She is renowned for hitting people (or animals) with her handbag when they annoy her by mistake.\n*The Pizza Delivery Boy is a young man who rides a [[moped]] (which Bitzer often \"borrows\" to chase after the sheep) and works in the local [[pizzeria]]. He also works as a postman in \"Saturday Night Shaun\".\n*The Farmer's Girlfriend appears for the first time in Series 2. She appears to be adventurous and an animal lover, patting Bitzer and Shaun and offering food to Timmy.\n*The Farmer's Niece appears in \"The Farmer's Niece\", \"Bitzer's New Hat\" and \"The Rabbit\". She appears to be a fan of [[Horse|horses]] and causes irritation to Shaun, Bitzer and the flock. The Farmer's Niece is also a spoiled brat, as she screams and wails every time things don't go her way.

These include:\n* Shirley's training in the episode \"Shape Up with Shaun\" is based on the film ''[[Rocky]]''.\n* The paintings parodied in \"Still Life\" include the ''[[Mona Lisa]] ''and Constable's ''[[The Hay Wain]]''.\n* In \"Buzz Off Bees\", the Farmer appears in his hooded beekeepers outfit, with accompanying [[Darth Vader]]-style heavy breathing.\n* The infamous shower scene from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is spoofed in the episode \"The Little Sheep of Horrors\", whose name is itself  based on the film and play  ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.\n* In \"Hiccups\", Shaun turns his guitar amplifier up to 11 in a reference to a scene in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.\n*In \"Fleeced\", at the beginning of episode when the farmer switches on the shearing machine in front of the frightened flock, it is a reference to Tobe Hooper's ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', especially when the farmer grabs the sheep and drags it into the shearing room and jerkily closes the metal door after him - this is a reference to the scene from same film where the crazy masked killer with the chainsaw catches his victim in his killing room and closes its doors after him.<ref>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</ref> The sheep break out and the accompanying music is very reminiscent of British [[World War II]] [[prisoner of war]] films (e.g., ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'')\n* In \"The Visitor\", the alien thrashes his car with a tree branch \u00e0 la [[Basil Fawlty]].\n* In \"Mountains out of Molehills\" a sheep is reading a magazine called \"Bleat\", a spoof of celebrity gossip magazine \"[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]\". In the same episode, Shaun tries to catch a mole with a fishing rod and line. When the first \"bite\" is shown, the first two notes of the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' theme are played.\n* Near the end of \"Off the Baa\", the  \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" theme from [[Puccini]]'s opera ''[[Turandot]]'' is used, which was the musical theme of the BBC's coverage of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The episode itself featured Shaun and the rest of the flock engaging in a football game with Bitzer as the referee.\n* At the end of \"Mower Mouth\" the shrubs are clearly reminiscent of those in ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''.\n* In \"Saturday Night Shaun\" Shaun rips off his coat and tosses it away as he is dancing, only to have it tossed back. This is reminiscent of the scene in the 1980 movie ''[[Airplane!]]'', where [[Robert Hays]] tosses his white sport-coat away, only to have it tossed back in his face.\n* In \"Party Animals\", one of the sheep is dressed as a crude version of a [[Dalek]] trying to get up some stairs but failing because of the suit.\n* In \"Bitzer from the Black Lagoon\", Shaun cannot start the Farmer's truck and hits his head on the horn to get it started. This is a reference to ''[[Back to the Future]]''. \n* In \"Zebra Ducks of the Serengeti\", the Farmer's signpost over the gate falls over Bitzer - \u00e0 la Buster Keaton in ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]''\n* In \"An Ill Wind\", when the power supply to the farmhouse blows up, the Farmer grabs an axe and chops his wind turbine in a similar fashion to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\n* In \"Shaun Encounters\", two alien kids throw a bone for Bitzer. He catches the bone to ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' music. The scene is close related to the first scene with the apes in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n* In \"Pig Trouble,\" the background music when the Farmer makes the pigs in charge of the flock is the song \"If I Had Words\". This is a reference to the movie ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'', which is about a pig becoming a sheep-herding pig.\n\n== Spin-off ==\n\n=== ''Timmy Time'' ===\n\n{{Main|Timmy Time}}\n\nIn 2009, [[Aardman Animations]] released [[Timmy Time]], a [[CBeebies]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series aimed at preschoolers.

[[stop-motion]] [[animated]] television series [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' franchise.  The series stars Shaun &mdash; a [[sheep]] previously featured in the 1995 short film ''[[A Close Shave]]'' and in the ''Shopper 13'' short film from the 2002 ''[[Wallace and Gromit's Cracking Contraptions]]'' series &mdash; and his madcap adventures around a small farm as the leader of his flock.\n\nThe series was first aired in the UK on the [[CBBC]] block on [[BBC One]] on 5 March 2007. It has been broadcast in 180 countries globally. The series consists of 150 seven-minute episodes. The fifth series contains 20 episodes and was aired in the Netherlands from 1 December 2015 until 1 January 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yelotv.be/programma/shaun-het-schaap/seizoen_5/aflevering_1/de-redding-nabij- |title= Shaun the Sheep Season 5 |publisher=YeloTV|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpro.nl/speel.POW_02521095.html |title=Shaun the Sheep: De redding nabij?

A feature-length film, titled ''[[Shaun the Sheep Movie]]'', was released theatrically in 2015. A 30-minute film, titled ''[[Shaun the Sheep: The Farmer's Llamas]]'', was aired as a 2015 Christmas TV special. The second feature-length film, titled ''[[A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon]]'', was released theatrically on 18 October 2019.\n\nThe series recently has migrated to [[Netflix]] for a sixth series, under the subtitle ''Adventures from Mossy Bottom''.\n\n== Plot ==\nShaun, an unusually bright and clever sheep, lives with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm (the name being revealed in the fourth season), a traditional small northern English farm. In each episode, their latest attempt to add excitement to their dull mundane life as livestock somehow snowballs into a fantastic [[situational comedy|sitcom]]-style escapade, most often with the help of their fascination with human doings and devices. This usually brings them into conflict\u2014and often into partnership\u2014with the farm sheepdog Bitzer, while they all are simultaneously trying to avoid discovery by the Farmer.\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe show was produced by [[Aardman Animations]], and was commissioned by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) and the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] (WDR),<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeMott|first1=Rick|url=http://www.awn.com/news/aardman-s-shaun-sheep-munches-his-way-around-world |title=Aardman's Shaun The Sheep Munches His Way Around The World |date=19 October 2005|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> a constituent member of the consortium of German public-broadcasting institutions, [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. It has aired on BBC channels in the UK from 2007 onwards.\n\nEach seven-minute episode is entirely shot in Aardman's distinctive [[stop-motion]] animation style. The comedic tone is a combination of [[slapstick]] and classic [[silent comedy]], similar to that used in the ''[[Wallace & Gromit]]'' shorts. In this series, there is not much spoken dialogue at all, even from the human characters; simple grunts, bleats, pointing, sighs, mutterings, words, and similar wordless inflections are all used to indicate each character's moods and motives. There are also no readable words in any episode, although \"Bitzer\" can be seen on a dog bowl, and\u2014in series four--\"Mossy Bottom Farm\" on a gate, in the original English-language title sequence. All other signage, such as on a pizza box or a bus stop, is replaced by an illegible scrawl and a picture.\n\nShaun the Sheep's first appearance was in Wallace & Gromit's third short feature, the [[Academy Award]] winning ''[[A Close Shave]]'', as the youngest member of a flock of sheep Wallace and Gromit work to save from being turned into dog food. He was named Shaun as a pun on the word \"shorn\" after he was accidentally subjected to Wallace's automated [[sheep shearing]] machine. This early version of Shaun shows a hint of his characteristic human-like bravado\u2014among other things, wearing a sweater knitted from his own shorn wool\u2014and he proves to be a major help in saving the day.\n\nAt the end of this short, Shaun is seen living with the duo; Shaun later made a brief cameo appearance in the \"Shopper 13\" episode of Wallace & Gromit's \"[[Cracking Contraptions]]\" web series. No official explanation has been given for the flock's transfer to the farm.\n\nAlthough the original series is silent aside from sound effects, a [[Hindi]]-dubbed version seen on [[Nickelodeon (India)|Nickelodeon India]] was redone with scripts and dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|author1=BestMediaInfo Bureau|title=Nickelodeon brings back \u2018Shaun the Sheep\u2019 in a new avatar|url=http://www.bestmediainfo.com/2012/08/nickelodeon-brings-back-%E2%80%98shaun-the-sheep%E2%80%99-in-a-new-avatar/|publisher=Best Media Info|accessdate=24 October 2015|date=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Wallace and Gromit characters}}\n\n[[File:Richard Goleszowski.jpg|thumb|right|Series director Richard Goleszowski at Canterbury's Anifest 2008 with models of a generic sheep, Bitzer, Timmy, and Shaun]]\n\n=== Main ===\n*Shaun is the [[protagonist]] of the series and the leader of the flock. He is a clever, confident sheep, prone to mischief, but equally adept at getting himself and/or his friends out of it. As there is no dialogue, like all the sheep he communicates entirely through bleating, and often explains his ideas to the flock by drawing diagrams on a blackboard. He has a good friendship with Bitzer, though this does not stop him from playing pranks on him at times. \n*Bitzer <!-- discussion taken to Talk --Lexein -->is the farmer's loyal, long-suffering [[Herding dog|sheepdog]], dressed for work in a blue knit cap, black collar, knitted wristlet and large official-looking wrist-watch, carrying a clipboard and walking upright or on all fours as needed. He communicates, canine-fashion, via barks, growls, and the occasional whimper. He also gives instructions to the flock by blowing a whistle. Despite a tendency to be caught out listening to music, he takes his job very seriously, to the point of occasionally letting his power go to his head. He is however a generally good friend to Shaun and does his best to keep the whole flock out of trouble.\n*Shirley is the largest member of the flock. A gentle giant, she is usually seen placidly eating, though she's intimidating enough to have defended Shaun from Pidsley the cat. She's so big that large objects routinely disappear into her fleece, and she quite often gets stuck herself, needing the other sheep to push, pull or even sling-shot her out of trouble. However, her size can also come in very handy when what's needed is a battering ram or similarly immovable object. She is a devoted eater, blindly charging towards food, even if it isn't even food in the first place. Her size came from her eating, yet it has been proven that by following a diet and exercising, she can become as thin as Shaun.\n*Timmy, Shaun's cousin, is the flock's only lamb and thus often the innocent centre of the chaos. Timmy often tries to be like Shaun. His personality is often contrasting: sometimes he acts responsibly and understands what the older sheep say, other times, he acts as a normal baby, crying when something is taken from him or scares him. He\u2019s a toddler in series, and is often seen sucking a [[Pacifier|dummy]]. The spinoff series ''[[Timmy Time]]'' chronicles his later adventures in preschool.\n*Timmy's Mother, Shaun's Aunt, wears curlers in her topknot and is a bit careless about maternal duties, even using Timmy once as a makeshift paint brush. But when her offspring goes astray, she is inconsolable until he is safely back in her care.\n*Nuts is quite an eccentric, but useful sheep and usually, like the rest of the flock, accompanies and helps Shaun. But the thing that makes him stand out from the flock is that he has two different shaped eyes and a different shaped nose.\n*Hazel - Hazel's nerves often get the better of her. She's a timid little sheep who jumps at the slightest thing and can frequently be heard bleating nervously. When Farmer's caravan rolls off towards the city, Hazel can barely contain her fear \u2013 this is the stuff of nightmares! But when she finds herself carried along with the rest of the Flock in hot pursuit of a runaway caravan, Hazel discovers she's much braver than she ever imagined, and that while life in the city might be scary, it's good to face your fears every now and again.\n*The Flock, like typical sheep, tend to follow Shaun and one another, are obedient to orders and generally form one big happy if sometimes fractious family group. Unlike Shaun, however, they are not particularly bright, which becomes a problem when combined with their ongoing fascination with the human world. It's usually Shaun and Bitzer who sort out the resulting mess. \n*The Farmer is a bespectacled, balding man who runs the farm with Bitzer at his side and acts as the flock's primary if unwitting nemesis. His livestock's main concern is to ensure he remains completely oblivious to their unusual sentience, a task made easier by his conventional, unobservant nature but complicated by his enthusiasm for picking up new hobbies. He can be heard frequently making wordless noises or muttering under his breath ''just'' audibly enough for the viewer to pick up on his meaning. His disastrous attempts at dating are a running joke of the series. In the 2015 movie, he is referred to as Mr. X by those who don't know his identity.\n*The Naughty [[Pig|Pigs]], whose pen is adjacent to the sheepfield, are bullies to Shaun and his flock, always trying to antagonize them and get them into trouble. They are, however, scared of Bitzer (though they still take the chance to bully him whenever possible), and they get told off by the Farmer in \"Pig Trouble\".\n*Pidsley is the Farmer's orange [[cat]], a minor character (without fur) in Series 1 and the main antagonist of Series 2, who makes his last appearance in \"We Wish Ewe A Merry Christmas\".  He desires to be the sole recipient of the Farmer's attention and thus is jealous of Bitzer.  He also dislikes the sheep, thinking of them as stupid and beneath him.\n\n===Other===\n*Mower Mouth is a [[goat]] who first appears in the episode of the same name. He is an unstoppable eating machine. While not an unfriendly character, all of his considerable energy is focused on his next meal. He thus routinely causes trouble for Shaun and the flock, as also seen in \"Shaun the Farmer\".\n*The [[Bull]] is belligerent, powerful, and easily provoked by Shaun's antics and the colour red. He appears in \"The Bull\", \"Saturday Night Shaun\", \"Who's the Mummy?\" and \"Heavy Metal Shaun\".\n*The [[Duck|Ducks]] make frequent appearances. In the first series, a single duck gets into predicaments due to Shaun's exploits in \"Off the Baa!\", \"Tidy Up\", and \"Bathtime\". Sometimes he is seen with his lady friends. In series two there are two ducks; in series three, they have once again been replaced with a single, pure white duck.\n*The [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|Aliens]] appear in \"Shaun Encounters\", \"The Visitor\" and \"Cat Got Your Brain\" and briefly in \"Spring Lamb\".  They are green and have one large eye on the top of the head. Despite their clearly advanced scientific technology, which frequently causes trouble for the farm animals, they exhibit human-like behaviour and generally jovial personalities.\n*The Granny is a short-tempered, short-sighted old lady, appearing in \"Take Away\" and \"Save the Tree\". She also appears in \"Two's Company\", holding a cart, and \"The Big Chase\", forcing the pigs to give her a lift in their car. She is renowned for hitting people (or animals) with her handbag when they annoy her by mistake.\n*The Pizza Delivery Boy is a young man who rides a [[moped]] (which Bitzer often \"borrows\" to chase after the sheep) and works in the local [[pizzeria]]. He also works as a postman in \"Saturday Night Shaun\".\n*The Farmer's Girlfriend appears for the first time in Series 2. She appears to be adventurous and an animal lover, patting Bitzer and Shaun and offering food to Timmy.\n*The Farmer's Niece appears in \"The Farmer's Niece\", \"Bitzer's New Hat\" and \"The Rabbit\".

These include:\n* Shirley's training in the episode \"Shape Up with Shaun\" is based on the film ''[[Rocky]]''.\n* The paintings parodied in \"Still Life\" include the ''[[Mona Lisa]] ''and Constable's ''[[The Hay Wain]]''.\n* In \"Buzz Off Bees\", the Farmer appears in his hooded beekeepers outfit, with accompanying [[Darth Vader]]-style heavy breathing.\n* The infamous shower scene from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is spoofed in the episode \"The Little Sheep of Horrors\", whose name is itself  based on the film and play  ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.\n* In \"Hiccups\", Shaun turns his guitar amplifier up to 11 in a reference to a scene in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.\n*In \"Fleeced\", at the beginning of episode when the farmer switches on the shearing machine in front of the frightened flock, it is a reference to Tobe Hooper's ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', especially when the farmer grabs the sheep and drags it into the shearing room and jerkily closes the metal door after him - this is a reference to the scene from same film where the crazy masked killer with the chainsaw catches his victim in his killing room and closes its doors after him.<ref>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</ref> The sheep break out and the accompanying music is very reminiscent of British [[World War II]] [[prisoner of war]] films (e.g., ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'')\n* In \"The Visitor\", the alien thrashes his car with a tree branch \u00e0 la [[Basil Fawlty]].\n* In \"Mountains out of Molehills\" a sheep is reading a magazine called \"Bleat\", a spoof of celebrity gossip magazine \"[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]\". In the same episode, Shaun tries to catch a mole with a fishing rod and line. When the first \"bite\" is shown, the first two notes of the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' theme are played.\n* Near the end of \"Off the Baa\", the  \"[[Nessun Dorma]]\" theme from [[Puccini]]'s opera ''[[Turandot]]'' is used, which was the musical theme of the BBC's coverage of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The episode itself featured Shaun and the rest of the flock engaging in a football game with Bitzer as the referee.\n* At the end of \"Mower Mouth\" the shrubs are clearly reminiscent of those in ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''.\n* In \"Saturday Night Shaun\" Shaun rips off his coat and tosses it away as he is dancing, only to have it tossed back. This is reminiscent of the scene in the 1980 movie ''[[Airplane!]]'', where [[Robert Hays]] tosses his white sport-coat away, only to have it tossed back in his face.\n* In \"Party Animals\", one of the sheep is dressed as a crude version of a [[Dalek]] trying to get up some stairs but failing because of the suit.\n* In \"Bitzer from the Black Lagoon\", Shaun cannot start the Farmer's truck and hits his head on the horn to get it started. This is a reference to ''[[Back to the Future]]''. \n* In \"Zebra Ducks of the Serengeti\", the Farmer's signpost over the gate falls over Bitzer - \u00e0 la Buster Keaton in ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]''\n* In \"An Ill Wind\", when the power supply to the farmhouse blows up, the Farmer grabs an axe and chops his wind turbine in a similar fashion to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\n* In \"Shaun Encounters\", two alien kids throw a bone for Bitzer. He catches the bone to ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' music. The scene is close related to the first scene with the apes in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n* In \"Pig Trouble,\" the background music when the Farmer makes the pigs in charge of the flock is the song \"If I Had Words\". This is a reference to the movie ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'', which is about a pig becoming a sheep-herding pig.\n\n== Spin-off ==\n\n=== ''Timmy Time'' ===\n\n{{Main|Timmy Time}}\n\nIn 2009, [[Aardman Animations]] released [[Timmy Time]], a [[CBeebies]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series aimed at preschoolers.
