A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences. After his return from the war, Evola experimented with [[hallucinogen]]s and magic.\n\nWhen he was about 23 years old, Evola considered suicide. He claimed that he avoided suicide thanks to a revelation he had while reading an early Buddhist text that dealt with shedding all forms of identity other than absolute transcendence.<ref name=\"Furlong 2011\" /> Evola would later publish the text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', which he regarded as a repayment of his debt to [[Buddhism]] for saving him from suicide.<ref name=forum/>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nEvola wrote prodigiously on Eastern mysticism, Tantra, [[hermeticism]], the myth of the Holy Grail and Western esotericism.<ref name=\"Furlong 2011\" />{{page needed|date=August 2019}} German Egyptologist and esoteric scholar Florian Ebeling has noted that Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' is viewed as an \"extremely important work on Hermeticism\" in the eyes of esotericists.<ref>Florian Ebeling.

In this work, Evola called Italy's fascist movement a \"laughable revolution,\" based on empty sentiment and materialistic concerns. He applauded Mussolini's anti-bourgeois orientation and his goal of making Italian citizens into hardened warriors, but criticized Fascist populism, party politics, and elements of leftism that he saw in the fascist regime. Evola saw Mussolini's Fascist Party as possessing no cultural or spiritual foundation.

Evola later recounted that Mussolini had found in his work a uniquely Roman form of Fascist [[racism]] distinct from that found in [[Nazi Germany]]. With Mussolini's backing, Evola launched the minor journal ''Sangue e Spirito'' (Blood and Spirit). While not always in agreement with German racial theorists, Evola traveled to Germany in February 1942 and obtained support for German collaboration on ''Sangue e Spirito'' from \"key figures in the German racial hierarchy.\"<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2002\"/> Fascists appreciated the [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] value of Evola's \"proof\" \"that the true representatives of the state and the culture of ancient Rome were people of the Nordic race.\"<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2002\"/> Evola eventually became Italy's leading racial philosopher.<ref name=Payne/>\n\nEvola blended [[Sorelianism]] with Mussolini's [[eugenics]] agenda. Evola has written that \"The theory of the Aryo-Roman race and its corresponding myth could integrate the Roman idea proposed, in general, by fascism, as well as give a foundation to Mussolini's plan to use his state as a means to elevate the average Italian and to enucleate in him a new man.\"<ref>Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.54</ref>\n\nIn May, 1951, Evola was arrested and charged with promoting the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers who certainly could be linked to fascism\u2014at least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria\u2014but who certainly could not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini.

In this work, Evola described the features of his idealized traditional society. Evola argued that modernity represented a serious decline from an ideal society. He argued that in the postulated Golden age, religious and temporal power were united. He wrote that society had not been founded on priestly rule, but by warriors expressing spiritual power. In mythology, he saw evidence of the West's superiority over the East.

He began reading various esoteric texts and gradually delved deeper into the occult, [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Oriental studies]], particularly [[Vajrayana|Tibetan Tantric]] [[yoga]]. A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences. After his return from the war, Evola experimented with [[hallucinogen]]s and magic.\n\nWhen he was about 23 years old, Evola considered suicide. He claimed that he avoided suicide thanks to a revelation he had while reading an early Buddhist text that dealt with shedding all forms of identity other than absolute transcendence.<ref name=\"Furlong 2011\" /> Evola would later publish the text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', which he regarded as a repayment of his debt to [[Buddhism]] for saving him from suicide.<ref name=forum/>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nEvola wrote prodigiously on Eastern mysticism, Tantra, [[hermeticism]], the myth of the Holy Grail and Western esotericism.<ref name=\"Furlong 2011\" />{{page needed|date=August 2019}} German Egyptologist and esoteric scholar Florian Ebeling has noted that Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' is viewed as an \"extremely important work on Hermeticism\" in the eyes of esotericists.<ref>Florian Ebeling.

Payne. ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia''. Simon and Schuster, 2006. p. 229</ref>\n\nEvola advocated that \"differentiated individuals\" following the [[Left-Hand Path]] use dark violent sexual powers against the modern world. For Evola, these \"virile heroes\" are both generous and cruel, possess the ability to rule, and commit \"Dionysian\" acts that might be seen as conventionally immoral. For Evola, the Left Hand path embraces violence as a means of transgression.<ref name=occult/>{{rp|217}}\n\nAccording to [[A.

He felt that Indo-European men had devolved from these higher mythological races.<ref name=\"Furlong 2011\" /> Gregor noted that several contemporary criticisms of Evola's theory were published: \"In one of Fascism's most important theoretical journals, Evola's critic pointed out that many Nordic-Aryans, not to speak of Mediterranean Aryans, fail to demonstrate any Hyperborean properties.

How do they differ from 'inferior' races, and why should anyone wish, in any way, to favor them?\"<ref name=gregor2006/>{{rp|106}}\n\nConcerning the relationship between \"spiritual racism\" and biological racism, Evola put forth the following viewpoint, which Furlong described as pseudo-scientific:\n\n{{quote|The factor of \"blood\" or \"race\" has its importance, because it is not psychologically\u2014in the brain or the opinions of the individual\u2014but in the very deepest forces of life that traditions live and act as typical formative energies.

In this work, Evola called Italy's fascist movement a \"laughable revolution,\" based on empty sentiment and materialistic concerns. He applauded Mussolini's anti-bourgeois orientation and his goal of making Italian citizens into hardened warriors, but criticized Fascist populism, party politics, and elements of leftism that he saw in the fascist regime. Evola saw Mussolini's Fascist Party as possessing no cultural or spiritual foundation. He was passionate about infusing it with these elements in order to make it suitable for his ideal conception of ''\u00dcbermensch'' culture which, in Evola's view, characterized the imperial grandeur of pre-Christian Europe.<ref name=occult/>{{page needed|date=August 2019}} He expressed anti-nationalist sentiment, stating that to become \"truly human,\" one would have to \"overcome brotherly contamination\" and \"purge oneself\" of the feeling that one is united with others \"because of blood, affections, country or human destiny.\" He also opposed the [[futurism]] that Italian fascism was aligned with, along with the \"plebeian\" nature of the movement.<ref name=gregor2006/>{{rp|86}} Accordingly, Evola launched the journal ''La Torre'' (The Tower), to voice his concerns and advocate for a more elitist fascism.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2002\"/> Evola's ideas were poorly received by the fascist mainstream as it stood at the time of his writing.<ref name=Sedgwick/>\n\n===Mussolini===\n[[File:Evola-40.jpg|thumb|Julius Evola (1940)]]\nScholars disagree about why [[Benito Mussolini]] embraced racist ideology in 1938\u2014some scholars have written that Mussolini was more motivated by political considerations than ideology when he introduced anti-semitic legislation in Italy.<ref>''See'' Renzo de Felice, ''Storia degli ebrei''; [[A. James Gregor]]; Meir Michaelis, ''Mussolini and the Jews''; ''contra'' Aaron Gillette, ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy'', Ch. 4</ref> Other scholars have rejected the argument that the racial ideology of Italian fascism could be attributed solely to Nazi influence.<ref>''See'' Luigi Preti (1968) for discussion of [[miscegenation]]; Gene Bernardini (1977) for discussion of German influence</ref> A more recent interpretation is that Mussolini was frustrated by the slow pace of fascist transformation and, by 1938, had adopted increasingly radical measures including a racial ideology. Aaron Gillette has written that \"Racism would become the key driving force behind the creation of the new fascist man, the ''uomo fascista''.\"<ref>Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.51-53</ref>\n\nMussolini read Evola's ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' in August 1941, and met with Evola to offer him his praise. Evola later recounted that Mussolini had found in his work a uniquely Roman form of Fascist [[racism]] distinct from that found in [[Nazi Germany]]. With Mussolini's backing, Evola launched the minor journal ''Sangue e Spirito'' (Blood and Spirit). While not always in agreement with German racial theorists, Evola traveled to Germany in February 1942 and obtained support for German collaboration on ''Sangue e Spirito'' from \"key figures in the German racial hierarchy.\"<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2002\"/> Fascists appreciated the [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] value of Evola's \"proof\" \"that the true representatives of the state and the culture of ancient Rome were people of the Nordic race.\"<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2002\"/> Evola eventually became Italy's leading racial philosopher.<ref name=Payne/>\n\nEvola blended [[Sorelianism]] with Mussolini's [[eugenics]] agenda. Evola has written that \"The theory of the Aryo-Roman race and its corresponding myth could integrate the Roman idea proposed, in general, by fascism, as well as give a foundation to Mussolini's plan to use his state as a means to elevate the average Italian and to enucleate in him a new man.\"<ref>Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.54</ref>\n\nIn May, 1951, Evola was arrested and charged with promoting the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers who certainly could be linked to fascism\u2014at least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria\u2014but who certainly could not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini. Evola then declared that he was not a Fascist but was instead \"{{lang|it|superfascisti}}\" ({{literal translation|superfascist}}).

The Caucasus campaign extended from the [[South Caucasus]] to the [[Armenian Highlands]] region, reaching as far as [[Trabzon]], [[Bitlis]], [[Mu\u015f|Mush]] and [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. The land warfare was accompanied by the Russian navy in the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea Region]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nOn February 23, 1917, the Russian advance was halted following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], and later the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] disintegrated and was replaced by the forces of the newly established Armenian state, comprising [[Armenian volunteer units]] and [[Armenian irregular units|irregular units]] which had previously been part of the Russian Army. During 1918 the region also saw the establishment of the Central Caspian Dictatorship, the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] and an Allied intervention force, nicknamed [[Dunsterforce]], composed of troops drawn from the Mesopotamian and Western Fronts. The Ottoman Empire and the [[German Empire]] had a hot conflict at Batumi with the arrival of the [[German Caucasus Expedition]] whose prime aim was to secure oil supplies.\n\nOn March 3, 1918, the campaign terminated between the Ottoman Empire and Russia with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and on June 4, 1918, the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Treaty of Batum]] with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. However, the armed conflicts continued as Ottoman Empire was still engaged with the Central Caspian Dictatorship, Republic of Mountainous Armenia and Dunsterforce of the British Empire until the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on October 30, 1918.\n\nThe [[Armenian Genocide]] was carried out during the course of the campaign.\n\n== Background ==\nThe main objective of the Ottoman Empire was the recovery of territory in the [[Caucasus]], including regions captured by the Russian empire as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u201378]]. The strategic goals of the Caucasus campaign for Ottoman forces was to retake [[Artvin]], [[Ardahan]], [[Kars]], and the port of [[Batum]]. A success in this region would mean a diversion of Russian forces to this front from the Polish and Galician fronts.<ref name=\"caven 1\">{{cite book |last=Hinterhoff |first=Eugene |title=Persia: The Stepping Stone To India |series=Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I |volume=4 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation |year=1984 |location=New York |isbn=0-86307-181-3 |pages=499\u2013503 }}</ref> A Caucasus campaign would have a distracting effect on Russian forces.

The Eastern Front had the most Russian manpower and resources. Russia had taken the city of [[Kars]] from the Turks in 1877 and feared an Ottoman advance into the Caucasus aimed at retaking Kars and the port of Batum. In March 1915 the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] foreign minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] stated in a meeting with [[British Empire|British]] ambassador [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|George Buchanan]] and French Ambassador [[Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue]] that a lasting postwar settlement demanded full Russian possession of Constantinople (the capital city of the Ottoman Empire), the straits of [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], southern [[Thrace]] up to the Enos-Midia line as well as parts of the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea coast]] of Anatolia between the Bosphorus, the [[Sakarya River]] and an undetermined point near the Bay of [[Izmit]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald Park |last=Bobroff |title=Roads to glory \u2013 Late Imperial Russia and the Turkish Straits |location=London |publisher=I.B.

The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] was in the proposed path of Ottoman ambitions, and owned the exclusive rights to work petroleum deposits throughout the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian Empire]] except in the provinces of [[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Gilan Province|Ghilan]], Mazendaran, Asdrabad and Khorasan.<ref name=\"oilfactor\" /> In 1914, before the war, the British government had contracted with the company for the supply of oil-fuel for the navy.<ref name=\"oilfactor\" />\n\n== Forces ==\n\n=== Ottomans ===\nThe Ottomans had one army based in the region, the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|3rd Army]].  In 1916 they sent reinforcements and formed the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|2nd Army]].  At the beginning of the conflict, the combined forces of the Ottomans ranged from 100,000 to 190,000 men. Many were poorly equipped.\n\n=== Russia ===\nBefore the war, Russia had the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] stationed here, with 100,000 men under the nominal command of the Governor-General of the Caucasus [[Vorontsov|Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov]]. The real commander was his chief of staff General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Nikolai Yudenich]]. At the onset of the Caucasus campaign, the Russians had to redeploy almost half of their forces to the Prussian front due to the defeats at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]], leaving behind just 60,000 troops. However, This Army had lots of Armenian support.  It had Armenian generals [[Tovmas Nazarbekian|Nazarbekov]], [[Movses Silikyan|Silikian]], and Pirumov who stayed in Caucasia. The Russian Caucasus Army dissipated in 1917 as the regular Russian regiments deserted the front line after the revolution.

It was initially established as detachment units (rather than part of Russian Caucasus Command) under the Viceroyalty of the Caucasus. These forces were commanded by [[Andranik Ozanian]]. Other leaders included [[Drastamat Kanayan]], [[Hamazasp Srvandztyan]], [[Arshak Gafavian]], and [[Sargis Mehrabyan]]. An Ottoman representative [[Karekin Bastermadjian]] (Armen Karo) was also united to this force. Initially, they had 20,000 men, but throughout the conflicts, it was reported that their number increased. At the turn of 1916, Nikolai Yudenich decided to either merge these units under the Russian Caucasus Army or dismantle them.\n\nThe [[Armenian national liberation movement]] commanded the Armenian [[fedayeen|Fedayee]] ({{lang-hy|\u0556\u0567\u057f\u0561\u0575\u056b}} ''F\u0113tayi'') during these conflicts. These civilian forces generally organized around famous leaders, such as [[Murad of Sebastia]] ({{lang-hy|\u054d\u0565\u0562\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0581\u056b \u0544\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0561\u057f}} ''Sebastats'i Murat''). These were generally referred to as Armenian [[Armenian militia|partisan guerrilla detachments]]. [[Boghos Nubar]], the president of the [[Armenian National Assembly]], declared to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] that they accompanied the main Armenian units. The Russian defensive line from Van to [[Erzincan]] was organized through these units.\n\nIn December 1917, The [[Dashnak]]s of the [[Armenian national liberation movement]] through the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians]] established a military force. The corps realigned themselves under the command of General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]]. [[Drastamat Kanayan]] was assigned as a civilian commissioner. The frontline had three main divisions: [[Movses Silikyan]], [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Mikhail Areshian]]. Another regular unit was under Colonel Korganian. The line from Van to [[Erzincan]] was organized through these units. It was mentioned that Adrianic had 150,000 men.<ref name=\"bogus\">[[Boghos Nubar]] the president of the \"[[Armenian National Assembly]]\" declared to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] through a letter to French Foreign Office \u2013 December 3, 1918</ref> After declaration of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] Nazarbekian became the first Commander-in-chief of the whole Armenian state.\n\nBy the beginning of 1918, the Armenian National Army (made up of 17,000 former troops of the Russian army augmented by 4,000 local volunteers) numbered some 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, according to Allen and Muratoff. Contrary to initial Turkish opinion, the Armenian force was actually rather well-equipped and trained. The infantry were made up of veteran soldiers of the Druzhiny units which had fought alongside the Russians for almost four years, and the Armenians were allowed to recover the best of the equipment left behind by the decaying Russian Army. Alternative estimates given by the Ottoman Army state that the Armenian army numbered 50,000 men by the beginning of 1918, while post-war Russian sources put Armenia's strength as two veteran rifle divisions, three brigades of volunteers, and one brigade of cavalry.<ref>Erickson 2001, p. 182\u2013183</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Lionel Dunsterville]] was appointed in 1917 to lead an Allied force of under 1,000 Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand troops, accompanied by armored cars.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Forces engaged at the campaign\" widths=\"100px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Sarikam.jpg|1914, [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] at Sarikamish\nFile:Staff of armenian volunteers 1914.png|1914, Staff of [[Armenian volunteers]]; [[Khetcho]], [[Drastamat Kanayan|Dro]], and [[Karekin Pastermadjian|Armen Garo]]\nFile:Battle Sarikamis winter gear.png|1914, Ottoman 3rd Army with winter gear\nFile:World War I Caucasus Campaign -memory.loc.gov.png|1915, Troops of Kurdish cavalry\n</gallery>\n\n== Operations ==\n\n=== 1914 ===\nOn November 1, in the [[Bergmann Offensive]], Russians crossed the frontier first.

They reached K\u00f6pr\u00fck\u00f6y on November 4. On the left-wing, the Russian IV Corps moved from Yerevan to Pasinler Plains. The commander of 3rd Army, [[Hasan Izzet]] was not in favor of an offensive action in the harsh winter conditions. His plan was to remain in defense and launch a counterattack at the right time. This was overridden by the War Minister Enver Pasha. On November 7, the Turkish 3rd Army commenced its offensive with the participation of the XI Corps and all cavalry units. This force was supported by a Kurdish Tribal Regiment. The cavalry failed to execute the encirclement and the Kurdish Tribal Regiment proved to be unreliable. The Russians gained territory after the withdrawal of the 18th and the 30th Divisions. Ottoman forces managed to maintain their positions at K\u00f6pr\u00fck\u00f6y. By November 12, the Turkish IX Corps with [[Ahmet Fevzi]] Pasha had reinforced the XI Corps on the left flank. The 3rd Army began to push the Russians back with the support of the cavalry. The 3rd Infantry Regiment managed to invade K\u00f6pr\u00fck\u00f6y after the Azap Offensive between November 17 and 20. By the end of November, the front had stabilized, with the Russians clinging to a salient 25 kilometers into the Ottoman Empire along the Erzurum-Sarikamish axis.

This was an operation commanded by the German Lt. Col. Stange. The mission of Stange Bey Detachment was to conduct highly visible operations to distract and pin down Russian units. Stange Bey's initial mission was to operate in the Chorok region. The unit was materially assisted by the rebellious Adjars of the country, who seized the road.

In the face of the 3rd Army's advance, Governor Vorontsov planned to pull the Russian Caucasus Army back to Kars. Yudenich ignored Vorontsov's wish to withdraw. He stayed to defend Sarikamis. Enver Pasha assumed personal command of the 3rd Army and ordered it into battle against the Russian troops.\n\n=== 1915 ===\nOn January 6, the 3rd Army headquarters found itself under fire. [[Hafiz Hakki Pasha]] ordered a total retreat. On January 7, the remaining forces began their march towards Erzurum. The resulting Battle of Sarikamish became a stunning defeat. Only 10% of the Army managed to retreat back to its starting position. After this, Enver gave up command.

Col. Stange's Turkish unit was recalled from the area around Ardahan. It was to stay behind the lines in the region; only on March 1, 1915, did it regain its initial position.\n\nIn February, General Yudenich was praised for the victory and promoted to commander-in-chief of all Russian troops in the Caucasus. The Allies (British and France) asked Russia to relieve the pressure on the Western front. In return, Russia asked the Allies to relieve pressure in the Caucasus by a naval attack. The resulting operations [[Naval warfare of World War I#Black Sea|in the Black Sea]] gave the Russians some respite to replenish their forces. Additionally, actions at the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which aimed at capturing the Ottoman capital helped the Russian forces on this front.<ref name=\"Pollard\" /> On February 12, the commander of the 3rd Army Hafiz Hakki Pasha died of typhus and was replaced by Brigadier General [[Mahmut Kamil]] Pasha. Kamil faced the daunting task of putting the Ottoman army back in order. The military planners back in Istanbul were scared of the Russians advancing deeper into the mainland.\n\nDuring March the strategic situation remained stable.  The completely devastated 3rd Army received new blood through reinforcements from the 1st and 2nd Armies, although these supplements were not stronger than a division. The Battle of Gallipoli was draining every Ottoman resource. Meanwhile, the Russians were holding the towns of Ele\u015fkirt, A\u011fr\u0131 and Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t in the south.

He claimed the defense of Van from Ottoman massacres to be an example. This was the beginning of the [[Armenian Genocide]].\n\nOn May 6, the Russian  advance began through the Tortum Valley towards Erzurum. The Ottoman 29th and 30th Divisions managed to stop this assault. The Ottoman X Corps counter-attacked the Russian forces. But on the southern part of this advance, Ottoman forces were not as successful as they have been in the north. On May 11 the town of [[Manzikert]] had fallen. On May 17, Russian forces entered the town of Van. On May 21, General Yudenich arrived in the city, received the keys to the city and citadel and confirmed the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Armenian provisional government]] in office, with [[Aram Manukian]] as governor. The [[Armenian irregular units|Fedayee]] turned over the city of Van. With Van secure, fighting shifted farther west for the rest of the summer.<ref name=\"caven 2\" /> Ottoman forces continued to be pushed back. The region south of Lake Van was extremely vulnerable. The Turks had to defend a line of more than 600 kilometers with only 50,000 men and 130 pieces of artillery. They were clearly outnumbered by the Russians. The region was mountainous, thus difficult to attack or defend.\n\n[[File:Rafael de Nogales Mendez.png|right|180px|thumb|[[Rafael de Nogales M\u00e9ndez]], a [[Venezuela]]n officer who served in the Ottoman army, participated in the Siege of Van and after the war wrote one of the best accounts of the battle and its aftermath.]]\nOn May 27, during the Russian offensive, the interior minister of Talat Pasha ordered a forced deportation of all Armenians out of region with the [[Tehcir Law]] to the Syria and Mosul.\n\nBy June 13, Russian units were back to their starting line. On June 19, the Russians launched another offensive; this time northwest of Lake Van. The Russians, under Oganovski, launched an attack into the hills west of Manzikert. The Russians underestimated the size of the Ottoman army, and were surprised by a large Turkish force which [[Battle of Manzikert (1915)|counterattacked]]. Russian forces began to march from Manzikert towards Mush. However, they were not aware of the fact that the Turkish IX Corps, together with the 17th and 28th Divisions was moving to Mush as well. Although the conditions were extremely difficult, the Turks were executing a very efficient reorganization. 1st and 5th Expeditionary Forces were positioned to the south of the Russian offensive force and a \"Right Wing Group\" was established under the command of Brigadier General Abd\u00fclkerim Pa\u015fa. This group was independent from the Third Army and Abd\u00fclkerim Pa\u015fa was directly reporting to Enver Pa\u015fa. The Turks were ready to face the Russian attacks.\n\nOn September 24, Grand Duke Nicholas was promoted to being in charge of all Russian forces in the Caucasus. In reality, he was removed from being Supreme Commander of the Russian Caucasus Army which was the highest executive position [actual conduct of the war] for the Caucasus campaign. His replacement was General Yudenich. This front was quiet from October till the end of the year. Yudenich used this period to reorganize. Around the start of 1916, Russian forces reached a level of 200,000 men and 380 pieces of artillery. On the other side the situation was very different; the Ottoman High Command failed to make up the losses during this period. The war in Gallipoli was sucking all the resources and manpower. The IX, X and XI Corps could not be reinforced and in addition to that the 1st and 5th Expeditionary Forces were deployed to Mesopotamia. Enver Pasha, after not achieving his ambitions or recognizing the dire situation on other fronts, decided that the region was of secondary importance. As of January 1916, Ottoman forces were 126,000 men, only 50,539 being combatants. There were 74,057 rifles, 77 machine guns, and 180 pieces of artillery. Ottoman force in Caucasus campaign was big on the paper, but not on the ground. The Ottomans assumed that the Russians would not bother to attack. This assumption turned out to be false.\n\n=== 1916 ===\n[[File:Ataturk-1916-Bitlis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] at Bitlis]]\nIn early January, Yudenich secretly left his winter quarters and marched towards the major Ottoman fort at [[Erzurum]]. The winter is not normally a time for military activity in this part of the world. The bitter cold and terrible roads contributed greatly to the annihilation of Enver Pasha's 3rd Army in the previous year. The Russian General Yudenich viewed this as an opportunity to take the Ottomans by surprise. The Russians achieved total surprise and destroyed an Ottoman division that was in winter quarters in the  [[Battle of Koprukoy]] (January 10\u201318).\n\nOn February 16, Mahmut Kamil was forced to order the 3rd Army to retreat from the city, as Yudenich had a numerical advantage over the Ottoman army. The difference was not big enough to be decisive, so Yudenich's plan was to attack the center of the Ottoman defenses, with the key attack falling in a weakly held sector.  While diversionary attacks held the attention of Mahmut Kamil near the Deve-Boyun ridge, Russian forces broke through at Forts Kara-gobek and Tafet.<ref>{{cite book |first=W. E.

Part went north and captured the ancient port city of [[Trabzon]]. The other part moved in the direction of Mush and Bitlis .These units pushed the 2nd Army deep into Anatolia and defeated the Turks in the Battles of Mush and  [[Battle of Bitlis|Bitlis]] (March 2 \u2013 August 24), driving the Ottoman army before it. Bitlis was the last defence point for the Ottoman Army to prevent the Russians from moving into central Anatolia and Mesopotamia.\n\nDuring July, General Yudenich then countered the Ottoman attack with an offensive of his own towards Erzincan. This was the [[Battle of Erzincan]] (July 2\u201325). On July 2, Erzincan was captured. The Ottoman offensive against Trabzon was halted as they tried to stabilize their front lines to prevent the Russians from entering Anatolia and Mesopotamia.\n[[File:Antranik in Bitlis 1917.jpg|left|thumb|[[Andranik Ozanian]] in Bitlis]]\nAfter their defeat, the Ottoman Army gave [[Mustafa Kemal]] the organization of the defense of the region in August. The region was controlled by the 2nd Army. When Mustafa Kemal was assigned to his post, the enemy forces were in constant advance. Fighting around the east side of Lake Van continued throughout the summer but was inconclusive. In the earlier periods of the campaign, the XVI Corps managed to take Bitlis and Mush. Ahmet \u0130zzet Pa\u015fa decided to attack one week after the conclusion of the Russian offensive. A military force was gathered and sent marching along the coast. The Second Army advanced on August 2. While [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich]] was in the north and pushing the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 3rd Army]], the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 2nd Army]] was in the south facing the insurgency and the second branch of the Russian army under General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] and a [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] of [[Armenian volunteer units]] led by [[Andranik Ozanian]]. After fighting from 1\u20139 August 1916, the Ottoman Army was overwhelmed and the entire region fell to the Russian Empire and Armenian volunteers, and thus an assault on Van was prevented.\n[[File:Western Armenia Russian occupation 1916.jpg|thumb|right|The area of Russian [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|occupation]] of that region in summer 1916 (Russian map).]]\n\nBy the late September, the Ottoman attack ended. The cost for the 2nd Army was 30,000 killed and wounded. The Russians strengthened their lines. They were strong enough to respond with counteroffensives in two weeks after the launch of the Ottoman offensive. The Russians held up the advance.\n\nFrom September towards the Russian Revolution, the Russian Navy still dominated the Black Sea.\n\nThe rest of the year 1916 was spent by the Turks making organizational and operational changes in the Caucasian front. Fortunately for the Ottoman commanders, the Russians were quiet during this period. The winter of 1916\u201317 was extremely harsh, which made fighting nearly impossible.\n\n=== 1917 ===\n[[File:Western Armenia September 1917.png|thumb|right|[[Western Armenia]] territory under Russian control as of September 1917]]\n\nThe military situation did not change during the spring of 1917. The Russian plans for a renewed attack never substantiated. Meanwhile, Russia was in political and social turmoil. It was also influencing the army ranks. The chaos caused by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] put a stop to all Russian military operations. The Russian forces began to conduct withdrawals. Neither the Russian soldiers nor the Russian people wanted to continue the war. The Russian army slowly disintegrated. Starting from the spring of 1917, the situation was completely disadvantageous as a renewed typhus, scurvy and similar problems resulting from hygiene and food, became very common in the Caucasian army.<ref>{{cite book |last=Serge |first=Victor |title=Year One of The Russian Revolution |location=Chicago |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1972 |isbn=0-7139-0135-7 |page=193 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Ottoman Empire's possible operation in Caucasia could not be imagined. After the [[Battle of Sarikamish]], the Ottoman units were \"almost always\" in a disastrous situation trying to hold onto regions in the occupied Ottoman lands. The Ottoman forces could not take advantage of the chaotic situation during 1917, as their units were not in good shape. [[Enver Pasha|Enver]] moved five divisions out of the region because of the pressure from the British in Palestine and Mesopotamia.\n\nOn March 1, the order \"Number\u20131\" published by Petrograd Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies included paragraphs envisioning democratization of the army. This written command enabled military units to elect their representatives. On March 9, 1917, [[Special Transcaucasian Committee|a Special Transcaucasian Committee]] was established with Member of the State Duma [[V. A. Kharlamov]] as the Chairman to replace the Imperial Viceroy [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)]] by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] as the highest organ of civil administrative body in Transcaucasia. The new government reassigned General Yudenich to a position in Central Asia. General Yudenich retired from the army following the assignment.\n\nDuring the summer, during the [[occupation of Turkish Armenia]] the Russians sponsored a conference to consider emergency measures and adopted plans to form a twenty-thousand-man militia under [[Andranik Ozanian|Andranik]] to be ready in December 1917. Civilian commissioner Dr. Hakob Zavriev promoted [[Andranik Ozanian|Andranik]] to Major General. The 1st brigade of Andranik's division was composed of the [[Erzincan|Erzinjan]] and [[Erzurum]] regiments. The 2nd brigade was composed of the [[H\u0131n\u0131s|Khnus]] and [[Ele\u015fkirt|Alashkert]] regiments. The 3rd brigade was of the [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and mounted [[S\u00fcleymanl\u0131|Zeytoun]] regiments.\n\n[[File:Armenianmothermourning.jpg|left|thumb|An Armenian mother beside the corpses of her five children]]\nOn September 14, 1917, the Russian army in the region, which was about to completely disintegrate, lost commanding authority, and the tendency of the villagers for plundering had increased. Towards the end of autumn, the Chief General of the Caucasus Front Przhevalskii had already ordered the establishment of national Armenian and Georgian forces within the Army to slow down the disintegration. The problems of demobilization of Russian Army (on all fronts Russians had the same problems) would in a way bring the end of the Russian government and help the Bolsheviks to come into power easily. In November 1917, the first government of the independent Transcaucasia was created in Tbilisi as the \"Transcaucasian Commissariat ([[Transcaucasian Sejm]])\" replaced \"Transcaucasian Committee\" following the Bolshevik seizure of power in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Transcaucasian Sejm was headed by a Georgian Menshevik, [[Nikolay Chkheidze]]. But the Transcaucasian Sejm did not stop the degradation of forces in the region into smaller national forces. While Armenians sent representatives to the Transcaucasian Sejm, at the same time the Eastern Armenian leaders at [[Yerevan|Erivan]] tried to established an Armenian Army Corps. Armenians had planned to keep their existence based on a political strategy of being supportive of the Allies and Russia and to establish their national army with Russian support.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

The Chief of Staff of the Armenian Corps was General Vickinski. The divisions, which comprised four regiments each, had also three regular and one depot regiment. Their total strength was 32,000 enlisted men. Besides these regular structures able men were also armed. A 40 to 50,000-strong force formed from this armed civilian population.

The ethnic cleansings and massacres resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians, with other estimates being between 800,000 and 1,800,000, the destruction of thousands of years of Armenian heritage in the form of monasteries, churches, cemeteries, houses, schools, and other buildings, a massive expansion of the Armenian diaspora in countries like [[French Armenians|France]] and the [[Armenian Americans|United States]], and the continuous 100-year long contention between the modern day states of [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Tsitsernakaberd Memorial Complex| url= http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/Description_and_history.php | publisher = [[Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Forsythe2009\">{{cite book | first = David P. |last=Forsythe | title = Encyclopedia of human rights | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&pg=PA98 | date= 11 August 2009| format = Google Books | publisher= Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-533402-9 | page = 98}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:ApproxPositionsWWI-1919.png|thumb|200px|Place of [[Dunsterforce]] forces after Armistice]]\n{{Main|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\nThe Ottoman Empire lost the war to the Allies, but the borders in the Caucasus were not settled.

[[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]] engaged in the [[Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918\u20131920)]] over Karabakh and Nakhichevan, with Armenia losing both due to Soviet intervention in favor of the anti west [[Turkish National Movement]].

In the west, there was a war over Karbakh with Armenia; in the east, the local Azeri communists were rebelling against the government; and to the north the Russian Red Army was steadily moving southward having defeated Denikin's White Russian forces. ADR officially surrendered to the Soviets, but many generals and local Azeri militias kept resisting the advance of the Soviet forces and it took a while for the Soviets to stabilize the newly proclaimed [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. On December 4, 1920, the government of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] effectively surrendered. On December 5, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom) made up of mostly Armenians from mountainous Karabakh entered the city. On December 6, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s dreaded secret police, [[Cheka]] entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending all existence of the ADR.<ref name=\"Hewsen-237\">{{cite book |first=Robert H. |last=Hewsen |title=Armenia: A Historical Atlas |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |page=237 |isbn=0-226-33228-4 }}</ref> The [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was proclaimed, under the leadership of Aleksandr Miasnikyan.

The Caucasus campaign extended from the [[South Caucasus]] to the [[Armenian Highlands]] region, reaching as far as [[Trabzon]], [[Bitlis]], [[Mu\u015f|Mush]] and [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. The land warfare was accompanied by the Russian navy in the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea Region]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nOn February 23, 1917, the Russian advance was halted following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], and later the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] disintegrated and was replaced by the forces of the newly established Armenian state, comprising [[Armenian volunteer units]] and [[Armenian irregular units|irregular units]] which had previously been part of the Russian Army. During 1918 the region also saw the establishment of the Central Caspian Dictatorship, the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] and an Allied intervention force, nicknamed [[Dunsterforce]], composed of troops drawn from the Mesopotamian and Western Fronts. The Ottoman Empire and the [[German Empire]] had a hot conflict at Batumi with the arrival of the [[German Caucasus Expedition]] whose prime aim was to secure oil supplies.\n\nOn March 3, 1918, the campaign terminated between the Ottoman Empire and Russia with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and on June 4, 1918, the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Treaty of Batum]] with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. However, the armed conflicts continued as Ottoman Empire was still engaged with the Central Caspian Dictatorship, Republic of Mountainous Armenia and Dunsterforce of the British Empire until the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on October 30, 1918.\n\nThe [[Armenian Genocide]] was carried out during the course of the campaign.\n\n== Background ==\nThe main objective of the Ottoman Empire was the recovery of territory in the [[Caucasus]], including regions captured by the Russian empire as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u201378]]. The strategic goals of the Caucasus campaign for Ottoman forces was to retake [[Artvin]], [[Ardahan]], [[Kars]], and the port of [[Batum]].

In March 1915 the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] foreign minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] stated in a meeting with [[British Empire|British]] ambassador [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|George Buchanan]] and French Ambassador [[Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue]] that a lasting postwar settlement demanded full Russian possession of Constantinople (the capital city of the Ottoman Empire), the straits of [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], southern [[Thrace]] up to the Enos-Midia line as well as parts of the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea coast]] of Anatolia between the Bosphorus, the [[Sakarya River]] and an undetermined point near the Bay of [[Izmit]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald Park |last=Bobroff |title=Roads to glory \u2013 Late Imperial Russia and the Turkish Straits |location=London |publisher=I.B.

In 1916 they sent reinforcements and formed the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|2nd Army]].  At the beginning of the conflict, the combined forces of the Ottomans ranged from 100,000 to 190,000 men. Many were poorly equipped.\n\n=== Russia ===\nBefore the war, Russia had the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] stationed here, with 100,000 men under the nominal command of the Governor-General of the Caucasus [[Vorontsov|Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov]]. The real commander was his chief of staff General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Nikolai Yudenich]].

However, This Army had lots of Armenian support.  It had Armenian generals [[Tovmas Nazarbekian|Nazarbekov]], [[Movses Silikyan|Silikian]], and Pirumov who stayed in Caucasia.

It was initially established as detachment units (rather than part of Russian Caucasus Command) under the Viceroyalty of the Caucasus. These forces were commanded by [[Andranik Ozanian]]. Other leaders included [[Drastamat Kanayan]], [[Hamazasp Srvandztyan]], [[Arshak Gafavian]], and [[Sargis Mehrabyan]]. An Ottoman representative [[Karekin Bastermadjian]] (Armen Karo) was also united to this force. Initially, they had 20,000 men, but throughout the conflicts, it was reported that their number increased. At the turn of 1916, Nikolai Yudenich decided to either merge these units under the Russian Caucasus Army or dismantle them.\n\nThe [[Armenian national liberation movement]] commanded the Armenian [[fedayeen|Fedayee]] ({{lang-hy|\u0556\u0567\u057f\u0561\u0575\u056b}} ''F\u0113tayi'') during these conflicts.

The Russian defensive line from Van to [[Erzincan]] was organized through these units.\n\nIn December 1917, The [[Dashnak]]s of the [[Armenian national liberation movement]] through the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians]] established a military force. The corps realigned themselves under the command of General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]]. [[Drastamat Kanayan]] was assigned as a civilian commissioner. The frontline had three main divisions: [[Movses Silikyan]], [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Mikhail Areshian]]. Another regular unit was under Colonel Korganian. The line from Van to [[Erzincan]] was organized through these units.

Contrary to initial Turkish opinion, the Armenian force was actually rather well-equipped and trained. The infantry were made up of veteran soldiers of the Druzhiny units which had fought alongside the Russians for almost four years, and the Armenians were allowed to recover the best of the equipment left behind by the decaying Russian Army. Alternative estimates given by the Ottoman Army state that the Armenian army numbered 50,000 men by the beginning of 1918, while post-war Russian sources put Armenia's strength as two veteran rifle divisions, three brigades of volunteers, and one brigade of cavalry.<ref>Erickson 2001, p. 182-183</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Lionel Dunsterville]] was appointed in 1917 to lead an Allied force of under 1,000 Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand troops, accompanied by armored cars.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Forces engaged at the campaign\" widths=\"100px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Sarikam.jpg|1914, [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] at Sarikamish\nFile:Staff of armenian volunteers 1914.png|1914, Staff of [[Armenian volunteers]]; [[Khetcho]], [[Drastamat Kanayan|Dro]], and [[Karekin Pastermadjian|Armen Garo]]\nFile:Battle Sarikamis winter gear.png|1914, Ottoman 3rd Army with winter gear\nFile:World War I Caucasus Campaign -memory.loc.gov.png|1915, Troops of Kurdish cavalry\n</gallery>\n\n== Operations ==\n\n=== 1914 ===\nOn November 1, in the [[Bergmann Offensive]], Russians crossed the frontier first.

They reached K\u00f6pr\u00fck\u00f6y on November 4. On the left-wing, the Russian IV Corps moved from Yerevan to Pasinler Plains. The commander of 3rd Army, [[Hasan Izzet]] was not in favor of an offensive action in the harsh winter conditions. His plan was to remain in defense and launch a counterattack at the right time. This was overridden by the War Minister Enver Pasha. On November 7, the Turkish 3rd Army commenced its offensive with the participation of the XI Corps and all cavalry units. This force was supported by a Kurdish Tribal Regiment. The cavalry failed to execute the encirclement and the Kurdish Tribal Regiment proved to be unreliable. The Russians gained territory after the withdrawal of the 18th and the 30th Divisions. Ottoman forces managed to maintain their positions at K\u00f6pr\u00fck\u00f6y. By November 12, the Turkish IX Corps with [[Ahmet Fevzi]] Pasha had reinforced the XI Corps on the left flank. The 3rd Army began to push the Russians back with the support of the cavalry. The 3rd Infantry Regiment managed to invade K\u00f6pr\u00fck\u00f6y after the Azap Offensive between November 17 and 20. By the end of November, the front had stabilized, with the Russians clinging to a salient 25 kilometers into the Ottoman Empire along the Erzurum-Sarikamish axis.

This was an operation commanded by the German Lt. Col. Stange. The mission of Stange Bey Detachment was to conduct highly visible operations to distract and pin down Russian units. Stange Bey's initial mission was to operate in the Chorok region. The unit was materially assisted by the rebellious Adjars of the country, who seized the road. Later Enver modified the original plan toward supporting the Battle of Sarikamish.<ref>{{cite book |first=Spencer |last=Tucker |title=The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Garland |year=1996 |isbn=0-8153-0399-8 |page=174 }}</ref> Stange Bey Detachment was ordered to cut the Russian support link to Sarikamish-Kars line.

In the face of the 3rd Army's advance, Governor Vorontsov planned to pull the Russian Caucasus Army back to Kars. Yudenich ignored Vorontsov's wish to withdraw. He stayed to defend Sarikamis. Enver Pasha assumed personal command of the 3rd Army and ordered it into battle against the Russian troops.\n\n=== 1915 ===\nOn January 6, the 3rd Army headquarters found itself under fire. [[Hafiz Hakki Pasha]] ordered a total retreat. On January 7, the remaining forces began their march towards Erzurum. The resulting Battle of Sarikamish became a stunning defeat. Only 10% of the Army managed to retreat back to its starting position. After this, Enver gave up command.

Col. Stange's Turkish unit was recalled from the area around Ardahan. It was to stay behind the lines in the region; only on March 1, 1915, did it regain its initial position.\n\nIn February, General Yudenich was praised for the victory and promoted to commander-in-chief of all Russian troops in the Caucasus. The Allies (British and France) asked Russia to relieve the pressure on the Western front. In return, Russia asked the Allies to relieve pressure in the Caucasus by a naval attack. The resulting operations [[Naval warfare of World War I#Black Sea|in the Black Sea]] gave the Russians some respite to replenish their forces. Additionally, actions at the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which aimed at capturing the Ottoman capital helped the Russian forces on this front.<ref name=\"Pollard\" /> On February 12, the commander of the 3rd Army Hafiz Hakki Pasha died of typhus and was replaced by Brigadier General [[Mahmut Kamil]] Pasha. Kamil faced the daunting task of putting the Ottoman army back in order. The military planners back in Istanbul were scared of the Russians advancing deeper into the mainland.\n\nDuring March the strategic situation remained stable.  The completely devastated 3rd Army received new blood through reinforcements from the 1st and 2nd Armies, although these supplements were not stronger than a division. The Battle of Gallipoli was draining every Ottoman resource. Meanwhile, the Russians were holding the towns of Ele\u015fkirt, A\u011fr\u0131 and Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t in the south. Military action never escalated above small-scale skirmishes\u2014the Ottomans simply did not have enough forces to secure the whole East Anatolian region.\n\n[[File:Van Defenders.jpg|thumb|left|[[Defense of Van (1915)|Siege of Van]], Armenian troops holding a defense line against Ottoman forces in the walled city of Van in May 1915]]\n\nOn April 20, the [[Defense of Van (1915)|resistance at the city of Van]] began.

He claimed the defense of Van from Ottoman massacres to be an example. This was the beginning of the [[Armenian Genocide]].\n\nOn May 6, the Russian  advance began through the Tortum Valley towards Erzurum. The Ottoman 29th and 30th Divisions managed to stop this assault. The Ottoman X Corps counter-attacked the Russian forces. But on the southern part of this advance, Ottoman forces were not as successful as they have been in the north. On May 11 the town of [[Manzikert]] had fallen. On May 17, Russian forces entered the town of Van. On May 21, General Yudenich arrived in the city, received the keys to the city and citadel and confirmed the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Armenian provisional government]] in office, with [[Aram Manukian]] as governor. The [[Armenian irregular units|Fedayee]] turned over the city of Van. With Van secure, fighting shifted farther west for the rest of the summer.<ref name=\"caven 2\" /> Ottoman forces continued to be pushed back. The region south of Lake Van was extremely vulnerable. The Turks had to defend a line of more than 600 kilometers with only 50,000 men and 130 pieces of artillery. They were clearly outnumbered by the Russians. The region was mountainous, thus difficult to attack or defend.\n\n[[File:Rafael de Nogales Mendez.png|right|180px|thumb|[[Rafael de Nogales M\u00e9ndez]], a [[Venezuela]]n officer who served in the Ottoman army, participated in the Siege of Van and after the war wrote one of the best accounts of the battle and its aftermath.]]\nOn May 27, during the Russian offensive, the interior minister of Talat Pasha ordered a forced deportation of all Armenians out of region with the [[Tehcir Law]] to the Syria and Mosul.\n\nBy June 13, Russian units were back to their starting line. On June 19, the Russians launched another offensive; this time northwest of Lake Van. The Russians, under Oganovski, launched an attack into the hills west of Manzikert. The Russians underestimated the size of the Ottoman army, and were surprised by a large Turkish force which [[Battle of Manzikert (1915)|counterattacked]]. Russian forces began to march from Manzikert towards Mush. However, they were not aware of the fact that the Turkish IX Corps, together with the 17th and 28th Divisions was moving to Mush as well. Although the conditions were extremely difficult, the Turks were executing a very efficient reorganization. 1st and 5th Expeditionary Forces were positioned to the south of the Russian offensive force and a \"Right Wing Group\" was established under the command of Brigadier General Abd\u00fclkerim Pa\u015fa. This group was independent from the Third Army and Abd\u00fclkerim Pa\u015fa was directly reporting to Enver Pa\u015fa. The Turks were ready to face the Russian attacks.\n\nOn September 24, Grand Duke Nicholas was promoted to being in charge of all Russian forces in the Caucasus. In reality, he was removed from being Supreme Commander of the Russian Caucasus Army which was the highest executive position [actual conduct of the war] for the Caucasus campaign. His replacement was General Yudenich. This front was quiet from October till the end of the year. Yudenich used this period to reorganize. Around the start of 1916, Russian forces reached a level of 200,000 men and 380 pieces of artillery. On the other side the situation was very different; the Ottoman High Command failed to make up the losses during this period. The war in Gallipoli was sucking all the resources and manpower. The IX, X and XI Corps could not be reinforced and in addition to that the 1st and 5th Expeditionary Forces were deployed to Mesopotamia. Enver Pasha, after not achieving his ambitions or recognizing the dire situation on other fronts, decided that the region was of secondary importance. As of January 1916, Ottoman forces were 126,000 men, only 50,539 being combatants. There were 74,057 rifles, 77 machine guns, and 180 pieces of artillery. Ottoman force in Caucasus campaign was big on the paper, but not on the ground. The Ottomans assumed that the Russians would not bother to attack. This assumption turned out to be false.\n\n=== 1916 ===\n[[File:Ataturk-1916-Bitlis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] at Bitlis]]\nIn early January, Yudenich secretly left his winter quarters and marched towards the major Ottoman fort at [[Erzurum]]. The winter is not normally a time for military activity in this part of the world. The bitter cold and terrible roads contributed greatly to the annihilation of Enver Pasha's 3rd Army in the previous year. The Russian General Yudenich viewed this as an opportunity to take the Ottomans by surprise. The Russians achieved total surprise and destroyed an Ottoman division that was in winter quarters in the  [[Battle of Koprukoy]] (January 10\u201318).\n\nOn February 16, Mahmut Kamil was forced to order the 3rd Army to retreat from the city, as Yudenich had a numerical advantage over the Ottoman army. The difference was not big enough to be decisive, so Yudenich's plan was to attack the center of the Ottoman defenses, with the key attack falling in a weakly held sector.  While diversionary attacks held the attention of Mahmut Kamil near the Deve-Boyun ridge, Russian forces broke through at Forts Kara-gobek and Tafet.<ref>{{cite book |first=W. E.

Part went north and captured the ancient port city of [[Trabzon]]. The other part moved in the direction of Mush and Bitlis .These units pushed the 2nd Army deep into Anatolia and defeated the Turks in the Battles of Mush and  [[Battle of Bitlis|Bitlis]] (March 2 \u2013 August 24), driving the Ottoman army before it. Bitlis was the last defence point for the Ottoman Army to prevent the Russians from moving into central Anatolia and Mesopotamia.\n\nDuring July, General Yudenich then countered the Ottoman attack with an offensive of his own towards Erzincan. This was the [[Battle of Erzincan]] (July 2\u201325). On July 2, Erzincan was captured. The Ottoman offensive against Trabzon was halted as they tried to stabilize their front lines to prevent the Russians from entering Anatolia and Mesopotamia.\n[[File:Antranik in Bitlis 1917.jpg|left|thumb|[[Andranik Ozanian]] in Bitlis]]\nAfter their defeat, the Ottoman Army gave [[Mustafa Kemal]] the organization of the defense of the region in August. The region was controlled by the 2nd Army. When Mustafa Kemal was assigned to his post, the enemy forces were in constant advance. Fighting around the east side of Lake Van continued throughout the summer but was inconclusive. In the earlier periods of the campaign, the XVI Corps managed to take Bitlis and Mush. Ahmet \u0130zzet Pa\u015fa decided to attack one week after the conclusion of the Russian offensive. A military force was gathered and sent marching along the coast. The Second Army advanced on August 2. While [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich]] was in the north and pushing the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 3rd Army]], the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 2nd Army]] was in the south facing the insurgency and the second branch of the Russian army under General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] and a [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] of [[Armenian volunteer units]] led by [[Andranik Ozanian]]. After fighting from 1\u20139 August 1916, the Ottoman Army was overwhelmed and the entire region fell to the Russian Empire and Armenian volunteers, and thus an assault on Van was prevented.\n[[File:Western Armenia Russian occupation 1916.jpg|thumb|right|The area of Russian [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|occupation]] of that region in summer 1916 (Russian map).]]\n\nBy the late September, the Ottoman attack ended. The cost for the 2nd Army was 30,000 killed and wounded. The Russians strengthened their lines. They were strong enough to respond with counteroffensives in two weeks after the launch of the Ottoman offensive. The Russians held up the advance.\n\nFrom September towards the Russian Revolution, the Russian Navy still dominated the Black Sea.\n\nThe rest of the year 1916 was spent by the Turks making organizational and operational changes in the Caucasian front. Fortunately for the Ottoman commanders, the Russians were quiet during this period. The winter of 1916\u201317 was extremely harsh, which made fighting nearly impossible.\n\n=== 1917 ===\n[[File:Western Armenia September 1917.png|thumb|right|[[Western Armenia]] territory under Russian control as of September 1917]]\n\nThe military situation did not change during the spring of 1917. The Russian plans for a renewed attack never substantiated. Meanwhile, Russia was in political and social turmoil. It was also influencing the army ranks. The chaos caused by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] put a stop to all Russian military operations. The Russian forces began to conduct withdrawals. Neither the Russian soldiers nor the Russian people wanted to continue the war. The Russian army slowly disintegrated. Starting from the spring of 1917, the situation was completely disadvantageous as a renewed typhus, scurvy and similar problems resulting from hygiene and food, became very common in the Caucasian army.<ref>{{cite book |last=Serge |first=Victor |title=Year One of The Russian Revolution |location=Chicago |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1972 |isbn=0-7139-0135-7 |page=193 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Ottoman Empire's possible operation in Caucasia could not be imagined. After the [[Battle of Sarikamish]], the Ottoman units were \"almost always\" in a disastrous situation trying to hold onto regions in the occupied Ottoman lands. The Ottoman forces could not take advantage of the chaotic situation during 1917, as their units were not in good shape. [[Enver Pasha|Enver]] moved five divisions out of the region because of the pressure from the British in Palestine and Mesopotamia.\n\nOn March 1, the order \"Number\u20131\" published by Petrograd Soviet of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies included paragraphs envisioning democratization of the army. This written command enabled military units to elect their representatives. On March 9, 1917, [[Special Transcaucasian Committee|a Special Transcaucasian Committee]] was established with Member of the State Duma [[V. A. Kharlamov]] as the Chairman to replace the Imperial Viceroy [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)]] by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] as the highest organ of civil administrative body in Transcaucasia. The new government reassigned General Yudenich to a position in Central Asia. General Yudenich retired from the army following the assignment.\n\nDuring the summer, during the [[occupation of Turkish Armenia]] the Russians sponsored a conference to consider emergency measures and adopted plans to form a twenty-thousand-man militia under [[Andranik Ozanian|Andranik]] to be ready in December 1917. Civilian commissioner Dr. Hakob Zavriev promoted [[Andranik Ozanian|Andranik]] to Major General. The 1st brigade of Andranik's division was composed of the [[Erzincan|Erzinjan]] and [[Erzurum]] regiments. The 2nd brigade was composed of the [[H\u0131n\u0131s|Khnus]] and [[Ele\u015fkirt|Alashkert]] regiments. The 3rd brigade was of the [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and mounted [[S\u00fcleymanl\u0131|Zeytoun]] regiments.\n\n[[File:Armenianmothermourning.jpg|left|thumb|An Armenian mother beside the corpses of her five children]]\nOn September 14, 1917, the Russian army in the region, which was about to completely disintegrate, lost commanding authority, and the tendency of the villagers for plundering had increased. Towards the end of autumn, the Chief General of the Caucasus Front Przhevalskii had already ordered the establishment of national Armenian and Georgian forces within the Army to slow down the disintegration. The problems of demobilization of Russian Army (on all fronts Russians had the same problems) would in a way bring the end of the Russian government and help the Bolsheviks to come into power easily. In November 1917, the first government of the independent Transcaucasia was created in Tbilisi as the \"Transcaucasian Commissariat ([[Transcaucasian Sejm]])\" replaced \"Transcaucasian Committee\" following the Bolshevik seizure of power in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Transcaucasian Sejm was headed by a Georgian Menshevik, [[Nikolay Chkheidze]]. But the Transcaucasian Sejm did not stop the degradation of forces in the region into smaller national forces. While Armenians sent representatives to the Transcaucasian Sejm, at the same time the Eastern Armenian leaders at [[Yerevan|Erivan]] tried to established an Armenian Army Corps. Armenians had planned to keep their existence based on a political strategy of being supportive of the Allies and Russia and to establish their national army with Russian support.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

The Chief of Staff of the Armenian Corps was General Vickinski. The divisions, which comprised four regiments each, had also three regular and one depot regiment. Their total strength was 32,000 enlisted men. Besides these regular structures able men were also armed. A 40 to 50,000-strong force formed from this armed civilian population.

The fortress had been strengthened considerably by the Russians since its capture in 1877, and the garrison was strong and well-stocked. The garrison numbered some 10,000 men, and they had at their disposal 154 fixed artillery pieces, 67 reserve artillery pieces, 46 fortress machine guns, 20 reserve machine guns, and 11,000 rifles.<ref>Erickson 2001, p. 185</ref>\n\n[[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] foreign minister [[Akaki Chkhenkeli]] had previously ordered the city to surrender at first contact with the Ottomans, doing so without the notice of the Armenian members of his coalition government; while not followed, the order threw the defenders into confusion and partly caused the exodus of thousands of civilians before and during the siege. Independent of this, it was clear to all involved that the Armenians, surrounded, outnumbered, and cut off from relief, could not hold the city indefinitely. As a result, the garrison scrambled for a way to negotiate their way out without having to fight for the city. The Ottomans agreed to let the garrison peacefully exit the city, but only if they would surrender the entire fortress and its armory intact. General Nazarbekov, the Armenian Corps Commander based in Yerevan acting through a French intermediary, agreed to the surrender of the city and its garrison on April 25, 1918. At the same time the batteries surrounding the city were occupied and in the evening a regiment from the Ottoman I Caucasian Corps entered into the city and took it under control. The Ottomans obtained 11,000 rifles, 2 million bullets, 67 cannons, and 19 machine guns from the surrender.<ref>Richard G. Hovannisian. The Republic of Armenia: The first year, 1918\u20131919.

The Armenian and Georgian members of the Republic's delegation stalled. The Ottoman army moved  once again  on May 21, leading to the [[Battle of Sardarapat]] (May 21\u201329), the [[Battle of Kara Killisse (1918)]] (May 24\u201328), and the [[Battle of Bash Abaran]] (May 21\u201324). Although the Armenians managed to inflict a defeat on the Ottomans, the Armenian army was scattered. Meanwhile, there was a fruitless German-mediated peace conference between the Ottoman and Transcaucasian governments at Batumi, which closed  on May 24, 1918. Two days later, Georgia withdrew from the federation and declared itself a separate republic, encouraged by the German mission led by [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]] and [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]]: the independent [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] was proclaimed, formalized by the [[treaty of Poti]], which Ottoman expansion. {{clarify|date=August 2017}}On the same day the [[First Republic of Armenia]] declared its independence, followed by the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]].\n\nOn June 4, the [[First Republic of Armenia]] was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Batum]].

On June 10, the 3rd Army attacked and took many prisoners, leading to an official threat from Berlin to withdraw all of its troops and support from Ottoman Empire.

The conflict was fierce, but indecisive. The [[Armenian militia]] under Andranik's command decimated an Ottoman unit trying to advance to the [[Varanda River]]. The armed conflicts between these units continued until the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on October 30. By then the Ottomans had re-captured all the territory which they lost to the Russians in [[Eastern Anatolia]].

Disease deaths overwhelmingly outnumbered combat deaths for Ottoman forces however, with over twice as many Ottoman troops dying of disease in the war than combat. Assuming the same trend held true in the Caucasus, Ottoman disease deaths would number ~ 170,000, and total deaths would number ~253,000. Additionally, total woundings were x2.5 greater than critical ones overall. If this average also held true in the Caucasus, total wounded would number 284,000.<ref>Erickson 2001, p. 241</ref> Altogether, total Ottoman losses would be around 576,000 (284,000 dead, 253,000 wounded, 39,000 prisoners), over a third of total Ottoman casualties in World War I.\n\nHistorian [[U\u011fur \u00dcmit \u00dcng\u00f6r]], the author of ''Confiscation and Destruction: The Young Turk Seizure of Armenian Property'', noted that during the Russian invasion of the Ottoman Empire, many atrocities were carried out against the local Turks and Kurds by the Russian army and its Armenian volunteer units.<ref name=john>{{cite book|last=Horne|first=John|title=War in Peace|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-968605-6|pages=173\u2013177}}</ref> A large part of the local Muslim Turks and Kurds fled west after the Russian invasion of 1916.<ref name=mark>{{cite book|last=Levene|first=Mark|title=Devastation|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-150554-6|pages=217, 218| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRgbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA217&dq=immediate+consequence+was+a+range+of+Armenian+atrocities+against+Muslims:+the+massacres+in+Erzinjan+and+Erzurum+from+late+...+close+to+10,000+estimated+to+have+been+butchered+in+the+two+cities%E2%80%94being+notable+for+their+scale+and+ugliness&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=cT8gU_CwJIm-0QX3vICoDQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=immediate%20consequence%20was%20a%20range%20of%20Armenian%20atrocities%20against%20Muslims%3A%20the%20massacres%20in%20Erzinjan%20and%20Erzurum%20from%20late%20...%20close%20to%2010%2C000%20estimated%20to%20have%20been%20butchered%20in%20the%20two%20cities%E2%80%94being%20notable%20for%20their%20scale%20and%20ugliness&f=false}}</ref>\n\n== Armenian Genocide ==\nDuring the Caucasus campaign, [[Ottoman Armenia]] was depopulated of much of the entire Christian [[Armenians|Armenian]] population as part of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. The Armenian population was either forced on long death marches to [[Deir ez-Zor Camps|camps in the middle of the Syrian desert]] to die of disease, abuse by guards, massacres, Kurdish raids along the way, and starvation or, if they refused, be indiscriminately massacred. Both scenarios accomplished the goal of the Ottoman Turks, removal of Armenians from their homelands to continue their occupation of [[Western Armenia]]. The ethnic cleansings and massacres resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians, with other estimates being between 800,000 and 1,800,000, the destruction of thousands of years of Armenian heritage in the form of monasteries, churches, cemeteries, houses, schools, and other buildings, a massive expansion of the Armenian diaspora in countries like [[French Armenians|France]] and the [[Armenian Americans|United States]], and the continuous 100-year long contention between the modern day states of [[Turkey]] and [[Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Tsitsernakaberd Memorial Complex| url= http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/Description_and_history.php | publisher = [[Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Forsythe2009\">{{cite book | first = David P. |last=Forsythe | title = Encyclopedia of human rights | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&pg=PA98 | date= 11 August 2009| format = Google Books | publisher= Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-533402-9 | page = 98}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:ApproxPositionsWWI-1919.png|thumb|200px|Place of [[Dunsterforce]] forces after Armistice]]\n{{Main|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\nThe Ottoman Empire lost the war to the Allies, but the borders in the Caucasus were not settled.

[[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]] engaged in the [[Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918\u20131920)]] over Karabakh and Nakhichevan, with Armenia losing both due to Soviet intervention in favor of the anti west [[Turkish National Movement]].

In the west, there was a war over Karbakh with Armenia; in the east, the local Azeri communists were rebelling against the government; and to the north the Russian Red Army was steadily moving southward having defeated Denikin's White Russian forces. ADR officially surrendered to the Soviets, but many generals and local Azeri militias kept resisting the advance of the Soviet forces and it took a while for the Soviets to stabilize the newly proclaimed [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. On December 4, 1920, the government of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] effectively surrendered. On December 5, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom) made up of mostly Armenians from mountainous Karabakh entered the city.
