He has been generally so regarded ever since, despite evidence of some earlier Christian presence in Ireland.\n\nAccording to the autobiographical ''Confessio'' of Patrick, when he was about sixteen, he was captured by Irish pirates from his home in Britain and taken as a [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slave]] to Ireland, looking after animals; he lived there for six years before escaping and returning to his family. After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland. In later life, he served as a bishop, but little is known about the places where he worked. By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.\n\n[[Saint Patrick's Day]] is observed on 17 March, the supposed date of his death.

In the dioceses of Ireland, it is both a [[solemnity]] and a [[holy day of obligation]]; it is also a celebration of Ireland itself.\n\n==Sources==\nTwo [[Latin]] works survive which are generally accepted as having been written by St. Patrick.

[[T\u00edrech\u00e1n]]'s seventh-century ''Collectanea'' gives: \"Magonus, that is, famous; Succetus, that is, god of war; Patricius, that is, father of the citizens; Cothirthiacus, because he served four houses of druids.\"<ref name=Dumville90>{{harvnb|Dumville|1993|p=90}}</ref> \"Magonus\" appears in the ninth century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' as ''Maun'', descending from British ''*Magunos'', meaning \"servant-lad\".<ref name=Dumville90 /> \"Succetus\", which also appears in [[Muirch\u00fa moccu Machtheni]]'s seventh century ''Life'' as ''Sochet'',<ref name=Dumville90 /> is identified by Mac Neill as \"a word of British origin meaning swineherd\".<ref name=EMN>Eoin Mac Neill, ''St. Patrick'', Clonmore and Reynolds, 1964, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Cothirthiacus also appears as ''Cothraige'' in the 8th century biographical poem known as ''Fiacc's Hymn'' and a variety of other spellings elsewhere, and is taken to represent a [[Primitive Irish]] ''*Qatrikias'', although this is disputed. Harvey argues that ''Cothraige'' \"has the form of a classic Old Irish tribal (and therefore place-) name\", noting that ''Ail Coithrigi'' is a name for the [[Rock of Cashel]], and the place-names ''Cothrugu'' and ''Catrige'' are attested in Counties [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Carlow|Carlow]].<ref>Anthony Harvey, \"The Significance of ''Cothraige''\", ''[[\u00c9riu (journal)|\u00c9riu]]'' Vol. 36, 1985, pp. 1\u20139</ref>\n\n===Dating===\n[[File:Gravestone of St. Patrick, Downpatrick 2018-07-25.jpg|thumb|The reputed burial place of Saint Patrick in [[Downpatrick]]]]\nThe dates of Patrick's life are uncertain; there are conflicting traditions regarding the year of his death. His own writings provide no evidence for any dating more precise than the 5th century generally. His Biblical quotations are a mixture of the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] version and the [[Vulgate]], completed in the early 5th century, suggesting he was writing \"at the point of transition from Old Latin to Vulgate\",<ref>{{harvnb|Dumville|1993|p=16}}</ref> although it is possible the Vulgate readings may have been added later, replacing earlier readings.<ref>See {{harvnb|Flechner|2011|pp=125\u201326}}</ref> The ''Letter to Coroticus'' implies that the [[Franks]] were still pagans at the time of writing:<ref name=\"\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn 1995, p. 26\">{{harvnb|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|1995|p=26}}</ref> their conversion to Christianity is dated to the period 496\u2013508.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancliffe|2004}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish annals]] for the fifth century date Patrick's arrival in Ireland at 432, but they were compiled in the mid 6th century at the earliest.<ref name=\"\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn 1995, p. 26\"/> The date 432 was probably chosen to minimise the contribution of [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]], who was known to have been sent to Ireland in 431, and maximise that of Patrick.<ref name=\"Byrne78\u201379\"/> A variety of dates are given for his death.

Palladius was not the only early cleric in Ireland at this time. The Irish-born Saint [[Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir]] lived in the later fourth century (352\u2013402) and was the first bishop of [[Diocese of Ossory|Ossory]]. Ciaran, along with saints [[Auxilius of Ireland|Auxilius]], [[Secundinus]] and [[Iserninus]], is also associated with early churches in [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]]. By this reading, [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] was active in Ireland until the 460s.<ref>Byrne, pp. 78\u201379; {{harvnb|De Paor|1993|pp=6\u20137, 88\u201389}}; {{harvnb|Duffy|1997|pp=16\u201317}}; {{harvnb|Fletcher|1997|pp=300\u201306}}; {{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=112}}</ref>\n\nProsper associates Palladius' appointment with the visits of [[Germanus of Auxerre]] to Britain to suppress [[Pelagianism]] and it has been suggested that Palladius and his colleagues were sent to Ireland to ensure that exiled Pelagians did not establish themselves among the Irish Christians. The appointment of Palladius and his fellow-bishops was not obviously a mission to convert the Irish, but more probably intended to minister to existing Christian communities in Ireland.<ref>There may well have been Christian \"Irish\" people in Britain at this time; [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic-speaking]] people were found on both sides of the [[Irish Sea]], with Irish being spoken from [[Cornwall]] to [[Argyll]].

B. Bury]], his landing place was [[Wicklow]], [[Co. Wicklow]], at the mouth of the river Inver-dea, which is now called the Vartry.<ref name=\"Bury81\"/> Bury suggests that Wicklow was also the port through which Patrick made his escape after his six years' captivity, though he offers only circumstantial evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Bury31\"/> Tradition has it that Patrick was not welcomed by the locals and was forced to leave and seek a more welcoming landing place further north. He rested for some days at the islands off the Skerries coast, one of which still retains the name of Inis-Patrick. The first sanctuary dedicated by Patrick was at Saul. Shortly thereafter Benin (or [[Benignus of Armagh|Benignus]]), son of the chieftain Secsnen, joined Patrick's group.<ref name=Moran/>\n\nMuch of the ''Declaration'' concerns charges made against Patrick by his fellow Christians at a trial. What these charges were, he does not say explicitly, but he writes that he returned the gifts which wealthy women gave him, did not accept payment for [[baptism]]s, nor for [[ordain]]ing priests, and indeed paid for many gifts to kings and judges, and paid for the sons of chiefs to accompany him. It is concluded, therefore, that he was accused of some sort of financial impropriety, and perhaps of having obtained his bishopric in Ireland with personal gain in mind.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1981|pp=337\u201341}}; {{harvnb|De Paor|1993|pp=104\u201307}}; {{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=217\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe condemnation might have contributed to his decision to return to Ireland. According to Patrick\u2019s most recent biographer, Roy Flechner, the ''Confessio'' was written in part as a defence against his detractors, who did not believe that he was taken to Ireland as a slave, despite Patrick\u2019s vigorous insistence that he was.<ref>See {{harvnb|Flechner|2019|p=55}}</ref> Patrick eventually returned to Ireland, probably settling in the west of the island, where, in later life, he became a bishop and ordained subordinate clerics.\n\nFrom this same evidence, something can be seen of Patrick's mission.

This is partly because, as he says at points, he was writing for a local audience of Christians who knew him and his work. There are several mentions of travelling around the island, and of sometimes difficult interactions with the ruling elite. He does claim of the Irish: <blockquote>Never before did they know of God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. The sons and daughters of the leaders of the Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!<ref>[http://www.confessio.ie/etexts/confessio_english#01 ''Confessio'', section 41]</ref></blockquote> Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship, fosterage and affinity.

However, the emphasis T\u00edrech\u00e1n and Muirchu placed on female converts, and in particular royal and noble women who became nuns, is thought to be a genuine insight into Patrick's work of conversion. Patrick also worked with the unfree and the poor, encouraging them to vows of monastic chastity. T\u00edrech\u00e1n's account suggests that many early Patrician churches were combined with nunneries founded by Patrick's noble female converts.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=224\u201326}}</ref>\n\nThe martial Patrick found in T\u00edrech\u00e1n and Muirchu, and in later accounts, echoes similar figures found during the conversion of the [[Roman Empire]] to Christianity.

In the same period, [[Wilfrid II (bishop of York)|Wilfred]], [[Archbishop of York]], claimed to speak, as [[metropolitan archbishop]], \"for all the northern part of Britain and of Ireland\" at a council held in Rome in the time of [[Pope Agatho]], thus claiming jurisdiction over the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=416\u201317 & 429\u201340}}</ref>\n\nOther presumed early materials include the [[Irish annals]], which contain records from the [[Chronicle of Ireland]].

The bell was part of a collection of \"relics of Patrick\" removed from his tomb sixty years after his death by [[Colum Cille]] to be used as relics. The bell is described as \"The Bell of the Testament\", one of three relics of \"precious minna\" (extremely valuable items), of which the other two are described as Patrick's goblet and \"The Angels Gospel\". Colum Cille is described to have been under the direction of an \"Angel\" for whom he sent the goblet to [[County Down|Down]], the bell to [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and kept possession of the Angel's Gospel for himself. The name Angels Gospel is given to the book because it was supposed that Colum Cille received it from the angel's hand. A stir was caused in 1044 when two kings, in some dispute over the bell, went on spates of prisoner taking and cattle theft. The annals make one more apparent reference to the bell when chronicling a death, of 1356: \"Solomon Ua Mellain, The Keeper of The Bell of the Testament, protector, rested in Christ.\"\n\nThe bell was encased in a \"bell shrine\", a distinctive Irish type of [[reliquary]] made for it, as an inscription records, by King [[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] sometime between 1091 and 1105. The shrine is an important example of the final, Viking-influenced, style of Irish [[Celtic art]], with intricate [[Urnes style]] decoration in gold and silver. The Gaelic inscription on the shrine also records the name of the maker \"U INMAINEN\" (which translates to \"Noonan\"), \"who with his sons enriched/decorated it\"; metalwork was often inscribed for remembrance.\n\nThe bell itself is simple in design, hammered into shape with a small handle fixed to the top with rivets. Originally forged from iron, it has since been coated in bronze. The shrine is inscribed with three names, including King Domnall Ua Lochlainn's. The rear of the shrine, not intended to be seen, is decorated with crosses while the handle is decorated with, among other work, Celtic designs of birds. The bell is accredited with working a miracle in 1044 and having been coated in bronze to shield it from human eyes, for which it would be too holy. It measures 12.5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10&nbsp;cm at the base, 12.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4&nbsp;cm at the shoulder, 16.5&nbsp;cm from base to shoulder, 3.3&nbsp;cm from shoulder to top of handle and weighs 1.7&nbsp;kg.<ref>[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/113771/rec/1 Treasures of early Irish art, 1500 B.C. to 1500 A.D.: from the collections of the National Museum of Ireland, Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College, Dublin], an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), bell No. 45, shrine # 61; [http://clanmaclochlainn.com/bell.htm ''The Bellshrine of St. Patrick''], Clan McLaughlan website</ref>\n\n==Saint Patrick's Breastplate==\n{{Main|Saint Patrick's Breastplate}}\nSaint Patrick's Breastplate is a ''[[Lorica (prayer)|lorica]]'', or hymn, which is attributed to Patrick during his Irish ministry in the 5th century.\n\n==Saint Patrick and Irish identity==\n[[File:Strangford (18c), August 2009.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Logo of Down District Council showing the cross patt\u00e9e]]\nPatrick features in many stories in the Irish oral tradition and there are many customs connected with his feast day. The folklorist Jenny Butler<ref>Butler, Jenny (2012), \"St. Patrick, Folklore and Irish National Identity\" 84\u2013101 in Heimo, Anne; Hovi, Tuomas; Vasenkari, Maria, ed. Saint Urho \u2013 Pyh\u00e4 Urho \u2013 From Fakelore To Folklore, University of Turku: Finland. {{ISBN|978-951-29-4897-0}}</ref> discusses how these traditions have been given new layers of meaning over time while also becoming tied to Irish identity both in Ireland and abroad. The symbolic resonance of the Saint Patrick figure is complex and multifaceted, stretching from that of Christianity's arrival in Ireland to an identity that encompasses everything Irish. In some portrayals, the saint is symbolically synonymous with the Christian religion itself. There is also evidence of a combination of indigenous religious traditions with that of Christianity, which places St Patrick in the wider framework of [[cultural hybridity]]. Popular religious expression has this characteristic feature of merging elements of culture. Later in time, the saint becomes associated specifically with Catholic Ireland and synonymously with Irish national identity. Subsequently, Saint Patrick is a patriotic symbol along with the colour green and the shamrock. Saint Patrick's Day celebrations include many traditions that are known to be relatively recent historically, but have endured through time because of their association either with religious or national identity. They have persisted in such a way that they have become stalwart traditions, viewed as the strongest \"Irish traditions\".\n\n==Sainthood and modern remembrance==\n[[File:Icon of Saint Patrick, Christ the Saviour Church.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Icon]] of Saint Patrick from Christ the Savior Orthodox Church, [[Wayne, WV]].]]\n[[File:NewYorkStPatrick03.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City, as seen from [[Rockefeller Center]].]]\n17 March, popularly known as [[Saint Patrick's Day]], is believed to be his death date and is the date celebrated as his [[Feast Day]].<ref>{{cite book |trans-title=Great [[Synaxarium|Synaxaristes]] |language=el |chapter-url=http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/2959/sxsaintinfo.aspx |chapter=\u1f49 \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f38\u03c1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 |trans-chapter=The Agios Patricios Apostle of Ireland |quote=\u0397\u03bc. \u0395\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2: 17 \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 [Feast Date: March 17] |title=\u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a5\u039d\u0391\u039e\u0391\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0397\u03a3}}</ref> The day became a feast day in the Catholic Church due to the influence of the [[Waterford]]-born [[Franciscan]] scholar [[Luke Wadding]], as a member of the commission for the reform of the [[Breviary]] in the early part of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Luke Wadding|author=Gregory Cleary|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15521d.htm}}</ref>\n\nFor most of Christianity's first thousand years, canonisations were done on the diocesan or regional level.

This was recorded by [[William of Malmesbury]] in his document \"De antiquitate Glastoniensis ecclesiae (Concerning the Antiquity of Glastonbury)\" that was compiled between 1129-35, where it was noted that \u201cAfter converting the Irish and establishing them solidly in the Catholic faith he returned to his native land, and was led by guidance from on high to Glastonbury. There he came upon certain holy men living the life of hermits. Finding themselves all of one mind with Patrick they decided to form a community, and elected him as their superior.

He has been generally so regarded ever since, despite evidence of some earlier Christian presence in Ireland.\n\nAccording to the autobiographical ''Confessio'' of Patrick, when he was about sixteen, he was captured by Irish pirates from his home in Britain and taken as a [[Slavery in medieval Europe|slave]] to Ireland, looking after animals; he lived there for six years before escaping and returning to his family. After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland. In later life, he served as a bishop, but little is known about the places where he worked. By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.\n\n[[Saint Patrick's Day]] is observed on 17 March, the supposed date of his death. It is celebrated inside and outside Ireland as a religious and cultural holiday. In the dioceses of Ireland, it is both a [[solemnity]] and a [[holy day of obligation]]; it is also a celebration of Ireland itself.\n\n==Sources==\nTwo [[Latin]] works survive which are generally accepted as having been written by St. Patrick.

[[T\u00edrech\u00e1n]]'s seventh-century ''Collectanea'' gives: \"Magonus, that is, famous; Succetus, that is, god of war; Patricius, that is, father of the citizens; Cothirthiacus, because he served four houses of druids.\"<ref name=Dumville90>{{harvnb|Dumville|1993|p=90}}</ref> \"Magonus\" appears in the ninth century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' as ''Maun'', descending from British ''*Magunos'', meaning \"servant-lad\".<ref name=Dumville90 /> \"Succetus\", which also appears in [[Muirch\u00fa moccu Machtheni]]'s seventh century ''Life'' as ''Sochet'',<ref name=Dumville90 /> is identified by Mac Neill as \"a word of British origin meaning swineherd\".<ref name=EMN>Eoin Mac Neill, ''St. Patrick'', Clonmore and Reynolds, 1964, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Cothirthiacus also appears as ''Cothraige'' in the 8th century biographical poem known as ''Fiacc's Hymn'' and a variety of other spellings elsewhere, and is taken to represent a [[Primitive Irish]] ''*Qatrikias'', although this is disputed. Harvey argues that ''Cothraige'' \"has the form of a classic Old Irish tribal (and therefore place-) name\", noting that ''Ail Coithrigi'' is a name for the [[Rock of Cashel]], and the place-names ''Cothrugu'' and ''Catrige'' are attested in Counties [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Carlow|Carlow]].<ref>Anthony Harvey, \"The Significance of ''Cothraige''\", ''[[\u00c9riu (journal)|\u00c9riu]]'' Vol. 36, 1985, pp. 1\u20139</ref>\n\n===Dating===\n[[File:Gravestone of St. Patrick, Downpatrick 2018-07-25.jpg|thumb|The reputed burial place of Saint Patrick in [[Downpatrick]]]]\nThe dates of Patrick's life are uncertain; there are conflicting traditions regarding the year of his death. His own writings provide no evidence for any dating more precise than the 5th century generally. His Biblical quotations are a mixture of the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] version and the [[Vulgate]], completed in the early 5th century, suggesting he was writing \"at the point of transition from Old Latin to Vulgate\",<ref>{{harvnb|Dumville|1993|p=16}}</ref> although it is possible the Vulgate readings may have been added later, replacing earlier readings.<ref>See {{harvnb|Flechner|2011|pp=125\u201326}}</ref> The ''Letter to Coroticus'' implies that the [[Franks]] were still pagans at the time of writing:<ref name=\"\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn 1995, p. 26\">{{harvnb|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|1995|p=26}}</ref> their conversion to Christianity is dated to the period 496\u2013508.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancliffe|2004}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish annals]] for the fifth century date Patrick's arrival in Ireland at 432, but they were compiled in the mid 6th century at the earliest.<ref name=\"\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn 1995, p. 26\"/> The date 432 was probably chosen to minimise the contribution of [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]], who was known to have been sent to Ireland in 431, and maximise that of Patrick.<ref name=\"Byrne78\u201379\"/> A variety of dates are given for his death. In 457 \"the elder Patrick\" ({{lang-ga|Patraic Sen}}) is said to have died: this may refer to the death of Palladius, who according to the ''[[Book of Armagh]]'' was also called Patrick.<ref name=\"Byrne78\u201379\"/> In 461/2 the annals say that \"Here some record the repose of Patrick\";<ref name=Henny>[[William Maunsell Hennessy|Hennessy, W.

Palladius was not the only early cleric in Ireland at this time. The Irish-born Saint [[Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir]] lived in the later fourth century (352\u2013402) and was the first bishop of [[Diocese of Ossory|Ossory]]. Ciaran, along with saints [[Auxilius of Ireland|Auxilius]], [[Secundinus]] and [[Iserninus]], is also associated with early churches in [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]].

He explains that the Lord had mercy on his youth and ignorance, and afforded him the opportunity to be forgiven his sins and convert to Christianity. While in captivity, he worked as a shepherd and strengthened his relationship with God through prayer, eventually leading him to convert to Christianity.<ref name=\"ccel.org\"/>\n\nAfter six years of captivity he heard a voice telling him that he would soon go home, and then that his ship was ready. Fleeing his master, he travelled to a port, two hundred miles away,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/patrick/confession.v.html |title=Confession of St. Patrick, Part 17 |website=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> where he found a ship and with difficulty persuaded the captain to take him. After three days' sailing, they landed, presumably in Britain, and apparently all left the ship, walking for 28 days in a \"wilderness\" and becoming faint from hunger. After Patrick prayed for sustenance, they encountered a herd of [[wild boar]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Confession #19 |url=http://www.confessio.ie/etexts/confessio_english#19 |website=St Patrick's Confessio |publisher=Royal Irish Academy}}</ref> since this was shortly after Patrick had urged them to put their faith in God, his prestige in the group was greatly increased.

His name was Victoricus, and he carried many letters, and he gave me one of them. I read the heading: \"The Voice of the Irish\". As I began the letter, I imagined in that moment that I heard the voice of those very people who were near the wood of [[Foclut]], which is beside the western sea\u2014and they cried out, as with one voice: \"We appeal to you, holy servant boy, to come and walk among us.\"<ref>{{harvnb|De Paor|1993|p=100}} De Paor glosses Foclut as \"west of [[Killala]] Bay, in [[County Mayo]]\", but it appears that the location of Fochoill (Foclut or Voclut) is still a matter of debate. See {{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|p=215}}; Confessio; 17</ref></blockquote>\n\nA.B.E. Hood suggests that the Victoricus of St. Patrick's vision may be identified with Saint [[Victricius]], bishop of [[Rouen]] in the late fourth century, who had visited Britain in an official capacity in 396.<ref>{{harvnb|Hood|1978|p=4}}</ref> However, Ludwig Bieler disagrees.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgkQIcRgNk0C&pg=PA349&dq=Monasticism+in+late+Roman+Britain |last=Thomas |first=Charles |title=Christianity in Roman Britain to AD 500 |page=51 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0520043923}}</ref>\n\nPatrick studied in Europe principally at [[Auxerre]], but is thought to have visited the [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours]] and to have received the [[tonsure]] at [[L\u00e9rins Abbey]]. [[Saint Germanus of Auxerre]], a bishop of the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], ordained him to the priesthood.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bridgwater |editor1-first=William |editor2-last=Kurtz |editor2-first=Seymour |year=1963 |chapter=Saint Patrick |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |pages=1611\u201312}}</ref><ref name=Moran>{{catholic|wstitle=St. Patrick|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11554a.htm}}</ref>\n\nActing on his vision, Patrick returned to Ireland as a Christian missionary.<ref name=\"ccel.org\"/> According to [[J. B. Bury]], his landing place was [[Wicklow]], [[Co. Wicklow]], at the mouth of the river Inver-dea, which is now called the Vartry.<ref name=\"Bury81\"/> Bury suggests that Wicklow was also the port through which Patrick made his escape after his six years' captivity, though he offers only circumstantial evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Bury31\"/> Tradition has it that Patrick was not welcomed by the locals and was forced to leave and seek a more welcoming landing place further north. He rested for some days at the islands off the Skerries coast, one of which still retains the name of Inis-Patrick. The first sanctuary dedicated by Patrick was at Saul. Shortly thereafter Benin (or [[Benignus of Armagh|Benignus]]), son of the chieftain Secsnen, joined Patrick's group.<ref name=Moran/>\n\nMuch of the ''Declaration'' concerns charges made against Patrick by his fellow Christians at a trial. What these charges were, he does not say explicitly, but he writes that he returned the gifts which wealthy women gave him, did not accept payment for [[baptism]]s, nor for [[ordain]]ing priests, and indeed paid for many gifts to kings and judges, and paid for the sons of chiefs to accompany him. It is concluded, therefore, that he was accused of some sort of financial impropriety, and perhaps of having obtained his bishopric in Ireland with personal gain in mind.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1981|pp=337\u201341}}; {{harvnb|De Paor|1993|pp=104\u201307}}; {{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=217\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe condemnation might have contributed to his decision to return to Ireland. According to Patrick\u2019s most recent biographer, Roy Flechner, the ''Confessio'' was written in part as a defence against his detractors, who did not believe that he was taken to Ireland as a slave, despite Patrick\u2019s vigorous insistence that he was.<ref>See {{harvnb|Flechner|2019|p=55}}</ref> Patrick eventually returned to Ireland, probably settling in the west of the island, where, in later life, he became a bishop and ordained subordinate clerics.\n\nFrom this same evidence, something can be seen of Patrick's mission. He writes that he \"baptised thousands of people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/patrick/confession.x.html |title=Confession of St. Patrick, Part 50 |website=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> He ordained priests to lead the new Christian communities. He converted wealthy women, some of whom became [[nun]]s in the face of family opposition. He also dealt with the sons of kings, converting them too.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=219\u201325}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|1981|pp=337\u201341}}; {{harvnb|De Paor|1993|pp=104\u201307}}</ref> The ''Confessio'' is generally vague about the details of his work in Ireland, though giving some specific instances. This is partly because, as he says at points, he was writing for a local audience of Christians who knew him and his work. There are several mentions of travelling around the island, and of sometimes difficult interactions with the ruling elite. He does claim of the Irish: <blockquote>Never before did they know of God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. The sons and daughters of the leaders of the Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!<ref>[http://www.confessio.ie/etexts/confessio_english#01 ''Confessio'', section 41]</ref></blockquote> Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship, fosterage and affinity. Legally he was without protection, and he says that he was on one occasion beaten, robbed of all he had, and put in chains, perhaps awaiting execution.<ref>{{harvnb|De Paor|1993|p=107}}; {{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=221\u201322}}</ref> Patrick says that he was also \"many years later\" a captive for 60 days, without giving details.<ref>Confessio; 21</ref>\n\nMurchi\u00fa's life of Saint Patrick contains a supposed prophecy by the [[druid]]s which gives an impression of how Patrick and other Christian missionaries were seen by those hostile to them:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Across the sea will come [[Adze]]-head,<ref>This is presumed to refer to Patrick's [[tonsure]].</ref> crazed in the head,\nhis cloak with hole for the head, his stick bent in the head.\nHe will chant impieties from a table in the front of his house;\nall his people will answer: \"so be it, so be it.\"<ref>After {{harvnb|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|1995|p=32}}; {{harvnb|De Paor|1993|p=180}} See also {{harvnb|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|1995|pp=30\u201333}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nThe second piece of evidence that comes from Patrick's life is the ''Letter to Coroticus'' or ''Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus'', written after a first remonstrance was received with ridicule and insult.

However, the emphasis T\u00edrech\u00e1n and Muirchu placed on female converts, and in particular royal and noble women who became nuns, is thought to be a genuine insight into Patrick's work of conversion. Patrick also worked with the unfree and the poor, encouraging them to vows of monastic chastity. T\u00edrech\u00e1n's account suggests that many early Patrician churches were combined with nunneries founded by Patrick's noble female converts.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=224\u201326}}</ref>\n\nThe martial Patrick found in T\u00edrech\u00e1n and Muirchu, and in later accounts, echoes similar figures found during the conversion of the [[Roman Empire]] to Christianity. It may be doubted whether such accounts are an accurate representation of Patrick's time, although such violent events may well have occurred as Christians gained in strength and numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|1995|pp=30\u201333}}.

In the same period, [[Wilfrid II (bishop of York)|Wilfred]], [[Archbishop of York]], claimed to speak, as [[metropolitan archbishop]], \"for all the northern part of Britain and of Ireland\" at a council held in Rome in the time of [[Pope Agatho]], thus claiming jurisdiction over the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000|pp=416\u201317 & 429\u201340}}</ref>\n\nOther presumed early materials include the [[Irish annals]], which contain records from the [[Chronicle of Ireland]].

The bell was part of a collection of \"relics of Patrick\" removed from his tomb sixty years after his death by [[Colum Cille]] to be used as relics. The bell is described as \"The Bell of the Testament\", one of three relics of \"precious minna\" (extremely valuable items), of which the other two are described as Patrick's goblet and \"The Angels Gospel\". Colum Cille is described to have been under the direction of an \"Angel\" for whom he sent the goblet to [[County Down|Down]], the bell to [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and kept possession of the Angel's Gospel for himself. The name Angels Gospel is given to the book because it was supposed that Colum Cille received it from the angel's hand. A stir was caused in 1044 when two kings, in some dispute over the bell, went on spates of prisoner taking and cattle theft. The annals make one more apparent reference to the bell when chronicling a death, of 1356: \"Solomon Ua Mellain, The Keeper of The Bell of the Testament, protector, rested in Christ.\"\n\nThe bell was encased in a \"bell shrine\", a distinctive Irish type of [[reliquary]] made for it, as an inscription records, by King [[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] sometime between 1091 and 1105. The shrine is an important example of the final, Viking-influenced, style of Irish [[Celtic art]], with intricate [[Urnes style]] decoration in gold and silver. The Gaelic inscription on the shrine also records the name of the maker \"U INMAINEN\" (which translates to \"Noonan\"), \"who with his sons enriched/decorated it\"; metalwork was often inscribed for remembrance.\n\nThe bell itself is simple in design, hammered into shape with a small handle fixed to the top with rivets. Originally forged from iron, it has since been coated in bronze. The shrine is inscribed with three names, including King Domnall Ua Lochlainn's. The rear of the shrine, not intended to be seen, is decorated with crosses while the handle is decorated with, among other work, Celtic designs of birds. The bell is accredited with working a miracle in 1044 and having been coated in bronze to shield it from human eyes, for which it would be too holy. It measures 12.5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10&nbsp;cm at the base, 12.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4&nbsp;cm at the shoulder, 16.5&nbsp;cm from base to shoulder, 3.3&nbsp;cm from shoulder to top of handle and weighs 1.7&nbsp;kg.<ref>[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/113771/rec/1 Treasures of early Irish art, 1500 B.C. to 1500 A.D.: from the collections of the National Museum of Ireland, Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College, Dublin], an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), bell No. 45, shrine # 61; [http://clanmaclochlainn.com/bell.htm ''The Bellshrine of St. Patrick''], Clan McLaughlan website</ref>\n\n==Saint Patrick's Breastplate==\n{{Main|Saint Patrick's Breastplate}}\nSaint Patrick's Breastplate is a ''[[Lorica (prayer)|lorica]]'', or hymn, which is attributed to Patrick during his Irish ministry in the 5th century.\n\n==Saint Patrick and Irish identity==\n[[File:Strangford (18c), August 2009.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Logo of Down District Council showing the cross patt\u00e9e]]\nPatrick features in many stories in the Irish oral tradition and there are many customs connected with his feast day. The folklorist Jenny Butler<ref>Butler, Jenny (2012), \"St. Patrick, Folklore and Irish National Identity\" 84\u2013101 in Heimo, Anne; Hovi, Tuomas; Vasenkari, Maria, ed. Saint Urho \u2013 Pyh\u00e4 Urho \u2013 From Fakelore To Folklore, University of Turku: Finland. {{ISBN|978-951-29-4897-0}}</ref> discusses how these traditions have been given new layers of meaning over time while also becoming tied to Irish identity both in Ireland and abroad. The symbolic resonance of the Saint Patrick figure is complex and multifaceted, stretching from that of Christianity's arrival in Ireland to an identity that encompasses everything Irish. In some portrayals, the saint is symbolically synonymous with the Christian religion itself. There is also evidence of a combination of indigenous religious traditions with that of Christianity, which places St Patrick in the wider framework of [[cultural hybridity]]. Popular religious expression has this characteristic feature of merging elements of culture. Later in time, the saint becomes associated specifically with Catholic Ireland and synonymously with Irish national identity. Subsequently, Saint Patrick is a patriotic symbol along with the colour green and the shamrock. Saint Patrick's Day celebrations include many traditions that are known to be relatively recent historically, but have endured through time because of their association either with religious or national identity. They have persisted in such a way that they have become stalwart traditions, viewed as the strongest \"Irish traditions\".\n\n==Sainthood and modern remembrance==\n[[File:Icon of Saint Patrick, Christ the Saviour Church.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Icon]] of Saint Patrick from Christ the Savior Orthodox Church, [[Wayne, WV]].]]\n[[File:NewYorkStPatrick03.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City, as seen from [[Rockefeller Center]].]]\n17 March, popularly known as [[Saint Patrick's Day]], is believed to be his death date and is the date celebrated as his [[Feast Day]].<ref>{{cite book |trans-title=Great [[Synaxarium|Synaxaristes]] |language=el |chapter-url=http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/2959/sxsaintinfo.aspx |chapter=\u1f49 \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f38\u03c1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 |trans-chapter=The Agios Patricios Apostle of Ireland |quote=\u0397\u03bc. \u0395\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2: 17 \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 [Feast Date: March 17] |title=\u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a5\u039d\u0391\u039e\u0391\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u0397\u03a3}}</ref> The day became a feast day in the Catholic Church due to the influence of the [[Waterford]]-born [[Franciscan]] scholar [[Luke Wadding]], as a member of the commission for the reform of the [[Breviary]] in the early part of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Luke Wadding|author=Gregory Cleary|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15521d.htm}}</ref>\n\nFor most of Christianity's first thousand years, canonisations were done on the diocesan or regional level. Relatively soon after the death of people considered very holy, the local Church affirmed that they could be liturgically celebrated as saints. As a result, Patrick has never been formally [[canonisation|canonised]] by a pope; nevertheless, various Christian churches declare that he is a saint in Heaven (he is in the [[List of Saints]]). He is still widely venerated in Ireland and elsewhere today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask a Franciscan: Saints Come From All Nations \u2013 March 2001 Issue of St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online|accessdate=25 August 2006|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Mar2001/Wiseman.asp#F4}}</ref>\n\nPatrick is honoured with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] and with a commemoration on the calendar of ''Evangelical Lutheran Worship,'' both on 17 March.

One theory is that he herded sheep in the countryside around Slemish. Another theory is that Patrick herded sheep near Killala Bay, at a place called Fochill.\n* [[Glastonbury Abbey]], [[Somerset]], [[UK]]\n:It is claimed that he was buried within the Abbey grounds next to the high alter, which has led to many believing this is why Glastonbury was popular among Irish pilgrims. This was recorded by [[William of Malmesbury]] in his document \"De antiquitate Glastoniensis ecclesiae (Concerning the Antiquity of Glastonbury)\" that was compiled between 1129-35, where it was noted that \u201cAfter converting the Irish and establishing them solidly in the Catholic faith he returned to his native land, and was led by guidance from on high to Glastonbury. There he came upon certain holy men living the life of hermits. Finding themselves all of one mind with Patrick they decided to form a community, and elected him as their superior. Later, two of their members resided on the Tor to serve its Chapel.\u201d<ref>Ademi de Domerham Historia de Rebus Gestis Glastoniensibus, ed. T. Hearne, Oxford, 1727, see:- Glastonbury Library.</ref> The Abbey also has a chapel named after St.Patrick which is a sight of pilgrimage to this day. The well known Irish Scholar [[James_Carney_(scholar)|James Carney]] also elaborated on this claim and wrote \u201cit is possible that Patrick, tired and ill at the end of his arduous mission felt released from his vow not to leave Ireland, and returned to the monastery from which he had come, which might have been Glastonbury\u201d.<ref>J.

Part of the Allied plan for the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of mainland Europe]] called for the capture of port facilities, in order to ensure the timely delivery of the enormous amount of war [[wikt:materiel|materiel]] required to supply the invading Allied forces. It was estimated that the 37 Allied divisions to be on the continent by September 1944 would need 26,000 tons of supplies each day.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher =  |isbn =  0-8317-2188-X|last =  Kirkpatrick|first =  Charles|title =  D-Day: Operation Overlord: From the Landings at Normandy to the Liberation of Paris|url-access =  registration|url =  https://archive.org/details/ddayoperationove0000unse}}</ref> The main port the Allied forces hoped to seize and put into their service was [[Brest, France|Brest]], in northwestern France.\n\n==Background==\nEarly in the war, after the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, the United States and the United Kingdom began planning an eventual \"Invasion of Western Europe\" to be put into effect when and if the United States joined the war. American and Canadian troops would be moved from North America to England (as long as the United Kingdom was still in the war), until an Allied invasion could be mounted to the continent.\n\nA major issue was how to supply the invasion army with the tens of thousands of tons of materiel it would need after it landed. The capture of ports on the European Atlantic coast was a necessity, and the most suitable ones were clear invasion objectives. The capture of these port facilities was deemed crucial, because the lack of supplies would easily strand an invading army. For the initial phase of the battle, large artificial ports ([[Mulberry Harbour|Mulberry Harbors]]) would be erected on the beaches, but they had limited tonnage unloading capabilities, and were considered as a contingency until real ports could be captured and put into service.\n\nSuitable ports could be found along the northern coast of France, across the [[English Channel]] which would be crossed by the invading armies, in particular the port of Brest in [[Brittany]], for a long time the main French Fleet harbor on the Atlantic coast and the westernmost port in France. The Allied strategists even considered it possible that, after its capture, supplies could arrive directly from the US to Brest, bypassing England and reaching the Allied Armies moving east, towards Germany, much faster.\n\nOther ports across the English Channel were [[Saint Malo]], [[Lorient]], and [[Saint Nazaire]] in Brittany and [[Cherbourg]] and [[Le Havre]] in Normandy (which would eventually be selected as the Invasion area). [[Operation Sledgehammer]], the capture of Cherbourg, had been considered by the Allies, but it was cancelled after the disastrous 1942 [[Dieppe Raid]]. It was decided that a direct attack on a port from the sea was not an option.\n\nHowever, the Germans, realizing this, began building fortifications around these ports earlier in the war through their [[Organisation Todt|Organization Todt]], as part of the [[Atlantic Wall]] concept. Some of these ports were major [[U-boat]] bases as well, and had bomb-proof concrete submarine pens built. These fortifications had been surviving Allied air strikes for some time.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:approachtobrest.png|thumb|left|300px|NW France by mid-August, 1944. The Allies manage to occupy the Breton countryside and are already moving east towards Paris. The blue arrows represent the approach routes to Brest and other ports]]\nSoon after Normandy was invaded, the Mulberries were towed from England and deployed on the French coast. Unfortunately for the Allies, one of them was destroyed after less than two weeks. Supplies were then mainly landed directly via the beaches, but this process was not as efficient.\n\n[[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], at the tip of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in Normandy, was captured by the Americans who landed on [[Utah Beach]], but the German garrison destroyed its harbour facilities before surrendering. Cherbourg was the only major port in the Allied invasion area. Soon after, the Germans in the [[Brittany (peninsula)|Brittany]] [[peninsula]] were isolated by a north-south breakthrough accomplished by [[George S. Patton]]'s [[Third United States Army]], exploiting the success of [[Operation Cobra]]. The US VIII Corps was diverted into Brittany to capture Brest and secure the northern flank of the breakthrough. ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' troops trapped in Brittany retreated to the fortified ports in the peninsula, as US Third Army troops moved in and surrounded them. The Brest garrison, ''Festung Brest'', meaning \"Fortress Brest\", as German [[propaganda]] referred to surrounded cities, was put under the command of [[General (Germany)|General der Fallschirmtruppe]] [[Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke]], a paratroop veteran of the [[Afrika Korps]]. His forces consisted of the German [[2nd Parachute Division (Germany)|2nd Parachute Division]], [[266th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|266th Infantry Division]], [[343rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|343rd Infantry Division]] and other ''Wehrmacht'' elements, in all some 40,000 fighting men.\n\nThe old fortress city of [[Saint-Malo]] was captured by the [[83rd Infantry Division (United States)|83rd Infantry Division]] (\"Ohio\") on 17 August, but its small port facilities were sabotaged by the defenders. A German garrison stationed at nearby [[C\u00e9zembre]] Island surrendered only after days of heavy shelling by warships and strong air strikes, when their naval guns were already disabled. The aerial bombing of the island marked one of the first uses of [[napalm]] bombs. It was clear that the Germans would deny the Allies the use of French ports as long as possible by defending the fortresses built around them and severely damaging their docks.\n\nBrest was reached by American troops on 7 August 1944.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Brittany - Brest 02.jpg|thumb|300px|Troops of the 2nd Infantry Division advance under machine gun fire into the outskirts of Brest]]\nBrest was surrounded and eventually stormed by the [[VIII Corps (United States)|U.S. VIII Corps]]. The fight proved extremely difficult, as the German garrison was well entrenched and partially made up of elite [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'']] ([[paratrooper]]) forces.\n\nThe German paratroopers lived up to their reputation, as the Allies had experienced previously in battles such as [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. Whilst some less capable units surrendered quite easily, the ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' defended their ground under considerable odds, heavy shelling, air strikes and American assaults. The attackers had many losses inflicted on them for every small advance they made into the city.\n\nAs per their military doctrine, the Americans tried to use their superior artillery firepower and air superiority to overcome the defenders, instead of fighting them hand-to-hand. The Germans had stocked a considerable amount of ammunition for the defense of the city and had weapons of all calibers (from light [[flak]] to naval guns) dug into fortifications and in [[blockhouse|pillboxes]]. Elements of the specialised British [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]] came in to attack the heavily fortified [[Fort Montbarey]]. Flamethrowing [[Churchill Crocodile]] tanks along with US infantry took three days to overcome the fort.\n\nThe fighting was intense, with the troops moving from [[urban warfare|house to house]]. The fortifications (both French and German built) proved very difficult to overcome, and heavy artillery barrages were fired by both sides.\n\nEventually the old city of Brest was razed to the ground during the battle, with only some medieval stone-built fortifications left standing.\n\nGeneral Ramcke surrendered the city on 19 September 1944 to the Americans after rendering the port facilities useless. These would not be repaired in time to help the war effort as it was hoped. By this time, [[Paris]] had already been liberated by the Allied Armies, and [[Operation Market-Garden]] was already under way in the Netherlands.\n\n===\"These Are My Credentials\"===\nWhen U.S. Brigadier General [[Charles D. W. Canham|Charles Canham]] arrived to accept Ramcke's surrender, the latter asked the lower-ranking man to show his credentials. Canham pointed to his nearby troops and said \"These are my credentials\". Canham was at the time the deputy commander of the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 8th Infantry Division]]; that phrase has since become the division's motto.\n\nThe costly capture of Brest resulted in the decision to only surround the remaining German-occupied ports in France with the exception of those that could be captured from the march, instead of storming them in a set-piece battle. The exception was Le Havre, which was taken by the [[British 2nd Army]] on 12 September 1944. Some of these Breton ports surrendered only by 9 May 1945, one day after [[Victory in Europe Day]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe whole Overlord campaign developed somewhat differently than originally planned. Patton's US Third Army's quick advance allowed the [[Liberation of Paris]] to occur earlier than expected, but by September 1944 supplies were beginning to run short.\n[[File:Fort Montbarey1.JPG|thumb|300px|Fort Montbary today with a [[Churchill Crocodile|Churchill 'Crocodile']]]]\n\nCherbourg was the only port that was repaired in time to be used and therefore by the end of the war in Europe despite the U.S. Army committing 75,000 troups to the capture of Brest of which 10,000 would become casualties, not a single Allied troop ship or supply vessel had docked in Brest <ref>{{Cite book|publisher = Stackpole Books|isbn = 9780811740500|last =  Balkoski|first = Joseph E.|title = From Beachhead to Brittany, The 29th Infantry Division at Brest, August-September 1944|page = xiii| year = 2008}}, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Beachhead_to_Brittany/5iwZfCjS2GgC?hl=en&gbpv=0 partial text at Google Books]</ref>. The harbor's capacity was approximately 2,000 tons a day in mid-July and 12,000 tons by August 1944.\n\nA decision was made to favor the British forces under Sir [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] by reducing the supplies to other forces, including Patton's.

Flamethrowing [[Churchill Crocodile]] tanks along with US infantry took three days to overcome the fort.\n\nThe fighting was intense, with the troops moving from [[urban warfare|house to house]]. The fortifications (both French and German built) proved very difficult to overcome, and heavy artillery barrages were fired by both sides.\n\nEventually the old city of Brest was razed to the ground during the battle, with only some medieval stone-built fortifications left standing.\n\nGeneral Ramcke surrendered the city on 19 September 1944 to the Americans after rendering the port facilities useless. These would not be repaired in time to help the war effort as it was hoped. By this time, [[Paris]] had already been liberated by the Allied Armies, and [[Operation Market-Garden]] was already under way in the Netherlands.\n\n===\"These Are My Credentials\"===\nWhen U.S. Brigadier General [[Charles D. W. Canham|Charles Canham]] arrived to accept Ramcke's surrender, the latter asked the lower-ranking man to show his credentials. Canham pointed to his nearby troops and said \"These are my credentials\". Canham was at the time the deputy commander of the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 8th Infantry Division]]; that phrase has since become the division's motto.\n\nThe costly capture of Brest resulted in the decision to only surround the remaining German-occupied ports in France with the exception of those that could be captured from the march, instead of storming them in a set-piece battle. The exception was Le Havre, which was taken by the [[British 2nd Army]] on 12 September 1944. Some of these Breton ports surrendered only by 9 May 1945, one day after [[Victory in Europe Day]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe whole Overlord campaign developed somewhat differently than originally planned. Patton's US Third Army's quick advance allowed the [[Liberation of Paris]] to occur earlier than expected, but by September 1944 supplies were beginning to run short.\n[[File:Fort Montbarey1.JPG|thumb|300px|Fort Montbary today with a [[Churchill Crocodile|Churchill 'Crocodile']]]]\n\nCherbourg was the only port that was repaired in time to be used and therefore by the end of the war in Europe despite the U.S. Army committing 75,000 troups to the capture of Brest of which 10,000 would become casualties, not a single Allied troop ship or supply vessel had docked in Brest <ref>{{Cite book|publisher = Stackpole Books|isbn = 9780811740500|last =  Balkoski|first = Joseph E.|title = From Beachhead to Brittany, The 29th Infantry Division at Brest, August-September 1944|page = xiii| year = 2008}}, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Beachhead_to_Brittany/5iwZfCjS2GgC?hl=en&gbpv=0 partial text at Google Books]</ref>. The harbor's capacity was approximately 2,000 tons a day in mid-July and 12,000 tons by August 1944.\n\nA decision was made to favor the British forces under Sir [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] by reducing the supplies to other forces, including Patton's.
