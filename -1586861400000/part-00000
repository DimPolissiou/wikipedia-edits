{"title_page": "List of botanical gardens", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nA [[botanical garden]] is a place where [[plant]]s, especially [[fern]]s, [[conifer]]s and [[flowering plant]]s, are grown and displayed for the purposes of [[research]], [[Wildlife|conservation]], and [[education]]. This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with showy flowers, are grown for public amenity only. [[Botanical garden]]s that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as [[arboretum]]s.  They are occasionally associated with [[zoo]]s.\n\nThe earliest botanical gardens were founded in the late [[Renaissance]] at the [[University of Pisa]] (1543) and the [[University of Padua]] (1545) in Italy, for the study and teaching of medical botany. Many universities today have botanical gardens for student teaching and academic research, e.g. the [[Arnold Arboretum]], Harvard University, US, the [[Bonn University]] Botanic Garden, Bonn, Germany, the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]], Cambridge, England, the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]], Leiden, Netherlands, and the [[Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University]], US.\n\nThis page lists important botanical gardens throughout the world.\n\nA useful database cataloging the world's botanic gardens can also be found at the [[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]] (BGCI) website.  With over 800 participating botanical gardens, BGCI forms the world's largest network for plant conservation and environmental education.<ref>[http://www.bgci.org/ Welcome to BGCI]. Bgci.org.

This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with showy flowers, are grown for public amenity only. [[Botanical garden]]s that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as [[arboretum]]s.  They are occasionally associated with [[zoo]]s.\n\nThe earliest botanical gardens were founded in the late [[Renaissance]] at the [[University of Pisa]] (1543) and the [[University of Padua]] (1545) in Italy, for the study and teaching of medical botany. Many universities today have botanical gardens for student teaching and academic research, e.g. the [[Arnold Arboretum]], Harvard University, US, the [[Bonn University]] Botanic Garden, Bonn, Germany, the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]], Cambridge, England, the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]], Leiden, Netherlands, and the [[Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University]], US.\n\nThis page lists important botanical gardens throughout the world.\n\nA useful database cataloging the world's botanic gardens can also be found at the [[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]] (BGCI) website.  With over 800 participating botanical gardens, BGCI forms the world's largest network for plant conservation and environmental education.<ref>[http://www.bgci.org/ Welcome to BGCI]. Bgci.org.

However, in Peruvian newspapers it appears as \"Estremadoyro\" (with an \"s\").</ref> He studied at the San Juli\u00e1n [[Barranco District|Barranco]] de Lima School, from which he graduated in 1960.\n\n=== Youth ===\nIn 1958, at age fifteen, he worked as a voice backup with the clowns Carlos Castro Pat, Cayo Pinto and Rulli Rendo. He then studied psychology at the [[:es:Universidad Ricardo Palma|Ricardo Palma University]] (Lima), where he received a first basic Bachelor Psychology Degree. He then traveled to Europe where he toured Spain, France and Italy. Back in Peru, he wrote two books: Mi primer pajazo (In English: My First Handjob; 1970) y Yo solo s\u00e9 que soy un imb\u00e9cil (In English: I only know I am a Moron; 1975).\n\nNews published by the Newspaper El Tiempo (In English: The Times) from [[Piura]],{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} discovered that Mario Poggi worked in this city in the middle of the seventies, in a branch of [[:es:SINAMOS|SINAMOS]] (Regional Office of Social Mobilization II). He married Peruvian journalist Carmen Manrique Arg\u00fcelles, whom he later divorced. Two children are known from the marriage, one of which, a daughter, is a sports journalist.\n\nIn the 1980s he worked as a psychologist in the National Peruvian Police. Contemporarily he began to study [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquism.]]\n\n=== Crime ===\nIn Early 1986, a wave of paranoia flooded Lima. In the city's garbage dumps, legs, human torsos and disfigured human heads began to appear at least ten times. Local Newspapers started to nickname the murderer as in their headlines as \u00ab\u00a1El Descuartizador de Lima! (Lima's dismemberer)\u00bb. The presumed killer was attributed with the authorship of, at least, seven killings.\n\nOn February 6, 1986, the Lima Police captured a suspect called, \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn (1959\u20131986), a 26-year-old from [[Chincha Alta]].<ref name=\"Caretas\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.caretas.com.pe/2000/1644/articulos/policiales.phtml | title = 50 a\u00f1os de policiales | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320125927/http://www.caretas.com.pe/2000/1644/articulos/policiales.phtml | archive-date= March 20, 2012 | first = Gast\u00f3n | last = Agurto | work = Caretas | date = November 9, 2000}}</ref> In one point during questioning, he stated he began to feel [[Delusional disorder|paranoic]] so the police called Poggi to verify the pathology.\n\nNext Day, Poggi \u2015dressed eccentrically like he used to\u2015 walked in the former headquarter of the ''Caretas'' magazine (at the Caman\u00e1 shred, located at Lima's center) and asked for a meeting with the policial genre writer Jorge Negro Salazar, \u00abVengo de estar con el descuartizador de Lima. Soy Mario Poggi, soy psic\u00f3logo de la PIP, si quieren los llevo para que vean c\u00f3mo hipnotizo al asesino y lo hago confesar sus espantosos cr\u00edmenes (I've been recently with the Lima's dismemberer. I'm Mario Poggi, I'm a psychologist from the PIP. If you want to, I'll take you so you see how I hypnotize the killer and make him confess his terrifying crimes)\u00bb.\n&nbsp;\nSalazar called the Magazine's Photographer, V\u00edctor Ch. Vargas and they went to the former Homicide treatment local, located in Avenida Espa\u00f1a (In English: Spain Avenue). Police treated Poggi calling him \u00abdoctor\u00bb. By Poggi's request, the police took Diaz Balbin handcuffed. (Almost skeletal, suffering a deep famine and with a thickened beard). Poggi began an strange ritual, touching the prisoner's head, who, by the way, didn't produce a single noise. \u00ab\u00a1Eres el descuartizador \u2015gritaba Poggi ahuecando la voz\u2015, aqu\u00ed en el cr\u00e1neo puedo palpar tu inteligencia asesina\u00bb (You're the dismemberer- Poggi screamed while hollowing out his voice- Here, in your skull, I can palpate your murderous intelligence).\n\nOn February 8, ''Caretas'' magazine feature Salazar's article along with the photographs in which Poggi \"was analyzing\" \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn.<ref name=\"Caretas\" /> &nbsp;\nNext Day, On February 9, 1986, Poggi appeared in the Media crying in the Homicide Office: \u00ab\u00a1Salv\u00e9 a la humanidad! \u00a1Acab\u00e9 con el monstruo! (I saved humankind! I finished off the monster!\u00bb. Effectively, Poggi had asked the officer on duty to bring the prisoner with his arms handcuffed to his back. Then he asked for privacy to interview the suspect. According to Poggi, when he was alone with the suspect, he took off his clothes and the suspect's. He tried to cause him sexual excitation, because he wanted to show him how he raped his victims, before killing and dismembering them. Although, D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn didn't respond to his provocations. After an hour, Poggi laid D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn face down (hand-tied and feet-tied). Took out his leather belt with suspect facing down, and strangled him. After killing D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn, he dressed back again and went out of the room he was in. He told the police officers he strangled D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn, because due to his madness, Poggi feared, he could be released and start to kill people again.<ref name=\"Caretas\"/>\n&nbsp;\nEven though, \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn was killed, the dismemberment kept on going .Poggi's Trial was considered a kind of prank on which the accused behaved like comedy showman. When he was questioned during his Trial, Poggi stated he didn't killed him, but, instead, he was blamed for D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn's Death, and said that he- aged 45- was \u00abmuy viejo para matar a ese chico\u00bb (\"too old to kill that young man\") He was sentenced to twelve years in prison, although he only stayed imprisoned for a 1/3 of his actual sentence (4 years and 8 months in the correctional of San Jorge, Lima).\n\n=== Celebrity ===\nIn 1991, Poggi was released from jail. He decided to stay away from psychology after being released. He called himself \"Loco\" (Crazy), and dyed his hair green. He then became a celebrity. He was invited to several programs, many having poor ratings, and many others that looked for a \"bizarre\" introduction or central topic.\n\nIn 1997, Poggi published his autobiography, \"''Yo S\u00f3lo S\u00e9 Que Soy Un Imb\u00e9cil'' (''I Only Know I Am A Moron'')\", in a poor quality format with green letters and recurrent orthographic, typographic, and edition errors\u2015that, according to the publisher, El Siglo, (The Century), was to show respect to the original message\u2015. It consists of an introducing chapter with delusional quotes and some passages of his life \u2015where he mixes popular characters, with Limenian Personalities\u2015, and a final chapter with some of his drawings and some art critics of his sculptures.\n\nIn 2000, Poggi participated in the filming of the movie \"''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo''\" (''My Nude Crime''), by Le\u00f3nidas Zegarra, in which he played himself. The film was released in 2001. The project began in 1998, when a group of film students wanted to bring to the big screen the story of the murder of the serial criminal Angel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn in the hands of psychologist Mario Poggi. Zegarra was invited to participate in the project asthe director. The film's production was financed mainly by loans. The equipment needed was acquired in agreement with a production company. The budget,  like in every movie by Zerraga, was  just $11.000 (equivalent to $16,388.72 as of 2019). Because of that, according to Zegarra, they came to an agreement with the actors and actresses (Mario Poggi, Am\u00e9rico Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Yesabella, Rossi War, V\u00edctor \u00c1ngeles y Wilmer Ato) to pay them when the movie was commercialized, and when they retrieved the money invested. The movie also featured the well-known Peruvian singer [[La Tigresa del Oriente]] (In English: The Eastern Tigress) portraying [[Magaly Medina]], who became famous in the next decade for her music videos on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/blogs/camaleon_con_zapatillas/2009/09/25/la-otra-tigresa-del-oriente-la-felina-que-no-colgo-su-video-en-youtube/|title= La otra Tigresa del Oriente: la felina que no colg\u00f3 su video en Youtube | first = Alfredo | last = P\u00e9rez Andrade | date=September 25, 2008 | language = Spanish | trans-title = The other Eastern Tigress: the feline who did not upload her video on YouTube |publisher=La Rep\u00fablica| url-status = dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712062644/http://larepublica.pe/blogs/camaleon_con_zapatillas/2009/09/25/la-otra-tigresa-del-oriente-la-felina-que-no-colgo-su-video-en-youtube/|archive-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo'' premiered in two Lima cinemas (Exc\u00e9lsior and Tacna). There was no money for the advertising campaign and only the popularity of the vedettes who participated in the film (such as Martha Yesabella V\u00e1squez Ch\u00e1vez) was exploited. There were also exchanges with small newspapers, which published the ads in exchange for tickets to the movies. The investment was not fully recovered and to get out of the debts, a remake was launched with the suggestive name of ''Vedettes Al Desnudo'' (''Nude Vedettes'').\n\nThe movie's story is about the psychotic \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn frightening the city of Lima and killing prostitutes. The police follow his trail and capture him, but D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn resists confessing his crimes. To force him to do so, they call psychologist Mario Poggi, who manages to make him confess. However, Poggi believes that the release of Diaz Balbin is imminent, so he decides to kill him with his belt.\n\n=== Last years ===\nIn 2006, he unsuccessfully attempted to integrate a political party to postulate to Peruvian Presidency.\n\nWhen Media got tired of Poggi, he became a street vendor, singing, talking and selling his books at Parque Kennedy (Kennedy Park), in the [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores district]] (Lima).\n\nOn May 2007, Poggi made a national commotion by bringing to light an alleged journalist's son, [[Jaime Bayly]]. It turned out to be a fiasco (a person merely similar to Bayly, who used Poggi's fame for propaganda).\n\nHe served in the [[Peruvian Nationalist Party]].\n\n=== Issue ===\nPoggi had two children with his first wife, Julia Carmen Manrique: Karla Estela and Lorena.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Flores Seminario | first1 = Ethel | last2 = Poggi Manrique | first2 = Karla | last3 = Acevedo Rios | first3 = Manuel | year = 2006 | title = Cebiches & Tiraditos | location = Lima | publisher = Unimundo | url = http://www.libroslatinos.com/cgi-bin/libros/process/locale/es_ES/page/107513.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061533/http://www.libroslatinos.com/cgi-bin/libros/process/locale/es_ES/page/107513.html | archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Poggi Manrique | first1 = Karla | last2 = Lude\u00f1a de Aliaga | first2 = Yvett | title = Caf\u00e9, 150 maneras de disfrutarlo | language = Spanish | trans-title = Coffee: 150 ways to enjoy it | location = Rome | publisher = Anordest Edizioni | url = http://www.hipernatural.com/es/autor12058hn.html | url-status = dead}}</ref> With his second wife, Nelly Chacaltana, Poggi had more three children: Estefan\u00eda, Patricia and Ra\u00fal Alfonso.

The presumed killer was attributed with the authorship of, at least, seven killings.\n\nOn February 6, 1986, the Lima Police captured a suspect called, \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn (1959\u20131986), a 26-year-old from [[Chincha Alta]].<ref name=\"Caretas\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.caretas.com.pe/2000/1644/articulos/policiales.phtml | title = 50 a\u00f1os de policiales | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320125927/http://www.caretas.com.pe/2000/1644/articulos/policiales.phtml | archive-date= March 20, 2012 | first = Gast\u00f3n | last = Agurto | work = Caretas | date = November 9, 2000}}</ref> In one point during questioning, he stated he began to feel [[Delusional disorder|paranoic]] so the police called Poggi to verify the pathology.\n\nNext Day, Poggi \u2015dressed eccentrically like he used to\u2015 walked in the former headquarter of the ''Caretas'' magazine (at the Caman\u00e1 shred, located at Lima's center) and asked for a meeting with the policial genre writer Jorge Negro Salazar, \u00abVengo de estar con el descuartizador de Lima. Soy Mario Poggi, soy psic\u00f3logo de la PIP, si quieren los llevo para que vean c\u00f3mo hipnotizo al asesino y lo hago confesar sus espantosos cr\u00edmenes (I've been recently with the Lima's dismemberer. I'm Mario Poggi, I'm a psychologist from the PIP. If you want to, I'll take you so you see how I hypnotize the killer and make him confess his terrifying crimes)\u00bb.\n&nbsp;\nSalazar called the Magazine's Photographer, V\u00edctor Ch. Vargas and they went to the former Homicide treatment local, located in Avenida Espa\u00f1a (In English: Spain Avenue). Police treated Poggi calling him \u00abdoctor\u00bb. By Poggi's request, the police took Diaz Balbin handcuffed. (Almost skeletal, suffering a deep famine and with a thickened beard). Poggi began an strange ritual, touching the prisoner's head, who, by the way, didn't produce a single noise. \u00ab\u00a1Eres el descuartizador \u2015gritaba Poggi ahuecando la voz\u2015, aqu\u00ed en el cr\u00e1neo puedo palpar tu inteligencia asesina\u00bb (You're the dismemberer- Poggi screamed while hollowing out his voice- Here, in your skull, I can palpate your murderous intelligence).\n\nOn February 8, ''Caretas'' magazine feature Salazar's article along with the photographs in which Poggi \"was analyzing\" \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn.<ref name=\"Caretas\" /> &nbsp;\nNext Day, On February 9, 1986, Poggi appeared in the Media crying in the Homicide Office: \u00ab\u00a1Salv\u00e9 a la humanidad! \u00a1Acab\u00e9 con el monstruo! (I saved humankind! I finished off the monster!\u00bb. Effectively, Poggi had asked the officer on duty to bring the prisoner with his arms handcuffed to his back. Then he asked for privacy to interview the suspect. According to Poggi, when he was alone with the suspect, he took off his clothes and the suspect's. He tried to cause him sexual excitation, because he wanted to show him how he raped his victims, before killing and dismembering them. Although, D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn didn't respond to his provocations. After an hour, Poggi laid D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn face down (hand-tied and feet-tied). Took out his leather belt with suspect facing down, and strangled him. After killing D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn, he dressed back again and went out of the room he was in. He told the police officers he strangled D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn, because due to his madness, Poggi feared, he could be released and start to kill people again.<ref name=\"Caretas\"/>\n&nbsp;\nEven though, \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn was killed, the dismemberment kept on going .Poggi's Trial was considered a kind of prank on which the accused behaved like comedy showman. When he was questioned during his Trial, Poggi stated he didn't killed him, but, instead, he was blamed for D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn's Death, and said that he- aged 45- was \u00abmuy viejo para matar a ese chico\u00bb (\"too old to kill that young man\") He was sentenced to twelve years in prison, although he only stayed imprisoned for a 1/3 of his actual sentence (4 years and 8 months in the correctional of San Jorge, Lima).\n\n=== Celebrity ===\nIn 1991, Poggi was released from jail. He decided to stay away from psychology after being released. He called himself \"Loco\" (Crazy), and dyed his hair green. He then became a celebrity. He was invited to several programs, many having poor ratings, and many others that looked for a \"bizarre\" introduction or central topic.\n\nIn 1997, Poggi published his autobiography, \"''Yo S\u00f3lo S\u00e9 Que Soy Un Imb\u00e9cil'' (''I Only Know I Am A Moron'')\", in a poor quality format with green letters and recurrent orthographic, typographic, and edition errors\u2015that, according to the publisher, El Siglo, (The Century), was to show respect to the original message\u2015. It consists of an introducing chapter with delusional quotes and some passages of his life \u2015where he mixes popular characters, with Limenian Personalities\u2015, and a final chapter with some of his drawings and some art critics of his sculptures.\n\nIn 2000, Poggi participated in the filming of the movie \"''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo''\" (''My Nude Crime''), by Le\u00f3nidas Zegarra, in which he played himself. The film was released in 2001. The project began in 1998, when a group of film students wanted to bring to the big screen the story of the murder of the serial criminal Angel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn in the hands of psychologist Mario Poggi. Zegarra was invited to participate in the project asthe director. The film's production was financed mainly by loans. The equipment needed was acquired in agreement with a production company. The budget,  like in every movie by Zerraga, was  just $11.000 (equivalent to $16,388.72 as of 2019). Because of that, according to Zegarra, they came to an agreement with the actors and actresses (Mario Poggi, Am\u00e9rico Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Yesabella, Rossi War, V\u00edctor \u00c1ngeles y Wilmer Ato) to pay them when the movie was commercialized, and when they retrieved the money invested. The movie also featured the well-known Peruvian singer [[La Tigresa del Oriente]] (In English: The Eastern Tigress) portraying [[Magaly Medina]], who became famous in the next decade for her music videos on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/blogs/camaleon_con_zapatillas/2009/09/25/la-otra-tigresa-del-oriente-la-felina-que-no-colgo-su-video-en-youtube/|title= La otra Tigresa del Oriente: la felina que no colg\u00f3 su video en Youtube | first = Alfredo | last = P\u00e9rez Andrade | date=September 25, 2008 | language = Spanish | trans-title = The other Eastern Tigress: the feline who did not upload her video on YouTube |publisher=La Rep\u00fablica| url-status = dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712062644/http://larepublica.pe/blogs/camaleon_con_zapatillas/2009/09/25/la-otra-tigresa-del-oriente-la-felina-que-no-colgo-su-video-en-youtube/|archive-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo'' premiered in two Lima cinemas (Exc\u00e9lsior and Tacna). There was no money for the advertising campaign and only the popularity of the vedettes who participated in the film (such as Martha Yesabella V\u00e1squez Ch\u00e1vez) was exploited. There were also exchanges with small newspapers, which published the ads in exchange for tickets to the movies. The investment was not fully recovered and to get out of the debts, a remake was launched with the suggestive name of ''Vedettes Al Desnudo'' (''Nude Vedettes'').\n\nThe movie's story is about the psychotic \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn frightening the city of Lima and killing prostitutes. The police follow his trail and capture him, but D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn resists confessing his crimes. To force him to do so, they call psychologist Mario Poggi, who manages to make him confess. However, Poggi believes that the release of Diaz Balbin is imminent, so he decides to kill him with his belt.\n\n=== Last years ===\nIn 2006, he unsuccessfully attempted to integrate a political party to postulate to Peruvian Presidency.\n\nWhen Media got tired of Poggi, he became a street vendor, singing, talking and selling his books at Parque Kennedy (Kennedy Park), in the [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores district]] (Lima).\n\nOn May 2007, Poggi made a national commotion by bringing to light an alleged journalist's son, [[Jaime Bayly]]. It turned out to be a fiasco (a person merely similar to Bayly, who used Poggi's fame for propaganda).\n\nHe served in the [[Peruvian Nationalist Party]].\n\n=== Issue ===\nPoggi had two children with his first wife, Julia Carmen Manrique: Karla Estela and Lorena.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Flores Seminario | first1 = Ethel | last2 = Poggi Manrique | first2 = Karla | last3 = Acevedo Rios | first3 = Manuel | year = 2006 | title = Cebiches & Tiraditos | location = Lima | publisher = Unimundo | url = http://www.libroslatinos.com/cgi-bin/libros/process/locale/es_ES/page/107513.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061533/http://www.libroslatinos.com/cgi-bin/libros/process/locale/es_ES/page/107513.html | archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Poggi Manrique | first1 = Karla | last2 = Lude\u00f1a de Aliaga | first2 = Yvett | title = Caf\u00e9, 150 maneras de disfrutarlo | language = Spanish | trans-title = Coffee: 150 ways to enjoy it | location = Rome | publisher = Anordest Edizioni | url = http://www.hipernatural.com/es/autor12058hn.html | url-status = dead}}</ref> With his second wife, Nelly Chacaltana, Poggi had more three children: Estefan\u00eda, Patricia and Ra\u00fal Alfonso.

He was taken to the Casimiro Ulloa Hospital, Lima. He died there of another cardiac arrest the next day at noon on February 26, 2016, just five days prior to his 73rd birthday.\n\nHis remains were veiled in the Virgen de F\u00e1tima church in [[Miraflores District, Lima]].\n\n== Works ==\n\n* 1970: Mi Primer Pajazo.

He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident [[George W. Bush]] picked O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be seen as a figure to respect by those on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hope he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[Geroge H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |author1=George W.

He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W.

He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident George W. Bush picked O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be seen as a figure to respect by those on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hope he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father Geroge H. W. Bush had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist Larry Lindsey the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |editor1-last=Desmond |editor1-first=Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-5906 |pages=85-6 |accessdate=14 April 2020 |chapter=3.

It is a proactive method of reducing [[emergencies]] and the [[fire damage|damage]] caused by them. Many fire departments have a Fire Prevention Officer.\n\nIn the general sense of preventing harmful fires, many aspects are discussed in the articles [[Fire protection]] and [[Fire safety]].

Often, the messages and lessons are simple tips. Effective and important lessons and messages include:\n\n===Stop, drop and roll===\n\nIf one's clothing catches on fire, the most effective method of extinguishing the fire is to stop, drop to the ground, and roll back and forth to smother the flame.

For this reason, they are the quickest at getting water on the fire and are the simplest to maintain. Wet pipe systems are installed where indoor temperatures can he maintained at or above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Below that temperature, there is the danger of freezing pipes. If the outside temperature is below freezing and the interior temperature is less than forty degrees Fahrenheit, the steel sprinkler piping, which rapidly conducts heat and rapidly loses it, will drop below freezing. The frozen area may be isolated and near an opening or uninsulated portion of the building. It may be a small area, but it could be enough to put the whole system out of service.\n\n===Don't just leave to do something else===\n\nOne of the most common reasons for fires is how people often leave stoves, ovens, toasters, clothing irons, barbecues, and candles unattended.\n\n===Firefighters are your friends===\n\nOne of the most critical jobs of a firefighter is [[search and rescue]]. For young children, it is important that firefighters are seen as people they can follow and trust. A firefighter in [[bunker gear]] breathing with an [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|air tank]] can be scary. One way a child can get used to or trust a firefighter is seeing a firefighter dress, step by step, seeing that it is a person inside. Furthermore, being able to walk up and touch the firefighter can reassure the child that he or she is a real person.
