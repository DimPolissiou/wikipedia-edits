They crawl across the sea floor using their flexible arms for locomotion. The ophiuroids generally have five long, slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} in length on the largest specimens.  They are also known as serpent stars; the [[New Latin]] class name Ophiuroidea is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u1f44\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2, meaning \"serpent\".\n\nThe Ophiuroidea contain two large [[clade]]s, [[Ophiurida]] (brittle stars) and [[Euryalida]] (basket stars).

The body outline is similar to that of [[Asteroidea|starfish]], in that ophiuroids have five arms joined to a central body disk. However, in ophiuroids, the central body disk is sharply marked off from the arms.<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 957\u2013959|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\nThe disk contains all of the viscera. That is, the internal organs of digestion and reproduction never enter the arms, as they do in the Asteroidea. The underside of the disk contains the mouth, which has five toothed jaws formed from skeletal plates. The [[madreporite]] is usually located within one of the jaw plates, and not on the upper side of the animal as it is in starfish.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe ophiuroid [[coelom]] is strongly reduced, particularly in comparison to other echinoderms.\n\n[[Image:Greenbrittlestar.jpg|thumb|right|Green brittle star - ''Ophiarachna incrassata'']]\n\n===Water-vascular system===\nThe vessels of the [[water vascular system]] end in [[tube feet]]. The water vascular system generally has one madreporite. Others, such as certain Euryalina, have one per arm on the aboral surface.  Still other forms have no madreporite at all. Suckers and [[ampulla]]e are absent from the tube feet.\n\n===Nervous system===\nThe nervous system consists of a main nerve ring which runs around the central disk. At the base of each arm, the ring attaches to a radial nerve which runs to the end of the limb. The nerves in each limb run through a canal at the base of the vertebral ossicles.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nMost ophiuroids have no eyes, or other specialised sense organs. However, they have several types of sensitive nerve endings in their epidermis, and are able to sense chemicals in the water, touch, and even the presence or absence of light.<ref name=IZ/> Moreover, tube feet may sense light as well as odors.  These are especially found at the ends of their arms, detecting light and retreating into crevices.\n\n===Digestion===\nThe mouth is rimmed with five jaws, and serves as an anus ([[egestion]]) as well as a mouth ([[ingestion]]). Behind the jaws is a short esophagus and a stomach cavity which occupies much of the dorsal half of the disk.. Digestion occurs within 10 pouches or infolds of the stomach, which are essentially [[Cecum|ceca]], but unlike in sea stars, almost never extend into the arms.<ref name=IZ/> The stomach wall contains glandular [[hepatic]] cells.\n\nOphiuroids are generally [[scavenger]]s or [[detritivores]]. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Basket stars in particular may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents.\n\nIn [[basket star]]s, the arms are used to rhythmically sweep food to the mouth. ''Pectinura'' consumes [[beech]] [[pollen]] in the [[New Zealand]] fjords (since those trees hang over the water). ''Eurylina'' clings to coral branches to browse on the [[polyps]].\n\n===Respiration===\nGas exchange and excretion occur through cilia-lined sacs called bursae; each opens between the arm bases on the underside of the disk. Typically ten bursae are found, and each fits between two stomach digestive pouches. Water flows through the bursae by means of [[cilia]] or muscular contraction. Oxygen is transported through the body by the '''hemal system''', a series of sinuses and vessels distinct from the water vascular system.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe bursae are probably also the main organs of excretion, with [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] \"coelomocytes\" collecting waste products in the body cavity and then migrating to the bursae for expulsion from the body.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Musculoskeletal system===\n[[File:Expl2319 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A field of the [[soft coral]] [[Callogorgia|''Callogorgia sp.'']] with its brittle star [[symbiont]]s]]\n\nLike all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea possess a skeleton of [[calcium carbonate]] in the form of [[calcite]].  In ophiuroids, the calcite ossicles are fused to form armor plates which are known collectively as the ''test''. The plates are covered by the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], which consists of a smooth [[syncytium]]. In most species, the joints between the ossicles and superficial plates allow the arm to bend to the side, but not to bend upwards. However, in the [[basket star]]s, the arms are flexible in all directions.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nBoth the Ophiurida and Euryalida (the basket stars) have five long, slender, flexible, whip-like arms, up to 60&nbsp;cm in length. They are supported by an internal skeleton of calcium carbonate plates referred to as vertebral ossicles. These \"vertebrae\" articulate by means of ball-in-socket joints, and are controlled by muscles. They are essentially fused plates which correspond to the parallel ambulacral plates in sea stars and five Paleozoic families of ophiuroids.  In modern forms, the vertebrae occur along the median of the arm.\n\nThe ossicles are surrounded by a relatively thin ring of soft tissue, and then by four series of jointed plates, one each on the upper, lower, and lateral surfaces of the arm. The two lateral plates often have a number of elongated spines projecting outwards; these help to provide traction against the substrate while the animal is moving. The spines, in ophiuroids, compose a rigid border to the arm edges, whereas in euryalids they are transformed into downward-facing clubs or hooklets.  Euryalids are similar to ophiurids, if larger, but their arms are forked and branched. Ophiuroid podia generally function as sensory organs. They are not usually used for feeding, as in Asteroidea. In the Paleozoic era, brittle stars had open ambulacral grooves, but in modern forms, these are turned inward.\n\nIn living ophiuroids, the vertebrae are linked by well-structured longitudinal muscles.  Ophiuroida move horizontally, and ''Euryalina'' species move vertically.  The latter have bigger vertebrae and smaller muscles.  They are less spasmodic, but can coil their arms around objects, holding even after death.  These movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, separating them.  Ophiuroida move quickly when disturbed.  One arm presses ahead, whereas the other four act as two pairs of opposite levers, thrusting the body in a series of rapid jerks.  Although adults do not use their tube feet for locomotion, very young stages use them as stilts and even serve as an adhesive structure.\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe sexes are separate in most species, though a few are hermaphroditic or [[protandry|protandric]]. The [[gonad]]s are located in the disk, and open into pouches between the arms, called genital bursae.  Fertilisation is external in most species, with the [[gamete]]s being shed into the surrounding water through the bursal sacs.<ref name=IZ/> An exception is the Ophiocanopidae, in which the gonads do not open into bursae and are instead paired in a chain along the basal arm joints.\n\nMany species brood developing larvae in the bursae, effectively giving birth to live young. A few, such as ''[[Amphipholus squamata]]'', are truly [[viviparous]], with the embryo receiving nourishment from the mother through the wall of the bursa. However, some species do not brood their young, and instead have a free-swimming larval stage. Referred to as an '''ophiopluteus''', these larvae have four pairs of rigid arms lined with [[cilia]]. They develop directly into an adult, without the attachment stage found in most starfish larvae.<ref name=IZ/> The number of species exhibiting ophiopluteus larvae are fewer than those that directly develop.\n\nIn a few species, the female carries a dwarf male, clinging to it with the mouth.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Fission===\nSome brittle stars, such as the six-armed members of the family [[Ophiactidae]], exhibit fissiparity (division though fission), with the disk splitting in half. Regrowth of both the lost part of the disk and the arms occur<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGovern|first=Tamara M.|date=2002-04-05|title=Patterns of sexual and asexual reproduction in the brittle star ''Ophiactis savignyi'' in the Florida Keys|url=https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2002/230/m230p119.pdf|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=230|pages=119\u2013126|doi=10.3354/meps230119|accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> which yields an animal with three large arms and three small arms during the period of growth.\n\nThe West Indian brittle star, ''[[Ophiocomella ophiactoides]]'', frequently undergoes [[asexual reproduction]] by fission of the disk with subsequent regeneration of the arms. In both summer and winter, large numbers of individuals with three long arms and three short arms can be found. Other individuals have half a disk and only three arms. A study of the age range of the population indicates.           little recruitment and fission is the primary means of reproduction in this species.<ref name=\"OO\">{{cite journal|author=Mladenov, Philip V.|author2=Roland H.

This deepens and widens until it extends across the disk and the animal splits in two. New arms begin to grow before the fission is complete, thus minimizing the time between possible successive divisions. The plane of fission varies so that some newly formed individuals have existing arms of different lengths. The time period between successive divisions is 89 days, so theoretically, each brittle star can produce 15 new individuals during the course of a year.<ref name=\"OO\" />\n\n===Life span===\nBrittle stars generally sexually mature in two to three years, become full grown in three to four years, and live up to 5 years. {{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Members of [[Euryalina]], such as ''[[Gorgonocephalus]]'', may live much longer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Regeneration===\n[[image:Ofiuroanemona.jpg|thumb|An ''[[Ophiothrix fragilis]]'' brittle star with missing arm segments from [[P\u00f3voa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]]]]\nOphiuroids can readily [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] lost arms or arm segments unless all arms are lost. Ophiuroids use this ability [[anti-predator adaptation|to escape predators]], in a way similar to lizards [[autotomy|which deliberately shed]] the distal part of their tails to confuse pursuers.  Moreover, the Amphiuridae can regenerate gut and gonad fragments lost along with the arms.  Discarded arms have not been shown to have the ability to regenerate.\n\n[[Image:Brittlestar.Mgiangrasso.jpg|thumb|Micro brittle starfish and ''[[Caulerpa]] racemosa'']]\n\n==Locomotion==\nBrittle stars use their arms for locomotion. Brittle stars move fairly rapidly by wriggling their arms which are highly flexible and enable the animals to make either snake-like or rowing movements.  However, they tend to attach themselves to the sea floor or to sponges or cnidarians, such as coral.  \nThey move as if they were bilaterally symmetrical, with an arbitrary leg selected as the symmetry axis and the other four used in propulsion. The axial leg may be facing or trailing the direction of motion, and due to the radially symmetrical nervous system, can be changed whenever a change in direction is necessary.<ref name=\"ref_\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Astley | first1 = H.

Both shallow-water and deep-sea species of brittle stars are known to produce light. Presumably, this light is used to deter predators.\n\n==Ecology==\nBrittle stars live in areas from the low-tide level downwards.  Six families live at least 2 m deep; the genera ''Ophiura'', ''Amphiophiura'', and ''Ophiacantha'' range below 4 m.  Shallow species live among sponges, stones, or coral, or under the sand or mud, with only their arms protruding.  Two of the best-known shallow species are the green brittle star (''Ophioderma brevispina''), found from Massachusetts to Brazil, and the common European brittle star (''[[Ophiothrix fragilis]]'').  Deep-water species tend to live in or on the sea floor or adhere to coral or urchins.  The most widespread species is the long-armed brittle star (''Amphipholis squamata''), a grayish or bluish, strongly luminescent species.\n\n===Parasites===\nThe main parasite to enter the digestive tract or genitals are protozoans. Crustaceans, nematodes, trematodes, and polychaete annelids also serve as parasites.  Algal parasites such as ''[[Coccomyxa ophiurae]]'' cause spinal malformation.  Unlike in sea stars and sea urchins, annelids are not typical parasites.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Diversity and taxonomy ==\n{{see also|List of prehistoric brittle stars|List of echinodermata orders}}\n[[File:Haeckel Ophiodea.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate of brittle stars from the ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'' from [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Haeckel Ophiodea 70.jpg|thumb|upright|Second plate of brittle stars from Haeckel]]\nBetween {{formatnum:2064}}<ref name=\"Mah Diversity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.echinoblog.blogspot.fr/2014/01/brittle-star-diversity-how-many-are.html |title=Brittle Star Diversity!

They crawl across the sea floor using their flexible arms for locomotion. The ophiuroids generally have five long, slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} in length on the largest specimens.  They are also known as serpent stars; the [[New Latin]] class name Ophiuroidea is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u1f44\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2, meaning \"serpent\".\n\nThe Ophiuroidea contain two large [[clade]]s, [[Ophiurida]] (brittle stars) and [[Euryalida]] (basket stars).

The body outline is similar to that of [[Asteroidea|starfish]], in that ophiuroids have five arms joined to a central body disk. However, in ophiuroids, the central body disk is sharply marked off from the arms.<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 957\u2013959|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\nThe disk contains all of the viscera. That is, the internal organs of digestion and reproduction never enter the arms, as they do in the Asteroidea. The underside of the disk contains the mouth, which has five toothed jaws formed from skeletal plates. The [[madreporite]] is usually located within one of the jaw plates, and not on the upper side of the animal as it is in starfish.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe ophiuroid [[coelom]] is strongly reduced, particularly in comparison to other echinoderms.\n\n[[Image:Greenbrittlestar.jpg|thumb|right|Green brittle star - ''Ophiarachna incrassata'']]\n\n===Water-vascular system===\nThe vessels of the [[water vascular system]] end in [[tube feet]]. The water vascular system generally has one madreporite. Others, such as certain Euryalina, have one per arm on the aboral surface.  Still other forms have no madreporite at all. Suckers and [[ampulla]]e are absent from the tube feet.\n\n===Nervous system===\nThe nervous system consists of a main nerve ring which runs around the central disk. At the base of each arm, the ring attaches to a radial nerve which runs to the end of the limb. The nerves in each limb run through a canal at the base of the vertebral ossicles.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nMost ophiuroids have no eyes, or other specialised sense organs. However, they have several types of sensitive nerve endings in their epidermis, and are able to sense chemicals in the water, touch, and even the presence or absence of light.<ref name=IZ/> Moreover, tube feet may sense light as well as odors.  These are especially found at the ends of their arms, detecting light and retreating into crevices.\n\n===Digestion===\nThe mouth is rimmed with five jaws, and serves as an anus ([[egestion]]) as well as a mouth ([[ingestion]]). Behind the jaws is a short esophagus and a stomach cavity which occupies much of the dorsal half of the disk.. Digestion occurs within 10 pouches or infolds of the stomach, which are essentially [[Cecum|ceca]], but unlike in sea stars, almost never extend into the arms.<ref name=IZ/> The stomach wall contains glandular [[hepatic]] cells.\n\nOphiuroids are generally [[scavenger]]s or [[detritivores]]. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Basket stars in particular may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents.\n\nIn [[basket star]]s, the arms are used to rhythmically sweep food to the mouth. ''Pectinura'' consumes [[beech]] [[pollen]] in the [[New Zealand]] fjords (since those trees hang over the water). ''Eurylina'' clings to coral branches to browse on the [[polyps]].\n\n===Respiration===\nGas exchange and excretion occur through cilia-lined sacs called bursae; each opens between the arm bases on the underside of the disk. Typically ten bursae are found, and each fits between two stomach digestive pouches. Water flows through the bursae by means of [[cilia]] or muscular contraction. Oxygen is transported through the body by the '''hemal system''', a series of sinuses and vessels distinct from the water vascular system.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nThe bursae are probably also the main organs of excretion, with [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] \"coelomocytes\" collecting waste products in the body cavity and then migrating to the bursae for expulsion from the body.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Musculoskeletal system===\n[[File:Expl2319 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A field of the [[soft coral]] [[Callogorgia|''Callogorgia sp.'']] with its brittle star [[symbiont]]s]]\n\nLike all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea possess a skeleton of [[calcium carbonate]] in the form of [[calcite]].  In ophiuroids, the calcite ossicles are fused to form armor plates which are known collectively as the ''test''. The plates are covered by the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], which consists of a smooth [[syncytium]]. In most species, the joints between the ossicles and superficial plates allow the arm to bend to the side, but not to bend upwards. However, in the [[basket star]]s, the arms are flexible in all directions.<ref name=IZ/>\n\nBoth the Ophiurida and Euryalida (the basket stars) have five long, slender, flexible, whip-like arms, up to 60&nbsp;cm in length. They are supported by an internal skeleton of calcium carbonate plates referred to as vertebral ossicles. These \"vertebrae\" articulate by means of ball-in-socket joints, and are controlled by muscles. They are essentially fused plates which correspond to the parallel ambulacral plates in sea stars and five Paleozoic families of ophiuroids.  In modern forms, the vertebrae occur along the median of the arm.\n\nThe ossicles are surrounded by a relatively thin ring of soft tissue, and then by four series of jointed plates, one each on the upper, lower, and lateral surfaces of the arm. The two lateral plates often have a number of elongated spines projecting outwards; these help to provide traction against the substrate while the animal is moving. The spines, in ophiuroids, compose a rigid border to the arm edges, whereas in euryalids they are transformed into downward-facing clubs or hooklets.  Euryalids are similar to ophiurids, if larger, but their arms are forked and branched. Ophiuroid podia generally function as sensory organs. They are not usually used for feeding, as in Asteroidea. In the Paleozoic era, brittle stars had open ambulacral grooves, but in modern forms, these are turned inward.\n\nIn living ophiuroids, the vertebrae are linked by well-structured longitudinal muscles.  Ophiuroida move horizontally, and ''Euryalina'' species move vertically.  The latter have bigger vertebrae and smaller muscles.  They are less spasmodic, but can coil their arms around objects, holding even after death.  These movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, separating them.  Ophiuroida move quickly when disturbed.  One arm presses ahead, whereas the other four act as two pairs of opposite levers, thrusting the body in a series of rapid jerks.  Although adults do not use their tube feet for locomotion, very young stages use them as stilts and even serve as an adhesive structure.\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe sexes are separate in most species, though a few are hermaphroditic or [[protandry|protandric]]. The [[gonad]]s are located in the disk, and open into pouches between the arms, called genital bursae.  Fertilisation is external in most species, with the [[gamete]]s being shed into the surrounding water through the bursal sacs.<ref name=IZ/> An exception is the Ophiocanopidae, in which the gonads do not open into bursae and are instead paired in a chain along the basal arm joints.\n\nMany species brood developing larvae in the bursae, effectively giving birth to live young. A few, such as ''[[Amphipholus squamata]]'', are truly [[viviparous]], with the embryo receiving nourishment from the mother through the wall of the bursa. However, some species do not brood their young, and instead have a free-swimming larval stage. Referred to as an '''ophiopluteus''', these larvae have four pairs of rigid arms lined with [[cilia]]. They develop directly into an adult, without the attachment stage found in most starfish larvae.<ref name=IZ/> The number of species exhibiting ophiopluteus larvae are fewer than those that directly develop.\n\nIn a few species, the female carries a dwarf male, clinging to it with the mouth.<ref name=IZ/>\n\n===Fission===\nSome brittle stars, such as the six-armed members of the family [[Ophiactidae]], exhibit fissiparity (division though fission), with the disk splitting in half. Regrowth of both the lost part of the disk and the arms occur<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGovern|first=Tamara M.|date=2002-04-05|title=Patterns of sexual and asexual reproduction in the brittle star ''Ophiactis savignyi'' in the Florida Keys|url=https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2002/230/m230p119.pdf|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=230|pages=119\u2013126|doi=10.3354/meps230119|accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> which yields an animal with three large arms and three small arms during the period of growth.\n\nThe West Indian brittle star, ''[[Ophiocomella ophiactoides]]'', frequently undergoes [[asexual reproduction]] by fission of the disk with subsequent regeneration of the arms. In both summer and winter, large numbers of individuals with three long arms and three short arms can be found. Other individuals have half a disk and only three arms. A study of the age range of the population indicates little recruitment and fission is the primary means of reproduction in this species.<ref name=\"OO\">{{cite journal|author=Mladenov, Philip V.|author2=Roland H. Emson|author3=Lori V. Colpit|author4=Iain C. Wilkie|year=1983|title=Asexual reproduction in the west Indian brittle star ''Ophiocomella ophiactoides'' (H.L.

This deepens and widens until it extends across the disk and the animal splits in two. New arms begin to grow before the fission is complete, thus minimizing the time between possible successive divisions. The plane of fission varies so that some newly formed individuals have existing arms of different lengths. The time period between successive divisions is 89 days, so theoretically, each brittle star can produce 15 new individuals during the course of a year.<ref name=\"OO\" />\n\n===Life span===\nBrittle stars generally sexually mature in two to three years, become full grown in three to four years, and live up to 5 years. {{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Members of [[Euryalina]], such as ''[[Gorgonocephalus]]'', may live much longer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Regeneration===\n[[image:Ofiuroanemona.jpg|thumb|An ''[[Ophiothrix fragilis]]'' brittle star with missing arm segments from [[P\u00f3voa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]]]]\nOphiuroids can readily [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] lost arms or arm segments unless all arms are lost. Ophiuroids use this ability [[anti-predator adaptation|to escape predators]], in a way similar to lizards [[autotomy|which deliberately shed]] the distal part of their tails to confuse pursuers.  Moreover, the Amphiuridae can regenerate gut and gonad fragments lost along with the arms.  Discarded arms have not been shown to have the ability to regenerate.\n\n[[Image:Brittlestar.Mgiangrasso.jpg|thumb|Micro brittle starfish and ''[[Caulerpa]] racemosa'']]\n\n==Locomotion==\nBrittle stars use their arms for locomotion. Brittle stars move fairly rapidly by wriggling their arms which are highly flexible and enable the animals to make either snake-like or rowing movements.  However, they tend to attach themselves to the sea floor or to sponges or cnidarians, such as coral.  \nThey move as if they were bilaterally symmetrical, with an arbitrary leg selected as the symmetry axis and the other four used in propulsion. The axial leg may be facing or trailing the direction of motion, and due to the radially symmetrical nervous system, can be changed whenever a change in direction is necessary.<ref name=\"ref_\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Astley | first1 = H.

Both shallow-water and deep-sea species of brittle stars are known to produce light. Presumably, this light is used to deter predators.\n\n==Ecology==\nBrittle stars live in areas from the low-tide level downwards.  Six families live at least 2 m deep; the genera ''Ophiura'', ''Amphiophiura'', and ''Ophiacantha'' range below 4 m.  Shallow species live among sponges, stones, or coral, or under the sand or mud, with only their arms protruding.  Two of the best-known shallow species are the green brittle star (''Ophioderma brevispina''), found from Massachusetts to Brazil, and the common European brittle star (''[[Ophiothrix fragilis]]'').  Deep-water species tend to live in or on the sea floor or adhere to coral or urchins.  The most widespread species is the long-armed brittle star (''Amphipholis squamata''), a grayish or bluish, strongly luminescent species.\n\n===Parasites===\nThe main parasite to enter the digestive tract or genitals are protozoans. Crustaceans, nematodes, trematodes, and polychaete annelids also serve as parasites.  Algal parasites such as ''[[Coccomyxa ophiurae]]'' cause spinal malformation.  Unlike in sea stars and sea urchins, annelids are not typical parasites.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Diversity and taxonomy ==\n{{see also|List of prehistoric brittle stars|List of echinodermata orders}}\n[[File:Haeckel Ophiodea.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate of brittle stars from the ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'' from [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Haeckel Ophiodea 70.jpg|thumb|upright|Second plate of brittle stars from Haeckel]]\nBetween {{formatnum:2064}}<ref name=\"Mah Diversity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.echinoblog.blogspot.fr/2014/01/brittle-star-diversity-how-many-are.html |title=Brittle Star Diversity!

Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasised the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of [[joint lock]]s application. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art,<ref name=rules>[http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf \"IBJJF rules\"] ([[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]]), accessed April 3, 2008</ref> although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including emphasis on full-contact fighting.\n\nBJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground.

On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.\n\nBJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as \"[[Guard (grappling)#Pulling Guard|pulling guard]]\", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with [[side control]], [[Mount (grappling)|mount]], and [[back mount]] positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/ex-navy-seal-commander-heres-why-so-many-smart-people-practicebrazilian-jiu-jitsu.html|title=Ex-Navy SEAL commander: Here's why so many smart people practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=5 December 2018|website=Cnbc.com}}</ref> A submission hold in BJJ is often assimilated to the equivalent of \"checkmate\", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.\n\n[[Renzo Gracie]] wrote in his book ''Mastering JUJITSU'':\n\n{{quote|\"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant over the course of a fight.

Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.\n\n=== Ground fighting ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Demonstration.ogv|thumb|right|A demonstration of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during a class at Standard BJJ in Rockville, MD.]]\nBJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], although it employs some basic [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], such as [[Single leg takedown|single]] and [[double leg takedown]]s, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners [[cross-training|cross train]] with [[wrestling]], judo, and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]].\n\n=== Training methods ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens camaraderie, build trust at Camp Lemonnier 140727-F-SJ695-033.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor gently demonstrates how to tackle an opponent.]]\nBJJ focuses on submissions without the use of [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort used in competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.\n\nThe [[Gracie family]] lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlW9dmsPJs Carlos Sr. vs Helio: The Truth About the Gracie Family History and Politics ] Kama Jiu-Jitsu, August 14, 2017</ref> They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques.

These positions provide different submission or transition options.\n\n=== Side control ===\n{{Main|Side control}}\n[[File:Udegarami.JPG|thumb|An \"americana\" or \"paintbrush\" submission from traditional [[side control]]]]\n\nIn side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by [[Eddie Bravo]]), Brazilian Crossbody, [[kesa gatame]], \"Wrestler Pin\", knee mount, and other positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Cross-Body Pins|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-jiu-jitsu-positions-cross-body-pins.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Full mount ===\n{{Main|Mount (grappling)}}\n[[File:Andrea Galvao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount (grappling)|Full Mount]] is considered one of the most dominant [[grappling position]]s.]]\n\nIn the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.\n\n=== Back mount ===\n{{Main|Back mount}}\n[[File:Back mount.jpg|thumb|Back mount, also considered one of the most dominant positions in BJJ]]\n\nWhen taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the ''back grab'' or ''attacking the back''), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf |title=International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation \u2013 Rule Book |work =Official IFBJJ rules, see Article 5 \u2013 Fighting Conclusions, The order of the referee, subsection \u2013 E |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply [[chokeholds]], as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.\n\n=== North South position ===\nThe North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as ''deadweight''. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South [[Kimura lock|kimura]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bjj-world.com/bjj-north-south-position-attacks/|title=Versatile Attacks From The BJJ North-South Position|first=Ognen|last=Dzabirski|date=26 March 2018|website=Bjj-world.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{Main|Guard (grappling)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-jitsu-Closed guard.jpg|thumb|left|The Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in blue is demonstrating a type of closed [[Guard (grappling)|guard]]]]\n\nWhen in the \"Guard\" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.\n\nThe three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.\n\nIn closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.\n\nThere are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by [[Keenan Cornelius]]) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.\n\nIn the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions.  There is also a variant of half guard called \"50/50 guard\", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.\n\nAnother variation of the half guard position is the \"deep half guard\", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, [[Jeff Glover]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wbbjj.com/uncle-richard-guard/|title=Having Problems Understanding Deep Half Guard? Jeff Glover Presents \"Uncle Richard Guard\".|date=2017-04-13|work=White Belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Submissions ==\n\n{{For|a list of list of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques|List of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques}}\n\nThe majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: [[joint lock]]s and [[chokehold|chokes]]. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion.<ref name=\"mma\"/> Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by [[Submission (combat sport)|tapping]]. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.\n\n=== Compression locks ===\n\n''See also'' [[Compression lock]]\n\nA less common type of submission hold is a [[compression lock]], where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the [[Compression lock#Achilles lock|Achilles lock]], [[Compression lock#Biceps slicer|Bicep slicer]], and [[Compression lock#Leg slicer|Leg slicer]] (or Calf slicer).\n\n=== Joint locks ===\n[[File:In-guard armbar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A practitioner attempting an [[armbar]] submission]]\n\nWhile many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, [[Neck Crank|joint manipulations of the spine]] are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning [[cervical vertebrae]]. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the \"banana split\" from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow [[heel hooks]], which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous.<ref name=USGR/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Pearch |url=http://www.couch2cage.com/taboo-techniques-the-heel-hook-in-bjj-and-mma/ |title=Taboo techniques |website=Couch2cage.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.\n\nJoint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjjtech.com/tech/tech-list.asp?id=3&sub=y&name=Submissions|title=BJJ Technique Catalog: Category: Submissions|work=bjjtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Chokes ===\n[[File:MCMAP Rear choke - Defense Visual Information Center 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[rear naked choke]], as demonstrated by a [[MCMAP]] instructor]]\n[[Chokehold|Chokes]] are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the [[carotid]] arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve [[baroreceptor]]s in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3\u20135 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the [[windpipe]]) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.\n\nChokes include [[rear-naked choke]], [[Sankaku-jime|triangle]], [[Okuri eri jime|bow and arrow choke]], [[Sode guruma jime|sleeve choke]] (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), [[Kata juji jime#variants|baseball choke]], D'Arce, clock choke, [[Arm triangle choke]], north\u2013south choke, crucifix choke, anaconda choke, [[Gogoplata]], loop choke, and others.\n\n== Uniform ==\n{{Main|Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms ''[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi|gi]]'' or ''[[kimono]]'') is similar to a [[judogi]], but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|promoted]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of \"no-gi\" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., [[Rolles Gracie]] awarding [[Rashad Evans]] a black belt) has become more common.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Grading ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Black belt grades<br />(19 and over)\n|-\n|| Black 0\u20136 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ BlackBelt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Black/Red 7 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ black red belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red/White 8 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ red white belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red 9\u201310 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Red Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Senior belt colors<br />(16 and over)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"brackground:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Blue || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Blue Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Purple || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Purple Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Brown || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Brown Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Junior belt colours<br />(16 and under)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Grey || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Grey Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Yellow Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Orange || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Orange Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Green || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Green Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{{Main|Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|Gracie jiu-jitsu ranking system}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the [[Judo#Rank and grading|judo ranking system]] and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\">\n{{cite web |author=Camargo, Bruno |title= IBJJF Graduation system|url=http://www.ibjjf.org/graduation.htm |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gracie1\">{{cite book| last = Gracie| first = Renzo | authorlink =Renzo Gracie | last2 =Gracie | first2 =Royler | author2-link =Royler Gracie| title = Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique| publisher = Invisible Cities Press Llc| year = 2001\n| page = 304| isbn =1-931229-08-2 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\"/><ref name=\"Gracie1\"/> Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.\n\nUnlike in some martial arts such as [[taekwondo]] and [[karate]], a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/16-jiu-jitsu-practitioners-that-were-promoted-straight-to-black-belt/ | title =16 Jiu-Jitsu Practitioners That Were Promoted Straight to Black Belt | date = 2015-10-14 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/top-10-fastest-black-belt-promotions-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-history/ |last=Guillaume| first=Huni| title =Top 10 Fastest Black Belt Promotions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu History | date = 2015-09-10 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[F\u00e1bio Santos (fighter)|F\u00e1bio Santos]] | title =Passion makes him a champion | medium = | publisher = | location = | date =| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnnoBncArw&t=42s}}</ref> However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] and [[Carlos Gracie]]) has stated that the average of 10\u201312 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the [[ego (Freudian)|ego]] of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =Ryron Gracie | title =Ryron Gracie of the legendary Gracie Clan | medium = | publisher =plugonetwo.com | location =[[Beverly Hills, California]] | date =March 2014| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYQcRfhLCw&t=22m10s}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Federations ==\nSince its inception in Brazil, Jiu-Jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first Jiu-Jitsu Federation was the [[Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara]], which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making Jiu-Jitsu an [[Olympic sport]], and the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]], a profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments.<ref name=ibjjf>{{Cite web |url=https://ibjjf.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115181958/https://ibjjf.com/ |archive-date=2019-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Tournaments ==\nWhile there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles.  First, is the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments.  Second, is the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the [[Pan-American Championship (jiu-jitsu)|Pan American Championship]], [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]], and the [[Mundials]]. [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]] are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.  Other promotions within [[North America]], such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and [[North American Grappling Association]] (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.\n\nAnother tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] creator and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grandmaster [[Rorion Gracie]]. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems\n\nIn 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, \"Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of Jiu-Jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.\" Cheating in Jiu-Jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. \"[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,\" Rose said. \"That's not Jiu-Jitsu. That's cheating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/loretta_hunt/01/25/rose-gracie/ |title=Rose Gracie honors MMA roots with overhaul of Gracie U.S. Nationals \u2013 Loretta Hunt \u2013 SI.com |website=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThis discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread. [[Metamoris]], a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother [[Ralek Gracie]], has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI ([[Eddie Bravo Invitational]]), which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/polaris-3-the-aftermath/ |title=Polaris Pro - The Aftermath - Attack The Back |website=Attacktheback.com |date= 2016-04-03|accessdate=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt tournaments, especially those hosted by the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], some athletes engage in a practice called \"closing out.\"<ref name=\"graciemag.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.graciemag.com/en/2012/04/09/a-measure-for-quashing-closing-out-jiu-jitsu-finals/ |title = A measure for quashing closing out Jiu-Jitsu finals? &#124; Graciemag}}</ref> This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus \"Buchecha\" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/buchecha-surrenders-title-leandro-lo-plus-results-worlds-2018/ | title=Buchecha Surrenders Title to Leandro Lo - Plus More Results from WORLDS 2018| date=2018-06-04}}</ref> and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.<ref>https://www.flograppling.com/articles/5050610-how-the-miyao-brothers-embraced-the-bjj-lifestyle</ref> \nProponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed,<ref name=\"graciemag.com\"/> and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWuBHBAVJJ/</ref>\n\n== Health considerations ==\n=== Safety ===\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scoggin|first1=James F.|last2=Brusovanik|first2=Georgiy|last3=Izuka|first3=Byron H.|last4=Zandee van Rilland|first4=Eddy|last5=Geling|first5=Olga|last6=Tokumura|first6=Seren|title=Assessment of Injuries During Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competition|journal=Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=232596711452218|doi=10.1177/2325967114522184|pmid=26535299|pmc=4555620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreiswirth|first1=Ethan M.|last2=Myer|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Rauh|first3=Mitchell J.|title=Incidence of Injury Among Male Brazilian Jiujitsu Fighters at the World Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi Championship 2009|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=January 2014|volume=49|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.1.11|pmc=3917302|pmid=24377959}}</ref> This is lower than in [[mixed martial arts]] (236-286 per 1000), [[boxing]] (210-420 per 1000), [[judo]] (25.3-130.6) and [[taekwondo]] (20.5-139.5). It is similar to [[wrestling]], which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners suffer from are [[ACL tear]]s in the knees, [[rotator cuff]] tears in the shoulders and [[spinal disc hernia]]tions, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist [[tendonitis]], due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.\n\n=== Skin health ===\nBesides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions.  They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |title=BJJ Safety |website=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108182804/http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}</ref>  Several commonly contracted skin diseases include [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]], [[impetigo]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplersquest.com/blogs/briancimins/grappling-tournament-health-warning-advisory-dirty-mats-nearly-caused-amputation-2 |title=Grappling Tournament Health Warning Advisory \u2013 Dirty Mats nearly caused AMPUTATION in 2009!!! |publisher=Grapplers Quest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with [[soap]], disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]/[[rashguard]]/[[Wrestling headgear|headgear]] used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a [[barrier cream]] greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.\n\n=== Cauliflower ear ===\n[[File:Dom Cruz 2.png|thumb|Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears]]\n\nDue to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in Jiu-Jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell.  Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the [[perichondrium]] that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed ([[cauliflower ear]]). [[Wrestling headgear]] is sometimes used for prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplearts.com/Cauliflower-Ears-In-Brazilian-jiu-jitsu.html |title=Cauliflower ears in Grappling |website=Grapplearts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\nThe practice of taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including [[Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|anabolic steroids]], is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of Jiu-Jitsu's top competitors, including [[Rodrigo Medeiros|Comprido]] and [[Caio Terra]].<ref>{{cite web |author=: Equipe Brasa : : Brasa team : Brazilian Jiu Jitu |url=http://brasa.brazilianblackbelt.com/2011/05/comprido-felipe-costa-and-caio-terra-united-against-steroids-in-bjj/ |title=Black belts united against steroids in BJJ.

Gracie's account of the events is that his sibling [[H\u00e9lio Gracie]] gradually further developed Gracie Jiu-Jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation from Judo that focused more on the ground fighting aspect than the throws, since he was unable to perform many judo moves that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength.<ref name=\"Gracie History | Gracie Academy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracieacademy.com/history.asp |title=Gracie History |publisher=Gracie Academy |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://global-training-report.com/myths.htm|title=Top 30 Myths and Misconceptions about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu |website=Global-training-report.com |quote=Every aspect of early modern BJJ was already being trained and taught as early as 1905 in the USA and England. |access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Gracie family]] is typically recognized as the main family to first promote Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as it is known today, there was also another prominent lineage derived from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple, [[Luiz Fran\u00e7a]].<ref name=\"equipemestrewilson\">{{cite web |website=Equipemestrewilson.com|url=http://equipemestrewilson.com/mitsuyo-maeda/?lang=pt |title=Mitsuyo Maeda & Luiz Fran\u00e7a |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222121/http://equipemestrewilson.com/mitsuyo-maeda/?lang=pt |archive-date=October 4, 2013 |access-date=August 15, 2013 |language=pt}}</ref> This lineage had been represented particularly by [[Oswaldo Fadda]].

Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasised the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of [[joint lock]]s application. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art,<ref name=rules>[http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf \"IBJJF rules\"] ([[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]]), accessed April 3, 2008</ref> although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including emphasis on full-contact fighting.\n\nBJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground. These include judo's scoring [[throw (grappling)|throws]] as well as judo's non-scoring techniques that it refers to as \"skillful takedowns\" (such as the [[flying armbar]]). BJJ also allows any and all takedowns used in wrestling, sambo, or any other grappling arts including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs.

On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.\n\nBJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as \"[[Guard (grappling)#Pulling Guard|pulling guard]]\", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with [[side control]], [[Mount (grappling)|mount]], and [[back mount]] positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/ex-navy-seal-commander-heres-why-so-many-smart-people-practicebrazilian-jiu-jitsu.html|title=Ex-Navy SEAL commander: Here's why so many smart people practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=5 December 2018|website=Cnbc.com}}</ref> A submission hold in BJJ is often assimilated to the equivalent of \"checkmate\", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.\n\n[[Renzo Gracie]] wrote in his book ''Mastering JUJITSU'':\n\n{{quote|\"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant over the course of a fight. Indeed, this was one of Kano's most fundamental and perceptive criticisms of the classical program.\" Maeda not only taught the art of judo to [[Carlos Gracie]], but also taught a particular philosophy about the nature of combat developed by Kano, and further refined by Maeda based on his worldwide travels competing against fighters skilled in a wide variety of martial arts.<ref name=\"renzog1\">{{cite book\n| last = Gracie\n| first = Renzo\n| authorlink =\n| title = Mastering Jiu-jitsu\n| publisher = Human Kinetics\n| year = 2003\n| pages = 1\u2013233\n| isbn = 0-7360-4404-3\n}}</ref>}}\n\nThe book details Maeda's theory as arguing that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, etc. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat best suited to his own strengths. Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.\n\n=== Ground fighting ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Demonstration.ogv|thumb|right|A demonstration of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during a class at Standard BJJ in Rockville, MD.]]\nBJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], although it employs some basic [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], such as [[Single leg takedown|single]] and [[double leg takedown]]s, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners [[cross-training|cross train]] with [[wrestling]], judo, and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]].\n\n=== Training methods ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens camaraderie, build trust at Camp Lemonnier 140727-F-SJ695-033.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor gently demonstrates how to tackle an opponent.]]\nBJJ focuses on submissions without the use of [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort used in competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.\n\nThe [[Gracie family]] lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlW9dmsPJs Carlos Sr. vs Helio: The Truth About the Gracie Family History and Politics ] Kama Jiu-Jitsu, August 14, 2017</ref> They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques.

These positions provide different submission or transition options.\n\n=== Side control ===\n{{Main|Side control}}\n[[File:Udegarami.JPG|thumb|An \"americana\" or \"paintbrush\" submission from traditional [[side control]]]]\n\nIn side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by [[Eddie Bravo]]), Brazilian Crossbody, [[kesa gatame]], \"Wrestler Pin\", knee mount, and other positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Cross-Body Pins|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-jiu-jitsu-positions-cross-body-pins.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Full mount ===\n{{Main|Mount (grappling)}}\n[[File:Andrea Galvao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount (grappling)|Full Mount]] is considered one of the most dominant [[grappling position]]s.]]\n\nIn the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.\n\n=== Back mount ===\n{{Main|Back mount}}\n[[File:Back mount.jpg|thumb|Back mount, also considered one of the most dominant positions in BJJ]]\n\nWhen taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the ''back grab'' or ''attacking the back''), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf |title=International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation \u2013 Rule Book |work =Official IFBJJ rules, see Article 5 \u2013 Fighting Conclusions, The order of the referee, subsection \u2013 E |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply [[chokeholds]], as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.\n\n=== North South position ===\nThe North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as ''deadweight''. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South [[Kimura lock|kimura]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bjj-world.com/bjj-north-south-position-attacks/|title=Versatile Attacks From The BJJ North-South Position|first=Ognen|last=Dzabirski|date=26 March 2018|website=Bjj-world.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{Main|Guard (grappling)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-jitsu-Closed guard.jpg|thumb|left|The Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in blue is demonstrating a type of closed [[Guard (grappling)|guard]]]]\n\nWhen in the \"Guard\" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.\n\nThe three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.\n\nIn closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.\n\nThere are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by [[Keenan Cornelius]]) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.\n\nIn the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions.  There is also a variant of half guard called \"50/50 guard\", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.\n\nAnother variation of the half guard position is the \"deep half guard\", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, [[Jeff Glover]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wbbjj.com/uncle-richard-guard/|title=Having Problems Understanding Deep Half Guard?

Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion.<ref name=\"mma\"/> Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by [[Submission (combat sport)|tapping]]. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.\n\n=== Compression locks ===\n\n''See also'' [[Compression lock]]\n\nA less common type of submission hold is a [[compression lock]], where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the [[Compression lock#Achilles lock|Achilles lock]], [[Compression lock#Biceps slicer|Bicep slicer]], and [[Compression lock#Leg slicer|Leg slicer]] (or Calf slicer).\n\n=== Joint locks ===\n[[File:In-guard armbar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A practitioner attempting an [[armbar]] submission]]\n\nWhile many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, [[Neck Crank|joint manipulations of the spine]] are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning [[cervical vertebrae]]. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the \"banana split\" from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow [[heel hooks]], which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous.<ref name=USGR/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Pearch |url=http://www.couch2cage.com/taboo-techniques-the-heel-hook-in-bjj-and-mma/ |title=Taboo techniques |website=Couch2cage.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.\n\nJoint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjjtech.com/tech/tech-list.asp?id=3&sub=y&name=Submissions|title=BJJ Technique Catalog: Category: Submissions|work=bjjtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Chokes ===\n[[File:MCMAP Rear choke - Defense Visual Information Center 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[rear naked choke]], as demonstrated by a [[MCMAP]] instructor]]\n[[Chokehold|Chokes]] are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the [[carotid]] arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve [[baroreceptor]]s in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3\u20135 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the [[windpipe]]) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.\n\nChokes include [[rear-naked choke]], [[Sankaku-jime|triangle]], [[Okuri eri jime|bow and arrow choke]], [[Sode guruma jime|sleeve choke]] (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), [[Kata juji jime#variants|baseball choke]], D'Arce, clock choke, [[Arm triangle choke]], north\u2013south choke, crucifix choke, anaconda choke, [[Gogoplata]], loop choke, and others.\n\n== Uniform ==\n{{Main|Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms ''[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi|gi]]'' or ''[[kimono]]'') is similar to a [[judogi]], but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|promoted]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of \"no-gi\" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., [[Rolles Gracie]] awarding [[Rashad Evans]] a black belt) has become more common.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Grading ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Black belt grades<br />(19 and over)\n|-\n|| Black 0\u20136 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ BlackBelt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Black/Red 7 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ black red belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red/White 8 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ red white belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red 9\u201310 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Red Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Senior belt colors<br />(16 and over)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"brackground:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Blue || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Blue Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Purple || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Purple Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Brown || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Brown Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Junior belt colours<br />(16 and under)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Grey || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Grey Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Yellow Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Orange || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Orange Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Green || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Green Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{{Main|Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|Gracie jiu-jitsu ranking system}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the [[Judo#Rank and grading|judo ranking system]] and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\">\n{{cite web |author=Camargo, Bruno |title= IBJJF Graduation system|url=http://www.ibjjf.org/graduation.htm |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gracie1\">{{cite book| last = Gracie| first = Renzo | authorlink =Renzo Gracie | last2 =Gracie | first2 =Royler | author2-link =Royler Gracie| title = Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique| publisher = Invisible Cities Press Llc| year = 2001\n| page = 304| isbn =1-931229-08-2 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\"/><ref name=\"Gracie1\"/> Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.\n\nUnlike in some martial arts such as [[taekwondo]] and [[karate]], a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/16-jiu-jitsu-practitioners-that-were-promoted-straight-to-black-belt/ | title =16 Jiu-Jitsu Practitioners That Were Promoted Straight to Black Belt | date = 2015-10-14 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/top-10-fastest-black-belt-promotions-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-history/ |last=Guillaume| first=Huni| title =Top 10 Fastest Black Belt Promotions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu History | date = 2015-09-10 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[F\u00e1bio Santos (fighter)|F\u00e1bio Santos]] | title =Passion makes him a champion | medium = | publisher = | location = | date =| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnnoBncArw&t=42s}}</ref> However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] and [[Carlos Gracie]]) has stated that the average of 10\u201312 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the [[ego (Freudian)|ego]] of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =Ryron Gracie | title =Ryron Gracie of the legendary Gracie Clan | medium = | publisher =plugonetwo.com | location =[[Beverly Hills, California]] | date =March 2014| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYQcRfhLCw&t=22m10s}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Federations ==\nSince its inception in Brazil, Jiu-Jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first Jiu-Jitsu Federation was the [[Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara]], which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making Jiu-Jitsu an [[Olympic sport]], and the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]], a profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments.<ref name=ibjjf>{{Cite web |url=https://ibjjf.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115181958/https://ibjjf.com/ |archive-date=2019-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Tournaments ==\nWhile there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles.  First, is the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments.  Second, is the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the [[Pan-American Championship (jiu-jitsu)|Pan American Championship]], [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]], and the [[Mundials]]. [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]] are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.  Other promotions within [[North America]], such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and [[North American Grappling Association]] (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.\n\nAnother tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] creator and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grandmaster [[Rorion Gracie]]. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems\n\nIn 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, \"Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of Jiu-Jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.\" Cheating in Jiu-Jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. \"[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,\" Rose said. \"That's not Jiu-Jitsu. That's cheating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/loretta_hunt/01/25/rose-gracie/ |title=Rose Gracie honors MMA roots with overhaul of Gracie U.S. Nationals \u2013 Loretta Hunt \u2013 SI.com |website=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThis discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread. [[Metamoris]], a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother [[Ralek Gracie]], has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI ([[Eddie Bravo Invitational]]), which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/polaris-3-the-aftermath/ |title=Polaris Pro - The Aftermath - Attack The Back |website=Attacktheback.com |date= 2016-04-03|accessdate=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt tournaments, especially those hosted by the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], some athletes engage in a practice called \"closing out.\"<ref name=\"graciemag.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.graciemag.com/en/2012/04/09/a-measure-for-quashing-closing-out-jiu-jitsu-finals/ |title = A measure for quashing closing out Jiu-Jitsu finals? &#124; Graciemag}}</ref> This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus \"Buchecha\" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/buchecha-surrenders-title-leandro-lo-plus-results-worlds-2018/ | title=Buchecha Surrenders Title to Leandro Lo - Plus More Results from WORLDS 2018| date=2018-06-04}}</ref> and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.<ref>https://www.flograppling.com/articles/5050610-how-the-miyao-brothers-embraced-the-bjj-lifestyle</ref> \nProponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed,<ref name=\"graciemag.com\"/> and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWuBHBAVJJ/</ref>\n\n== Health considerations ==\n=== Safety ===\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scoggin|first1=James F.|last2=Brusovanik|first2=Georgiy|last3=Izuka|first3=Byron H.|last4=Zandee van Rilland|first4=Eddy|last5=Geling|first5=Olga|last6=Tokumura|first6=Seren|title=Assessment of Injuries During Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competition|journal=Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=232596711452218|doi=10.1177/2325967114522184|pmid=26535299|pmc=4555620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreiswirth|first1=Ethan M.|last2=Myer|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Rauh|first3=Mitchell J.|title=Incidence of Injury Among Male Brazilian Jiujitsu Fighters at the World Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi Championship 2009|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=January 2014|volume=49|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.1.11|pmc=3917302|pmid=24377959}}</ref> This is lower than in [[mixed martial arts]] (236-286 per 1000), [[boxing]] (210-420 per 1000), [[judo]] (25.3-130.6) and [[taekwondo]] (20.5-139.5). It is similar to [[wrestling]], which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners suffer from are [[ACL tear]]s in the knees, [[rotator cuff]] tears in the shoulders and [[spinal disc hernia]]tions, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist [[tendonitis]], due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.\n\n=== Skin health ===\nBesides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions.  They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |title=BJJ Safety |website=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108182804/http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}</ref>  Several commonly contracted skin diseases include [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]], [[impetigo]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplersquest.com/blogs/briancimins/grappling-tournament-health-warning-advisory-dirty-mats-nearly-caused-amputation-2 |title=Grappling Tournament Health Warning Advisory \u2013 Dirty Mats nearly caused AMPUTATION in 2009!!! |publisher=Grapplers Quest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with [[soap]], disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]/[[rashguard]]/[[Wrestling headgear|headgear]] used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a [[barrier cream]] greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.\n\n=== Cauliflower ear ===\n[[File:Dom Cruz 2.png|thumb|Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears]]\n\nDue to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in Jiu-Jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell.  Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the [[perichondrium]] that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed ([[cauliflower ear]]). [[Wrestling headgear]] is sometimes used for prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplearts.com/Cauliflower-Ears-In-Brazilian-jiu-jitsu.html |title=Cauliflower ears in Grappling |website=Grapplearts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\nThe practice of taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including [[Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|anabolic steroids]], is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of Jiu-Jitsu's top competitors, including [[Rodrigo Medeiros|Comprido]] and [[Caio Terra]].<ref>{{cite web |author=: Equipe Brasa : : Brasa team : Brazilian Jiu Jitu |url=http://brasa.brazilianblackbelt.com/2011/05/comprido-felipe-costa-and-caio-terra-united-against-steroids-in-bjj/ |title=Black belts united against steroids in BJJ.

{"title_page": "Culture of Los Angeles", "text_new": "The culture of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] is rich with arts and ethnically diverse. The greater Los Angeles metro area has several notable art museums including the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA), the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] on the [[Santa Monica mountains]] overlooking the Pacific, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MOCA), the [[Hammer Museum]] and the [[Norton Simon Museum]]. In the 1920s and 1930s [[Will Durant]] and [[Ariel Durant]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and other intellectuals were the representatives of culture, in addition to the movie writers and directors. As the city flourished financially in the middle of the 20th century, culture followed. [[Boosterism|Boosters]] such as [[Dorothy Buffum Chandler]] and other philanthropists raised funds for the establishment of art museums, music centers and theaters. Today, the Southland cultural scene is as complex, sophisticated and varied as any in the world.\n\n== The Arts ==\n\n=== Architecture ===\nLos Angeles has many different types of architectural styles scattered throughout the city and nearby satellite cities. Los Angeles has a rich, diverse history of architectural works, having been known throughout professional architectural circles as a testbed for architecture. The [[case study houses]] in particular revolutionized residential architecture. Architects such as [[Richard Neutra]], [[Jack A. Charney|Jack Charney]], [[Pierre Koenig]], [[John Lautner]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] all have important works in the city. Some of the different types of architectural styles throughout the city and metropolitan area are [[Mission Revival architecture|mission revival]], [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish colonial revival]], [[American Craftsman|craftsman]], [[Norman architecture|Norman French provincial]], French chateau, [[Tudor Revival architecture|English Tudor]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux arts]], [[Art Deco in the United States|art deco]], and [[Streamline Moderne|streamline moderne]].[[Image:Easternstandard cropped by mlsb.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eastern Columbia Building]] is a well known Art Deco building in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]]]In downtown Los Angeles, there are several buildings constructed in the [[Art Deco]] style. In recognition of this heritage, the recently built Metropolitan Transit Authority building incorporates subtle Art Deco characteristics.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nModern architecture in the city ranges from the works of pioneering African-American architect [[Paul Williams (Architect)|Paul Williams]], to the iconoclastic [[deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] forms of [[Frank Gehry]], a long-time resident of the city. [[Charles Eames]] and his wife [[Ray Eames]] designed famous chairs and other domestic goods.[[Image:Highsmithlacmaoblique.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]\n\n=== Visual arts in Los Angeles ===\nThe ''[[plein air]]'' movement of [[impressionism|impressionistic]] landscape painting found early adherents in the Los Angeles area. Instrumental in the development of the genre was the [[California Art Club]] (est. 1909) that provided numerous exhibitions and lectures. The art form continues to be recognized as a signature style of California art. In the 1960s, [[Corita Kent]], then known as Sister Mary Corita of [[Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart College]], created bright, bold [[serigraph]]s carrying the messages of love and peace.\n\nLos Angeles is known for its '''[[mural]] art''', and its thousands of examples of wall art are believed to outnumber those in every other city in the world. Mexican muralists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]] all created public art murals in the area.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the '''[[Chicano Movement#Chicano art|Chicano art movement]]''' took a strong hold in Los Angeles. Much of the work produced followed the Mexican muralist tradition of sending potent social messages. Works produced in this era by [[East Los Streetscapers]], [[Judy Baca]] and others are found citywide. Chicano arts in Los Angeles also gave rise to the internationally renowned [[Self Help Graphics & Art]], known for its [[Corita Kent]]-influenced serigraphs and its annual [[D\u00eda de los Muertos]] festival.\n\n[[Image:Mural LA Central Library.jpg|left|thumb|225px|An example of a Chicano-themed mural in the [[Richard Riordan Central Library]]]]\n\nMuch of the energy in the city's '''art scene''' in the 1945 to 1980 stretch came from private collectors, artists' collectives, print shops, art schools and especially from commercial galleries.<ref name=\"latimes.com\">Scott Timberg (January 1, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-pst-gallery-owners-20120101,0,5052133,full.story Galleries fostered L.A.'s postwar art scene] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>\n\n=== Public Art in Los Angeles ===\n[[Public art|Public Art]] in the downtown area of Los Angeles during the 1970s was characterized by large abstract sculptures such as [http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/double-ascension-1973-by-herbert-bayer \"Double Ascension\"] (1973) and [http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/four-arches-1973-by-alexander-calder \"Four Arches\"] (1973), both on Bunker Hill.  In 1989 the City passed an ordinance requiring developers to contribute one percent of the cost of construction of new buildings to a [[public art]] fund.  The resulting funds for public art and public art programs in the 1990s, coupled with substantial subway and light rail transit, created public art installations in new rail stations and public spaces throughout the city and beyond.  \n\nAccording to K. M. Williamson, Director of [[Public Art in Public Places]], Los Angeles now hosts one of the world's most popular and widely photographed public artworks of the early 21st century: Chris Burden's [[Urban Light]] (2008) in front of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard.  It attracts hundreds of visitors daily, has been featured in several films as an iconic image of Los Angeles, and has become a tourist destination and popular public space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apalosangeles.org/public-art-in-public-places-l-a-s-iconic-urban-light/|title=LA's Iconic \"Urban Light\"|last=Williamson|first=K.

Renamed the [[Pasadena Art Museum]], it organized some of the most adventurous and cutting edge shows of contemporary art in the region, notably, an early Pop art show in 1962, and a [[Marcel Duchamp]] retrospective in 1963. Although the city had a long tradition of visual arts supported by private collectors and galleries, Los Angeles did not have a comprehensive museum of art until 1965, when [[LACMA]] opened its doors. At about the same time, [[La Cienega Boulevard]] became home to many art galleries, most notably [[Ferus]], featuring works by artists who lived in the area, [[Virginia Dwan|Dwan Gallery]], and Riko Mizuno Gallery.<ref name=\"latimes.com\" /> Although [[Andy Warhol]] was New York based, the famous \"soup cans\" were first exhibited at Ferus. A local exponent of pop art was [[Ed Ruscha]], some of whose work was representational, others consisted of simple slogans or mottoes which were usually humorous, being so far out of the context where such statements would normally appear. An example of this is ''Nice Hot Vegetables'' [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], for example, explored the interaction of a sculpture to its environment, demonstrating that the boundaries are usually not entirely clear. [[David Hockney]], an English immigrant, produced figurative paintings set in idyllic Southern California locales, such as swimming pools in the bright sunlight, belonging to modernist houses. Although these paintings are representational, they seem to be composed of small color patches, somewhat like collages. [[Finish Fetish]]\u2014a style that emphasized gleaming surfaces\u2014and [[Light and Space]]\u2014art about perception\u2014were other Ferus-bred styles that allowed L.A. to distinguish itself from the rest of the art world. It was during this period that the contemporary arts scene in Los Angeles began to command the attention of collectors and museum directors internationally.\n\nSome of the most respected '''art museums''' in the world can be found in Los Angeles. They include the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[the Broad]], the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[Huntington Library]] art collection and botanical gardens, and the [[Hammer Museum]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Los Angeles is known for its expansive collections of contemporary art- the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] has three separate incarnations: the Geffen Contemporary, for larger installation pieces by more renowned artists, the MOCA Downtown, its standard collection, and the Pacific Palisades, a large, multi-purpose building in [[modernist]] style that houses offices as well as stores and showrooms for contemporary graphic design, architecture, and interior design. Other smaller art museums in the city include the [[Craft and Folk Art Museum]], the [[California African American Museum]], and many sculpture gardens throughout the city, including those at the [[American Jewish University]] and the [[Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden]]. Private art collections that are open to the public are the ones by [[Eli Broad]] and the [[Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation]].  The growth of Los Angeles as an art capital was first comprehensively documented in a series of exhibitions partially funded and spearheaded by the Getty, but held at all major museums during the Fall of 2011. \"The exhibitions, and the events that accompanied them as part of \"Pacific Standard Time\" demonstrated the pivotal role played by Southern California in national and international artistic movements since the middle of the twentieth century. Art institutions from Santa Barbara to San Diego are joining together to create programs that highlighted the region's vibrant artistic scene.\"[http://www.getty.edu/news/press/pacific_standard_time_release.html]  [[Culver City]]'s La Cienega Boulevard features one of the highest concentrations of '''fine art galleries''' and studios in Southern California. The trendy [[bohemianism|bohemian]] neighborhoods of [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] and [[Los Feliz]] are home to numerous smaller galleries, showcasing local or underground art. [[Gallery Row, Los Angeles, California|Gallery Row]] downtown is known for its small [[DIY]] galleries, such as [[The Smell]], which doubles as a [[punk rock|punk]] and [[noise music]] venue.\n\n==== Art Schools and Colleges ====\nLos Angeles County is home to three professional '''art colleges''', [[Art Center College of Design]], founded on 1930 in [[downtown Los Angeles]] as the Art Center School, [[Otis College of Art and Design]], which was founded in 1917 as Otis Art Institute, and [[California Institute of the Arts]], founded in 1961 as successor of the [[Chouinard Art Institute]].\n\n== Cuisine ==\n{{See also|Korean taco}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n[[Image:052607-005-Tommys.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The [[Original Tommy's]] Hamburgers]]\nWhile the cuisines of many cultures have taken root in Los Angeles, it is the home of the [[cobb salad|Cobb Salad]], invented in the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant in [[Hollywood]], the [[French-Dip sandwich]], originated early in the 20th Century by either [[Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet]] or [[Phillippe's]]\u2014both of which still exist downtown, the ice blended coffee drink by [[Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf]] and [[Original Tommy's]] [[Hamburger]].\nThe strength of the city's scene is in \"ethnic\" dining and it is considered to be one of the most dynamic scenes in the world in terms of range and depth. Los Angeles has an enormous variety of restaurants. In its predominantly African American neighborhoods are [[soul food]] restaurants such as [[Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles]]. According to ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America'', Los Angeles \"remains the United States's preeminent city to eat regional Mexican food.\"<ref name=\"SmithKraig2013\">{{cite book|author1=Andrew Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA487|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|author2=Bruce Kraig|date=31 January 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973496-2|page=487}}</ref>\n\nGiven its close proximity to Asia and constant flow of Asian immigrants, [[Asian food]] has the largest foothold in Los Angeles after [[Mexican cuisine]]. Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai restaurants are extremely common place. Japanese food in particular is a staple of Los Angeles' haute cuisine scene with places like Urasawa in [[Beverly Hills]], Nobu in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and Koi in [[Hollywood]].

[[Nathanael West]]'s book, ''[[The Day of the Locust]]'', depicted a raw side to the Hollywood dream. [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote science fiction after moving to the city in 1934. Actress [[Carrie Fisher]] found success as a novelist.

The landmark [[Capitol Records]] building, which resembles a stack of albums, is representative of this. [[A&M Records]] long occupied a studio off [[Sunset Boulevard]] built by [[Charlie Chaplin]] (who wrote the music for his own films). The [[Warner Brothers]] built a major recording business in addition to their film business. At the other end of the business, local [[Rhino Records]] began a reissue boom by digging through archives of old recordings and repackaging them for modern audiences.\n\nLos Angeles had a vibrant African-American musical community even when it was relatively small: a number of musical artists congregated around [[Central Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Central Avenue]], and the community produced a number of great talents, including [[Charles Mingus]], [[Buddy Collette]], [[Gerald Wilson]], and others in the 1930s and 1940s before disappearing in the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[Sunset Strip]] became a breeding ground for bands like [[The Byrds]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[The Doors]]. [[Randy Newman]] also started his career during this time, and the [[Beach Boys]] were founded in nearby [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] during this same decade as well. Much hard rock has come out of Los Angeles, including hard rockers [[Van Halen]] from nearby [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], \"hair bands\" like [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Ratt]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], and [[Guns N' Roses]], [[thrash metal]] acts like [[Megadeth]], [[Metallica]] (who later relocated to [[San Francisco]]) and [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]]), and also 1990s rock bands such as [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Korn]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Softer rock acts also flourished, as evidenced by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] during the 1970s. There was a sizeable [[punk rock]] movement which spawned the hardcore punk movement featuring bands like [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]]. In the 1980s, the [[Paisley Underground]] movement was native to Los Angeles. In the 1990s, Los Angeles' contribution to rock music continued with acclaimed artists such as [[Beck]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[System of a Down]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Other notable rock acts formed in Los Angeles during this decade include [[Linkin Park]], [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], and [[No Doubt]]. In addition, the [[gangsta rap]] of [[N.W.A]], and later the solo careers of [[Dr. Dre]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]], [[2Pac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], among related acts, reestablished Los Angeles (particularly the communities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Compton, California|Compton]]) as a center of [[African-American]] musical development and [[G-funk]] as one of hip-hop's major living styles. The 2000s saw a further flourishing of the Los Angeles rock scene with acclaimed acts such as [[Maroon 5]] and a resurgence in [[West Coast hip hop]] in the form of rappers such as [[Game (rapper)|The Game]]. [[The Black Eyed Peas]] gained even greater popularity during this decade, and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] stars such as [[Hilary Duff]], [[Ashley Tisdale]], and [[Miley Cyrus]] also anchored their singing careers in the Los Angeles area as well.\n\nIn the heart of downtown Los Angeles is the Music Center of Los Angeles County. The Music Center consists of the new [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], the [[Ahmanson Theatre]], and the Mark Taper Forum. The courtyard, fountain, and public art make it a beautiful location. Adding to its cultural importance, on the same street are the Los Angeles Central Library, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], the Colburn School of Performing Arts, and the Cathedral of our Lady of the Angels. The [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] now performs at [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] after having spent many years in residence at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], and performs summer concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. The Los Angeles Master Chorale also calls the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] home. The [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] is also the residence of the [[Los Angeles Opera]] and Dance at the Music Center. The Ahmanson Theatre, Mark Taper Forum, and the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, are home to the Center Theatre Group, directed by Michael Ritchie.[[Contemporary Opera Los Angeles]] presents performances that are sung in English and set in a contemporary style and their proceeds benefit local children's education charities and animal rescue charities.\n\nThe demands of scoring thousands of hours of soundtracks for TV and movies also provides work for composers and classically trained musicians, bands, orchestras, and symphonies.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society|Los Angeles}}\n*[[LGBT culture in Los Angeles]]\n*[[Los Angeles in popular culture]]\n*[https://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/PUBLIC-ART-BY-CITY/Los-Angeles List of Public Art in Los Angeles]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mike Davis, ''City of Quartz'', London, Verso, 1990\n* Nancy Marmer, \"Pop Art in California\", ''Pop Art'', ed.

In the 1920s and 1930s [[Will Durant]] and [[Ariel Durant]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and other intellectuals were the representatives of culture, in addition to the movie writers and directors.

Los Angeles has an enormous variety of restaurants. In its predominantly African American neighborhoods are [[soul food]] restaurants such as [[Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles]].

Renamed the [[Pasadena Art Museum]], it organized some of the most adventurous and cutting edge shows of contemporary art in the region, notably, an early Pop art show in 1962, and a [[Marcel Duchamp]] retrospective in 1963. Although the city had a long tradition of visual arts supported by private collectors and galleries, Los Angeles did not have a comprehensive museum of art until 1965, when [[LACMA]] opened its doors. At about the same time, [[La Cienega Boulevard]] became home to many art galleries, most notably [[Ferus]], featuring works by artists who lived in the area, [[Virginia Dwan|Dwan Gallery]], and Riko Mizuno Gallery.<ref name=\"latimes.com\" /> Although [[Andy Warhol]] was New York based, the famous \"soup cans\" were first exhibited at Ferus. A local exponent of pop art was [[Ed Ruscha]], some of whose work was representational, others consisted of simple slogans or mottoes which were usually humorous, being so far out of the context where such statements would normally appear. An example of this is ''Nice Hot Vegetables'' [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], for example, explored the interaction of a sculpture to its environment, demonstrating that the boundaries are usually not entirely clear. [[David Hockney]], an English immigrant, produced figurative paintings set in idyllic Southern California locales, such as swimming pools in the bright sunlight, belonging to modernist houses. Although these paintings are representational, they seem to be composed of small color patches, somewhat like collages. [[Finish Fetish]]\u2014a style that emphasized gleaming surfaces\u2014and [[Light and Space]]\u2014art about perception\u2014were other Ferus-bred styles that allowed L.A. to distinguish itself from the rest of the art world. It was during this period that the contemporary arts scene in Los Angeles began to command the attention of collectors and museum directors internationally.\n\nSome of the most respected '''art museums''' in the world can be found in Los Angeles. They include the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[the Broad]], the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[Huntington Library]] art collection and botanical gardens, and the [[Hammer Museum]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Los Angeles is known for its expansive collections of contemporary art- the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] has three separate incarnations: the Geffen Contemporary, for larger installation pieces by more renowned artists, the MOCA Downtown, its standard collection, and the Pacific Palisades, a large, multi-purpose building in [[modernist]] style that houses offices as well as stores and showrooms for contemporary graphic design, architecture, and interior design. Other smaller art museums in the city include the [[Craft and Folk Art Museum]], the [[California African American Museum]], and many sculpture gardens throughout the city, including those at the [[American Jewish University]] and the [[Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden]]. Private art collections that are open to the public are the ones by [[Eli Broad]] and the [[Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation]].  The growth of Los Angeles as an art capital was first comprehensively documented in a series of exhibitions partially funded and spearheaded by the Getty, but held at all major museums during the Fall of 2011. \"The exhibitions, and the events that accompanied them as part of \"Pacific Standard Time\" demonstrated the pivotal role played by Southern California in national and international artistic movements since the middle of the twentieth century. Art institutions from Santa Barbara to San Diego are joining together to create programs that highlighted the region's vibrant artistic scene.\"[http://www.getty.edu/news/press/pacific_standard_time_release.html]  [[Culver City]]'s La Cienega Boulevard features one of the highest concentrations of '''fine art galleries''' and studios in Southern California. The trendy [[bohemianism|bohemian]] neighborhoods of [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] and [[Los Feliz]] are home to numerous smaller galleries, showcasing local or underground art.

The landmark [[Capitol Records]] building, which resembles a stack of albums, is representative of this. [[A&M Records]] long occupied a studio off [[Sunset Boulevard]] built by [[Charlie Chaplin]] (who wrote the music for his own films). The [[Warner Brothers]] built a major recording business in addition to their film business. At the other end of the business, local [[Rhino Records]] began a reissue boom by digging through archives of old recordings and repackaging them for modern audiences.\n\nLos Angeles had a vibrant African-American musical community even when it was relatively small: a number of musical artists congregated around [[Central Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Central Avenue]], and the community produced a number of great talents, including [[Charles Mingus]], [[Buddy Collette]], [[Gerald Wilson]], and others in the 1930s and 1940s before disappearing in the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[Sunset Strip]] became a breeding ground for bands like [[The Byrds]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[The Doors]]. [[Randy Newman]] also started his career during this time, and the [[Beach Boys]] were founded in nearby [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] during this same decade as well. Much hard rock has come out of Los Angeles, including hard rockers [[Van Halen]] from nearby [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], \"hair bands\" like [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Ratt]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], and [[Guns N' Roses]], [[thrash metal]] acts like [[Megadeth]], [[Metallica]] (who later relocated to [[San Francisco]]) and [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]]), and also 1990s rock bands such as [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Korn]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Softer rock acts also flourished, as evidenced by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] during the 1970s. There was a sizeable [[punk rock]] movement which spawned the hardcore punk movement featuring bands like [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]]. In the 1980s, the [[Paisley Underground]] movement was native to Los Angeles. In the 1990s, Los Angeles' contribution to rock music continued with acclaimed artists such as [[Beck]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[System of a Down]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Other notable rock acts formed in Los Angeles during this decade include [[Linkin Park]], [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], and [[No Doubt]]. In addition, the [[gangsta rap]] of [[N.W.A]], and later the solo careers of [[Dr. Dre]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]], [[2Pac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], among related acts, reestablished Los Angeles (particularly the communities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Compton, California|Compton]]) as a center of [[African-American]] musical development and [[G-funk]] as one of hip-hop's major living styles. The 2000s saw a further flourishing of the Los Angeles rock scene with acclaimed acts such as [[Maroon 5]] and a resurgence in [[West Coast hip hop]] in the form of rappers such as [[Game (rapper)|The Game]]. [[The Black Eyed Peas]] gained even greater popularity during this decade, and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] stars such as [[Hilary Duff]], [[Ashley Tisdale]], and [[Miley Cyrus]] also anchored their singing careers in the Los Angeles area as well.\n\nIn the heart of downtown Los Angeles is the Music Center of Los Angeles County. The Music Center consists of the new [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], the [[Ahmanson Theatre]], and the Mark Taper Forum. The courtyard, fountain, and public art make it a beautiful location. Adding to its cultural importance, on the same street are the Los Angeles Central Library, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], the Colburn School of Performing Arts, and the Cathedral of our Lady of the Angels. The [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] now performs at [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] after having spent many years in residence at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], and performs summer concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. The Los Angeles Master Chorale also calls the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] home. The [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] is also the residence of the [[Los Angeles Opera]] and Dance at the Music Center. The Ahmanson Theatre, Mark Taper Forum, and the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, are home to the Center Theatre Group, directed by Michael Ritchie.[[Contemporary Opera Los Angeles]] presents performances that are sung in English and set in a contemporary style and their proceeds benefit local children's education charities and animal rescue charities.\n\nThe demands of scoring thousands of hours of soundtracks for TV and movies also provides work for composers and classically trained musicians, bands, orchestras, and symphonies.\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nThe ''[[plein air]]'' movement of [[impressionism|impressionistic]] landscape painting found early adherents in the Los Angeles area. Instrumental in the development of the genre was the [[California Art Club]] (est. 1909) that provided numerous exhibitions and lectures. The art form continues to be recognized as a signature style of California art. In the 1960s, [[Corita Kent]], then known as Sister Mary Corita of [[Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart College]], created bright, bold [[serigraph]]s carrying the messages of love and peace.\n\nLos Angeles is known for its '''[[mural]] art''', and its thousands of examples of wall art are believed to outnumber those in every other city in the world. Mexican muralists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]] all created public art murals in the area.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the '''[[Chicano Movement#Chicano art|Chicano art movement]]''' took a strong hold in Los Angeles. Much of the work produced followed the Mexican muralist tradition of sending potent social messages. Works produced in this era by [[East Los Streetscapers]], [[Judy Baca]] and others are found citywide. Chicano arts in Los Angeles also gave rise to the internationally renowned [[Self Help Graphics & Art]], known for its [[Corita Kent]]-influenced serigraphs and its annual [[D\u00eda de los Muertos]] festival.\n\n[[Image:Mural LA Central Library.jpg|left|thumb|225px|An example of a Chicano-themed mural in the [[Richard Riordan Central Library]]]]\n\nMuch of the energy in the city's '''art scene''' in the 1945 to 1980 stretch came from private collectors, artists' collectives, print shops, art schools and especially from commercial galleries.<ref name=\"latimes.com\">Scott Timberg (January 1, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-pst-gallery-owners-20120101,0,5052133,full.story Galleries fostered L.A.'s postwar art scene] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>\n\nPublic Art in the downtown area of Los Angeles during the 1970s was characterized by large abstract sculptures such as [http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/double-ascension-1973-by-herbert-bayer \"Double Ascension\"] (1973) and [http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/four-arches-1973-by-alexander-calder \"Four Arches\"] (1973), both on Bunker Hill.  In 1989 the City passed an ordinance requiring developers to contribute one percent of the cost of construction of new buildings to a [[public art]] fund.  The resulting funds for public art and public art programs in the 1990s, coupled with substantial subway and light rail transit, created opportunities in multiple public agencies for public art acquisitions and installations in new rail stations, public spaces, and throughout the city.  Public art in Los Angeles and the surrounding area is documented online by [[Public Art in Public Places]].\n\n==== Art Schools and Colleges ====\nLos Angeles County is home to three professional '''art colleges''', [[Art Center College of Design]], founded on 1930 in [[downtown Los Angeles]] as the Art Center School, [[Otis College of Art and Design]], which was founded in 1917 as Otis Art Institute, and [[California Institute of the Arts]], founded in 1961 as successor of the [[Chouinard Art Institute]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society|Los Angeles}}\n*[[LGBT culture in Los Angeles]]\n*[[Los Angeles in popular culture]]\n*[[List of public art in Los Angeles]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mike Davis, ''City of Quartz'', London, Verso, 1990\n* Nancy Marmer, \"Pop Art in California\", ''Pop Art'', ed.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil.

Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both.  They remained at Anzio under continuous fire for an extended period. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one last task in the Mediterranean, [[Operation Dragoon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]].  These installations provided airfields and ports that supported [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the Northern sealanes. To complete a line of bases with this purpose, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to South for [[Operation Overlord]]. The Seabees built invasion bases from [[Milford Haven]] to [[Exter]]and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU). Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy fire. Ignoring this NCDUs worked until all charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion force arrived Seabees began placeing pontoon causeways over which the assault went ashore.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Another Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material went ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to be a temporary port until French ports could be used.  Even after weather disabled the harbor Seabees continued to get thousands of tons supplies and troops ashore daily.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed to replace Mulberry A. Foreseeing the Allieds would want to use those harbors the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships simultaneously. They repeated this at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even put Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] across.\" <ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to set foot in Germany.  They also were the first CB to deployed by air.  They were flown to [[Bremen]] in April 1945 setting up camp on the city's out-skirts. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the U.S. Navy Hq in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion was back in England concluding Atlantic operations.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.

In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days.

The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].  The 83rd CB cut highway out of [[Port of Spain]], that required moving a million cubic yards of material.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" /> \"On the [[Galapagos Islands]], CBD 1012 constructed a seaplane base with tank farm and did the same again at [[Salinas, Ecuador]]. Salinas would be the southernmost U.S. base in the Pacific.  In general, Seabees in this zone manned bases completed pre-war.  While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both.  They remained at Anzio under continuous fire for an extended period. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one last task in the Mediterranean, [[Operation Dragoon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]].  These installations provided airfields and ports that supported [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the Northern sealanes. To complete a line of bases with this purpose, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to South for [[Operation Overlord]]. The Seabees built invasion bases from [[Milford Haven]] to [[Exter]]and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU). Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy fire. Ignoring this NCDUs worked until all charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion force arrived Seabees began placeing pontoon causeways over which the assault went ashore.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Another Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material went ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to be a temporary port until French ports could be used.  Even after weather disabled the harbor Seabees continued to get thousands of tons supplies and troops ashore daily.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed to replace Mulberry A. Foreseeing the Allieds would want to use those harbors the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships simultaneously. They repeated this at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even put Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] across.\" <ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to set foot in Germany.  They also were the first CB to deployed by air.  They were flown to [[Bremen]] in April 1945 setting up camp on the city's out-skirts. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the U.S. Navy Hq in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion was back in England concluding Atlantic operations.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

As the battle progressed, portable flame units were sustaining casualty rates as high as 92%, leaving few troops trained to use the weapon.  More and more calls came for the Mark-1s to the point that the Marines became dependent upon the tanks and would hold up their assault until a flame tank was available.<ref name= \"USAFlame\"/> Since each tank battalion had only four they were not assigned.  Rather, they were \"pooled\" and would dispatch from their respective refueling locations.  One of the tanks the 4th got had a 50 cal. machine gun coaxial to the flamethrower as well as {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} concrete armored sides.  Towards the end the 5th Marine tanks sprayed between {{convert|5,000| to| 10,000|usgal|L|abbr=on}} gallons  per day.<ref name=\"USAFlame\" />\n\nFor Okinawa the U.S. Army decided that the entire [[713th Tank Battalion]] would provisionally convert to flame. It was decided that the battalion would be tasked to support both the Army and the Marines. It was ordered to Schofield Barracks on Nov 10. There the Seabees supervised three officers and 60 enlisted of the 713th convert all 54 of their tanks to Ronsons.{{sfn|Zaloga|2013|p=29}}<ref>{{cite |title= Flamethrower Tanks on Okinawa |author=1st Lt.

A posse of bounty hunters, led by Josiah, is formed and are in hot pursuit, \u201conly being a half-day behind them\".\n\nThe outlaws are now down to four after one of the men was shot dead after the robbery.  They are met on the path by a couple, who are the aunt and uncle of Charlie, and brought them supplies.  They find out that there is a bounty of 8000 dollars on their heads. They shoot the couple so they cannot turn them in for the reward money.\n\nThe posse comes upon the scene of the dead couple, and Josiah talks to the couples' granddaughter Lulu, who hid in the bushes when her grandparents were shot.  She tells them that they are headed East through White Sands, to make them more difficult to track.\n\nThe outlaws are down to three, when one passes out and they shoot him to put him out of his misery. They spot the Tildon farm, where Preacher George and Ada live with their teenage daughters, Charlotte and Florence, and make plan to descend on them at dark.\n\nThey burst in to the house, and start eating and drinking whiskey and intend to have relations with the women. Florence catches Henry's eye and he calls her to sit on his lap.  Ada and George plead with the men because she is only 15, but both are brutally subdued by Charlie and Little Joe. George says he is the preacher of the chapel on the property, but nobody attends now because the town was ravaged by consumption.\n\nHenry orders Little Joe to keep watch outside and take Charlotte with him. Henry wants a massage from Florence and they go into the bedroom. He is put off when she tries to perform oral sex on him, saying she is an \"adventuress\".  He says he wants to have relations with her, but wants it done the proper way. Little Joe's advances are rebuffed when he tries to talk with Charlotte, who is disgusted with him. Charlie sexually assaults Ada while her husband sleeps next to her on the floor.\n\nFlorence becomes enamored by Henry and plans to elope with him, to the dismay of her family. Florence pulls a gun on George, but Henry stops her from shooting him. She shoots and kills Charlotte.\n\nHenry asks George why Charlotte could not bear children. He lies and says it was because of the fever, but then confesses that he got Charlotte pregnant when she was 11 when he was \"sick with devil's seed\" and that a botched abortion was the cause of Charlotte not being able to have kids. George says he stopped a long time ago, but Henry knows he's lying and that he has continued to have relations with his daughters on a weekly basis.\n\nHenry orders Little Joe to anally rape George, but calls him off, saying that he just wanted to scare him. Florence comes back in and uses a shot gun to beat George to death so he can feel the pain instead of a quick death. When asked why she killed Charlotte, she says it was because she enjoyed what went on with George. Florence spares Ada and leaves a bag of gold coins and the group leaves. Josiah gets to the farm and finds Ada sitting on the stairs of the chapel, apparently in a catatonic state. He steals the bag of coins, but Ada shoots him to death as he walks away.  \n\nThe group makes it to Mexico and Florence shoots all three men. Charlie dies instantly, but Little Joe is still standing when Henry shoots him to keep him from shooting at Florence.  Florence apologizes to Henry, saying she really wanted to go with him, but the reward money was too good to pass up.  Henry shoots himself in the head and dies.  Florence chops their heads off with an ax and bags them to turn in for the bounty.  Back at the farm, Florence shoots Ada.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Henry\n* [[Francesca Eastwood]] as Florence Tildon\n* [[Teri Polo]] as Ada Tildon\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Esther\n* [[Luce Rains]] as Augustus\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Josiah\n* [[Steven Michael Quezada]] as Alonzo\n* [[Ben Browder]] as George Tildon\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as Charlotte Tildon\n* [[Keith Loneker]] as Little Joe\n* [[Nathan Russell]] as Charlie\n* [[Connor Paolo]] as Connor\n* Lela Rose Allen as Lulu\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival.

Florence comes back in and uses a shot gun to beat George to death so he can feel the pain instead of a quick death.  When asked why she killed Charlotte, she says it was because she enjoyed what went on with George.  Florence spares Ada and leaves a bag of gold coins and the group leaves.  Josiah gets to the farm and finds Ada sitting on the stairs of the chapel, apparently in a catatonic state. He steals the bag of coins, but Ada shoots him to death as he walks away.  \n\nThe group makes it to Mexico and Florence shoots all three men. Charlie dies instantly, but Little Joe is still standing when Henry shoots him to keep him from shooting at Florence.  Florence apologizes to Henry, saying she really wanted to go with him, but the reward money was too good to pass up.  Henry shoots himself in the head and dies.  Florence chops their heads off with an ax and bags them to turn in for the bounty.  Back at the farm, Florence shoots Ada.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Henry\n* [[Francesca Eastwood]] as Florence Tildon\n* [[Teri Polo]] as Ada Tildon\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Esther\n* [[Luce Rains]] as Augustus\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Josiah\n* [[Steven Michael Quezada]] as Alonzo\n* [[Ben Browder]] as George Tildon\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as Charlotte Tildon\n* [[Keith Loneker]] as Little Joe\n* [[Nathan Russell]] as Charlie\n* [[Connor Paolo]] as Connor\n* Lela Rose Allen as Lulu\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival.
