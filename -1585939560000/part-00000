He was the first non-[[Indian National Congress|Congress]] Chief Minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]], representing the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) founded by him in 1982. His first term lasted 1<small>&1/2</small> years from January 1983 to August 1984. He was ousted in a coup in August 1984, but returned to power a month later, which marked the beginning of his second term. He remained Chief Minister for the next five years, completing his full 5-year term as Chief Minister. In 1989, his party lost in the assembly elections, and it was not until 1994 that he would become Chief Minister again. His third and last term as Chief Minister only lasted nine months, from December 1994 to September 1995, following which his son-in-law Nara Chandrababu Naidu took over the party and became Chief Minister.\n\nThe political priorities of NTR during all his three terms as Chief Minister were widely debated, with the [[right-wing politics|right-wing parties]] accusing him of economic populism, the [[left-wing politics|left-wing parties]] accusing him of diverting resources away from government employee benefits and his supporters arguing that they were worthwhile investments into infrastructure, human resource development and social net programs.\n\n==Achievements==\n# After getting elected in 1983 his first legislation was the passing of  Andhra Pradesh upa lok pal (civil society OMBUDSMAN) bill inspired by Scandinavian laws.

He created a broad direction and implemented it under the able leadership of an educator [[Gali Muddu Krishnama Naidu]]. His direction was driven by considerations of a) future b)fairness c) economic competitiveness. On future he saw education is the vehicle for social transformation especially for the socially dis-advantaged and women. On fairness, expanding access to the best educational opportunities to the most deserving was seen as a vehicle for improving efficiency of the entire society. On Competitiveness, he observed that Telugu economy will one day be big and be mostly about serving Telugu population needs and in this economy a local advantage to local people will only happen if education was primarily in Telugu. He also observed that wealth would need trade and uniquely Telugu products sold outside will be the most valuable trade hence, preserving unique Telugu cultural advantages need to be enhanced with education. He also observed that trading with the world will be important and learning other languages would have to be an essential part of primary education especially English and Hindi. He pushed back on the argument that the rich in Telugu lands are doing it right by sending their kids to private English medium schools by saying, this behavior is a symptom of our desperation and past failures not a path for future success. He proposed a three-point formula for addressing this issue: i) Make all local government jobs/educational institution entrances and business to be in Telugu and Urudu so local kids have an inherent advantage and local private schools will have to teach Telugu ii) invest and revamp Telugu academy to continuously translate all the latest knowledge from around the world into Telugu iii) improve government schools and introduce English and Hindi as additional compulsory subjects like the other non-English speaking European countries. He subscribed to the modern European educational concept that learning in mother tongue is always easier than in a language used solely at school. The only future in which being solely educated in a foreign language will be helpful is an future where Telugu people cannot create an economy that provides for Telugu needs.     \n#Overhauled the entire state's education syllabus for schools. He instituted statewide entrance examinations for all disciplines of higher education vis-\u00e0-vis Engineering and Medicine to name a few called [[EAMCET]] (Engineering and Medical Common Entrance Test). Students, based on the merit of their ranks obtained in these tests, could join any state college of their choice. He banned capitation fee based admissions in higher education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rama Rao-Profile|url=http://www.supertelugu.com/profiles/profiles.php?id=35|publisher=Supertelugu.com|access-date=2 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912225655/http://www.supertelugu.com/profiles/profiles.php?id=35|archive-date=12 September 2011|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n#NTR banned government school teachers from running private tuition institutions on the side.

While Mr.[[Kanuri Lakshmana Rao]] was a very ill octogenarian at the time, still created the blue print for the irrigation revolution that followed in the Telugu land. The key points of the comprehensive thought around irrigation were a) Southern rain fed rivers need to be linked with northern glacier fed rivers. This point was the core of NTR's contribution to irrigation, he unified the southern states around this idea and got Mr. [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] to declare [[Indian Rivers Inter-link]] his legacy project.  The core of the ideas relevant to the Telugu people here are i) Two medium scale projects be built to link western tributaries of Ganga to Godavari and Godavari to Krishna in Maharastra. These would allow the  transfer of about 1500 TMC of water per year from glacier fed river to peninsular rivers north of the Telugu states so that Maharastra and Karnataka can leave the natural flows of Krishna and Godavari to Telugu lands. ii) Linking eastern tributaries of Ganga/Brahmaputra to Manahandi and Mahanandi to Godavari to transfer 700 TMC of water in the east from glacier fed rivers to peninsular rivers. b) This transfer of water will allow ancillary small projects (no major burden to Telugu exchequer) of linking Godavari to Krishna, Krishna to Penna and Penna to Cauvery along the eastern border all the way to Tamil Nadu. As preexisting coastal deltas get stabilized, additionally linking of Godavari to Krishna at Dummugudam will allow arid Telugu lands to get reliably irrigated. This will put an end to all water sharing issues between all states. With the natural flow of Godavari unimpeded, no reverse pumping projects will be needed in northern Telangana, with eastern Godavari,Krishna,Penna and Cauvery deltas stabilized via the coastal linking of Godavari and Mahanadi, Rayalseema and south/west Telangana will be well irrigated by natural flows of Krishna with small scale irrigation projects.  Eastern and Central Telangana will benefit from Dummugudam project. The politics of water sharing will be replaced with the productive work of water planning.\n#NTR reduced the retirement age for government employees to 55 from 58. He used the National Security Act (NSA) to successfully crack down on the general strike called by government employee unions demanding bringing state government employees to central government employee pay levels.  He furloughed the entire work force of Housing Construction Corporation a state government organization will fully pay till retirement claiming they did absolutely no work and that closing that organization would save money even if the state gave the employees free salaries. He claimed the secretariat employees got in the way of doing people's business and moved his office to a private ashram outside the city.<ref name=\"Mishra 2000 275\u2013279\">{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Bhavana|title=Politics of opposition and union-state relations|year=2000|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.

He changed the mandate of government transportation to provide road service for under-served markets (villages). Every village got road service during his tenure. He was however unable to deliver on his promise to relax the 1976 Urban Land Ceiling Act and 1975 Agricultural Land Ceiling Act. He argued that the land ceiling act interfered with small local entrepreneurs but was providing case by case exemptions to the politically connected and multi-national-corporations.\n#NTR founded a national political coalition of non-Congress parties called The [[National Front (India)|National Front]] in 1989 and was elected its founding president.

He was the first non-[[Indian National Congress|Congress]] Chief Minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]], representing the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) founded by him in 1982. His first term lasted 1<small>&1/2</small> years from January 1983 to August 1984. He was ousted in a coup in August 1984, but returned to power a month later, which marked the beginning of his second term. He remained Chief Minister for the next five years, completing his full 5-year term as Chief Minister. In 1989, his party lost in the assembly elections, and it was not until 1994 that he would become Chief Minister again. His third and last term as Chief Minister only lasted nine months, from December 1994 to September 1995, following which his son-in-law Nara Chandrababu Naidu took over the party and became Chief Minister.\n\nThe political priorities of NTR during all his three terms as Chief Minister were widely debated, with the [[right-wing politics|right-wing parties]] accusing him of economic populism, the [[left-wing politics|left-wing parties]] accusing him of diverting resources away from government employee benefits and his supporters arguing that they were worthwhile investments into infrastructure, human resource development and social net programs.\n\n==Achievements==\n# After getting elected in 1983 his first legislation was the passing of  Andhra Pradesh upa lok pal (civil society OMBUDSMAN) bill inspired by Scandinavian laws.

He created a broad direction and implemented it under the able leadership of an educator [[Gali Muddu Krishnama Naidu]]. His direction was driven by considerations of a) future b)fairness c) economic competitiveness. On future he saw education is the vehicle for social transformation especially for the socially dis-advantaged and women. On fairness, expanding access to the best educational opportunities to the most deserving was seen as a vehicle for improving efficiency of the entire society. On Competitiveness, he observed that Telugu economy will one day be big and be mostly about serving Telugu population needs and in this economy a local advantage to local people will only happen if education was primarily in Telugu. He also observed that wealth would need trade and uniquely Telugu products sold outside will be the most valuable trade hence, preserving unique Telugu cultural advantages need to be enhanced with education. He also observed that trading with the world will be important and learning other languages would have to be an essential part of primary education especially English and Hindi. He pushed back on the argument that the rich in Telugu lands are doing it right by sending their kids to private English medium schools by saying, this behavior is a symptom of our desperation and past failures not a path for future success. He proposed a three-point formula for addressing this issue: i) Make all local government jobs/educational institution entrances and business to be in Telugu and Urudu so local kids have an inherent advantage and local private schools will have to teach Telugu ii) invest and revamp Telugu academy to continuously translate all the latest knowledge from around the world into Telugu iii) improve government schools and introduce English and Hindi as additional compulsory subjects like the other non-English speaking European countries. He subscribed to the modern European educational concept that learning in mother tongue is always easier than in a language used solely at school. The only future in which being solely educated in a foreign language will be helpful is an future where Telugu people cannot create an economy that provides for Telugu needs.     \n#Overhauled the entire state's education syllabus for schools. He instituted statewide entrance examinations for all disciplines of higher education vis-\u00e0-vis Engineering and Medicine to name a few called [[EAMCET]] (Engineering and Medical Common Entrance Test). Students, based on the merit of their ranks obtained in these tests, could join any state college of their choice.

While Mr.[[Kanuri Lakshmana Rao]] was a very ill octogenarian at the time, still created the blue print for the irrigation revolution that followed in the Telugu land. The key points of the comprehensive thought around irrigation were a) Southern rain fed rivers need to be linked with northern glacier fed rivers. This point was the core of NTR's contribution to irrigation, he unified the southern states around this idea and got Mr. [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] to declare [[Indian Rivers Inter-link]] his legacy project.  The core of the ideas relevant to the Telugu people here are i) Two medium scale projects be built to link western tributaries of Ganga to Godavari and Godavari to Krishna in Maharastra. These would allow the  transfer of about 1500 TMC of water per year from glacier fed river to peninsular rivers north of the Telugu states so that Maharastra and Karnataka can leave the natural flows of Krishna and Godavari to Telugu lands. ii) Linking eastern tributaries of Ganga/Brahmaputra to Manahandi and Mahanandi to Godavari to transfer 700 TMC of water in the east from glacier fed rivers to peninsular rivers. b) This transfer of water will allow ancillary small projects (no major burden to Telugu exchequer) of linking Godavari to Krishna, Krishna to Penna and Penna to Cauvery along the eastern border all the way to Tamil Nadu. As preexisting coastal deltas get stabilized, additionally linking of Godavari to Krishna at Dummugudam will allow arid Telugu lands to get reliably irrigated. This will put an end to all water sharing issues between all states. With the natural flow of Godavari unimpeded, no reverse pumping projects will be needed in northern Telangana, with eastern Godavari,Krishna,Penna and Cauvery deltas stabilized via the coastal linking of Godavari and Mahanadi, Rayalseema and south/west Telangana will be well irrigated by natural flows of Krishna with small scale irrigation projects.  Eastern and Central Telangana will benefit from Dummugudam project. The politics of water sharing will be replaced with the productive work of water planning.\n#NTR reduced the retirement age for government employees to 55 from 58. He used the National Security Act (NSA) to successfully crack down on the general strike called by government employee unions demanding bringing state government employees to central government employee pay levels.  He furloughed the entire work force of Housing Construction Corporation a state government organization will fully pay till retirement claiming they did absolutely no work and that closing that organization would save money even if the state gave the employees free salaries. He claimed the secretariat employees got in the way of doing people's business and moved his office to a private ashram outside the city.<ref name=\"Mishra 2000 275\u2013279\">{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Bhavana|title=Politics of opposition and union-state relations|year=2000|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.

He changed the mandate of government transportation to provide road service for under-served markets (villages). Every village got road service during his tenure. He was however unable to deliver on his promise to relax the 1976 Urban Land Ceiling Act and 1975 Agricultural Land Ceiling Act. He argued that the land ceiling act interfered with small local entrepreneurs but was providing case by case exemptions to the politically connected and multi-national-corporations.\n#NTR founded a national political coalition of non-Congress parties called The [[National Front (India)|National Front]] in 1989 and was elected its founding president. The National Front [[1989 Indian general election|came to power]] at the [[Government of India|centre]] the same year.

Under his tenure, he shifted the Telugu film industry from Chennai to Hyderabad, giving it a distinct identity from Tamil cinema and benefiting Telugu film producers and distributors and theater owners in Andhra Pradesh.<ref>http://www.deccanherald.com/content/54452/its-more-telangana-identity-development.html</ref>\n# NTR followed in the foot steps of [[Kasu Brahmananda Reddy]] (Who passed GO 36 and resigned voluntarily to make way for P.V.Narasimha Rao \u2013 a Telanganite)  and passed G.O 610 (requiring an audit and implementation of local reservations for telenganites) in December 1985 to be fully implemented by March 1986.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-22/hyderabad/35302177_1_bench-judicial-commission-employees-of-various-departments | work=The Times Of India | title=HC upholds GO 610; repatriated staff told to join duty \u2013 The Times of India | date=22 November 2012}}</ref> He further fought a case against GO 610 in the high court and won!! the right for the chief minister to implement G.0 610.

His support for P.V Narasimha Rao, as Prime Minister  by helping him win outside Telangana as an MP were very instrumental is furthering his United Andhra Stand.\n# NTR abolished [[Village accountant#PATWARI|Patel-Patwari system]] which was based on inheritance that dominated Telangana.\n# NTR initiated large scale decentralization of governance and accountability with his Mandal Praja Parishads (M.P.P).The Mandal Praja Parishad as a democratically elected body at Mandal level was introduced by NTR (NTR re-coined a Mughal era term \"Tehsil\" or revenue district into Mandal). Tehsils which were run by bureaucrats with the sole responsibility of tax collections till that point were now bringing political empowerment to groups who had difficulty aspiring to hold state level political office (MLA, MP, ZPTC Chairman etc.,). The extensive 50% reservations for SC/ST/BCs in MPPs and the fact that MPP presidents were directly elected by people living in the Mandal made local govt responsive to local needs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nag|first1=Kingshuk|title=Chronicle of an Agitation|date=November 2012|publisher=HarperCollins and India Today|pages=1922}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[N.

Some critics consider it inferior to ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' or ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'', but others rank it as the best of his work.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/22/reviews/chandler-goodbye.html Review of ''The Long Goodbye'', ''New York Times'', April 25, 1954.]</ref> Chandler, in a letter to a friend, called the novel \"my best book\".<ref name=hellsangels>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Raymond |title=The Raymond Chandler Papers: Selected Letters and Nonfiction, 1909\u20131959 |accessdate= |edition=Paperback |year=2000 |publisher=Grove Press Books |location= |isbn=0-8021-3946-9 |page=228 }}</ref>\n\nThe novel is notable for using hard-boiled detective fiction as a vehicle for [[social criticism]] and for including autobiographical elements from Chandler's life. In 1955, the novel received the [[Edgar Award]] for Best Novel. It was later adapted as a 1973 [[The Long Goodbye (film)|film of the same name]], updated to 1970s Los Angeles and starring [[Elliott Gould]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel opens outside a club called the Dancers. It is late October or early November. No specific year is given for when the events take place, but internal evidence and the publication date of the novel place them some time between 1949 and 1952. Philip Marlowe meets a drunk named Terry Lennox, a man with scars on one side of his face. They forge an uneasy friendship over the next few months. In June, Lennox shows up late one night at Marlowe's home in \"a great deal of trouble\" and needing a ride to the airport across the border in [[Tijuana]], Mexico. Marlowe agrees as long as Lennox does not tell him any details of why he is running.\n\nOn his return to Los Angeles, Marlowe learns that Lennox's wife was found dead in her guest house and that she died before Lennox fled. Marlowe is arrested on suspicion of murder after refusing to co-operate with investigators, who want him to confess that he helped Lennox flee.\n\nAfter three days of antagonizing his interrogators, Marlowe is released, the police explaining that Lennox has been reported to have committed suicide in [[Otatocl\u00e1n]] with a full written confession by his side. Marlowe gets home to find a cryptic note from Lennox containing a \"portrait of [[James Madison|Madison]]\" (a [[Large denominations of United States currency|$5,000 bill]]).\n[[Image:US $5000 1934 Federal Reserve Note.jpg|thumb|left|A \"portrait of Madison\"]]\nMarlowe gets a call from Howard Spencer, a New York publisher, who asks him to investigate a case. One of Spencer's best writers, Roger Wade, has a drinking problem and has been missing for three days. Initially Marlowe refuses, but after Wade's wife, Eileen, also asks for Marlowe's help, he consents. Marlowe finds Wade in a makeshift detox facility in an isolated and soon to be abandoned ranch. He takes his fee, but the Wades' stories do not match.\n\nThe Wades each try to convince Marlowe to stay at their house to keep Roger writing instead of drinking, and though he refuses, he ends up making further trips to the house at their behest. On one such trip, he finds Wade passed out in the grass with a cut on his head. Mrs. Wade enters a sort of trance and attempts to seduce Marlowe, thinking him to be a former lover of hers who died ten years earlier in [[World War&nbsp;II]].\n\nMeanwhile, Marlowe is repeatedly threatened to cease his investigation of the Lennox case, first by a friend of Lennox's named Mendy Menendez, then by Lennox's father-in-law, the police, the Wades' servant (a Chilean named Candy), and Wade's wife. Marlowe also learns that Terry Lennox had previously lived as Paul Marston, who was previously married and had lived in England.\n\nWade calls Marlowe again, asking him to come by to have lunch with him. Wade drinks himself into a stupor, so Marlowe takes a walk outside. When he returns, Eileen Wade is ringing the doorbell, saying she forgot her key. Marlowe finds Roger Wade dead on the couch, apparently from suicide, but Eileen accuses Marlowe of killing her husband. Candy fabricates a story to implicate Marlowe, believing him to be guilty, but his claims are undermined in an interrogation.\n\nMarlowe receives a call from Spencer regarding Wade's death and bullies Spencer into taking him to see Mrs. Wade. Once there, Marlowe grills her on the death of Terry Lennox's wife. Eileen first tries to blame it all on Roger, but Marlowe argues that she killed both Mrs. Lennox and Roger Wade and that Lennox was actually her first husband, presumed killed in action with British [[Special Air Service]] during the war. Eileen Wade leaves with no response. The next morning, Marlowe learns that she has killed herself, leaving a note confessing that she killed Mrs. Lennox and Roger Wade.\n\nMarlowe refuses to let the story lie. He is assaulted by Menendez, who is arrested in a setup arranged by a police commissioner who served with Menendez and Lennox during the war. Finally, Marlowe is visited by a Mexican man who claims to have been present when Lennox was killed in his hotel room. Marlowe listens to his story but rejects it and offers his own version, ending with the revelation the Mexican man is none other than Lennox, who has had cosmetic surgery.\n\n== Background ==\n''The Long Goodbye'' is Chandler's most personal novel. He wrote it as his wife was dying. Her illness and death had a profound effect on him, driving him into fits of melancholy and leading him to talk of and even to attempt suicide. Two characters in the novel are based on Chandler himself; both of them highlight Chandler's awareness of his own flaws\u2014his alcoholism and his doubts about the value of his writing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spender|first=Natasha|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Miriam|title=The World of Raymond Chandler|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofraymondch00miri|url-access=registration|year=1978|publisher=A & W Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89479-016-4|pages=(128\u2013150)|chapter=Chapter 11: His Own Long Goodbye}}</ref>\n\nThe character most clearly based on Chandler is the usually drunken writer Roger Wade. Like Chandler, Wade had a string of successful novels behind him, but as he grew older he found it more difficult to write. Also, like Chandler, Wade had written novels (romantic fiction) that were viewed by many as not real literature, whereas Wade wants to be thought of as a serious author. Wade also stands in for Chandler in discussions about literature, as in his praise of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].\n\nThe other Chandler stand-in is Terry Lennox. Like Chandler, Lennox is an alcoholic. Also like Chandler, he had fought in a war, and the war left emotional scars. For Lennox, it was the Second World War; for Chandler, it was the first. Lennox is a Canadian citizen, but he had spent a great deal of time in England and retained the restrained and formal attitude of an English gentleman. This made him somewhat of an anomaly in the fast-paced and more informal world of wealthy Los Angeles, which he inhabited because of his wife's money. Chandler was also raised in England and received a classical education there. Chandler also retained a great love for the English and what he viewed as their more civilised way of life compared to the shallowness and superficiality of Los Angeles. This frequently put him at odds with screenwriting collaborators, such as [[Billy Wilder]], and with most of Los Angeles and Hollywood society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Houseman|first=John|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Miriam|title=The World of Raymond Chandler|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofraymondch00miri|url-access=registration|year=1978|publisher=A & W Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89479-016-4|pages=(55)|chapter=Chapter 5: Lost Fortnight}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilder|first=Billy|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Miriam|title=The World of Raymond Chandler|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofraymondch00miri|url-access=registration|year=1978|publisher=A & W Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89479-016-4|page=(46)|chapter=Chapter 4: On the Fourth Floor at Paramount}}</ref>\n\n==Film, television and radio adaptations==\nThis novel was dramatised for television in 1954 for the anthology series ''[[Climax!]]'', with [[Dick Powell]] playing Marlowe, as he had a decade earlier in the film ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]''. This live telecast is memorable for an incident in which the actor [[Tris Coffin]], whose character had just died, thinking he was out of camera range, stood up and walked away while in view of the TV audience.\n\nIn 1973, [[Robert Altman]] filmed an [[The Long Goodbye (film)|adaptation]] set in contemporary Los Angeles, with [[Elliott Gould]] as Marlowe.\n\nAn adaptation of the novel was broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 16 January 1978, with [[Ed Bishop]] as Marlowe, and again on 1 October 2011, with [[Toby Stephens]] as Marlowe as part of its Classic Chandler series. Japanese broadcaster [[NHK]] aired five episodes of a Japanese adaptation of the novel in 2014.\n\n==Appearances in other works==\n''The Long Goodbye'' has been referred to in other works of fiction. [[Greg Iles]] referred to Chandler and the novel's title in his own novel ''[[The Quiet Game]]'', in which one chararacter is named Marston.<ref>''The Quiet Game'', paperback edition, pp. 34, 102.</ref> It has been featured in the Japanese [[tokusatsu]] drama [[Kamen Rider W]], in which the main character constantly reads from a Japanese version of the book.

Some critics consider it inferior to ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' or ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'', but others rank it as the best of his work.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/22/reviews/chandler-goodbye.html Review of ''The Long Goodbye'', ''New York Times'', April 25, 1954.]</ref> Chandler, in a letter to a friend, called the novel \"my best book\".<ref name=hellsangels>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Raymond |title=The Raymond Chandler Papers: Selected Letters and Nonfiction, 1909\u20131959 |accessdate= |edition=Paperback |year=2000 |publisher=Grove Press Books |location= |isbn=0-8021-3946-9 |page=228 }}</ref>\n\nThe novel is notable for using hard-boiled detective fiction as a vehicle for [[social criticism]] and for including autobiographical elements from Chandler's life. In 1955, the novel received the [[Edgar Award]] for Best Novel. It was later adapted as a 1973 [[The Long Goodbye (film)|film of the same name]], updated to 1970s Los Angeles and starring [[Elliott Gould]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel opens outside a club called the Dancers. It is late October or early November. No specific year is given for when the events take place, but internal evidence and the publication date of the novel place them some time between 1949 and 1952. Philip Marlowe meets a drunk named Terry Lennox, a man with scars on one side of his face. They forge an uneasy friendship over the next few months. In June, Lennox shows up late one night at Marlowe's home in \"a great deal of trouble\" and needing a ride to the airport across the border in [[Tijuana]], Mexico. Marlowe agrees as long as Lennox does not tell him any details of why he is running.\n\nOn his return to Los Angeles, Marlowe learns that Lennox's wife was found dead in her guest house and that she died before Lennox fled. Marlowe is arrested on suspicion of murder after refusing to co-operate with investigators, who want him to confess that he helped Lennox flee.\n\nAfter three days of antagonizing his interrogators, Marlowe is released, the police explaining that Lennox has been reported to have committed suicide in [[Otatocl\u00e1n]] with a full written confession by his side. Marlowe gets home to find a cryptic note from Lennox containing a \"portrait of [[James Madison|Madison]]\" (a [[Large denominations of United States currency|$5,000 bill]]).\n[[Image:US $5000 1934 Federal Reserve Note.jpg|thumb|left|A \"portrait of Madison\"]]\nMarlowe gets a call from Howard Spencer, a New York publisher, who asks him to investigate a case. One of Spencer's best writers, Roger Wade, has a drinking problem and has been missing for three days. Initially Marlowe refuses, but after Wade's wife, Eileen, also asks for Marlowe's help, he consents. Marlowe finds Wade in a makeshift detox facility in an isolated and soon to be abandoned ranch. He takes his fee, but the Wades' stories do not match.\n\nThe Wades each try to convince Marlowe to stay at their house to keep Roger writing instead of drinking, and though he refuses, he ends up making further trips to the house at their behest. On one such trip, he finds Wade passed out in the grass with a cut on his head. Mrs. Wade enters a sort of trance and attempts to seduce Marlowe, thinking him to be a former lover of hers who died ten years earlier in [[World War&nbsp;II]].\n\nMeanwhile, Marlowe is repeatedly threatened to cease his investigation of the Lennox case, first by a friend of Lennox's named Mendy Menendez, then by Lennox's father-in-law, the police, the Wades' servant (a Chilean named Candy), and Wade's wife. Marlowe also learns that Terry Lennox had previously lived as Paul Marston, who was previously married and had lived in England.\n\nWade calls Marlowe again, asking him to come by to have lunch with him. Wade drinks himself into a stupor, so Marlowe takes a walk outside. When he returns, Eileen Wade is ringing the doorbell, saying she forgot her key. Marlowe finds Roger Wade dead on the couch, apparently from suicide, but Eileen accuses Marlowe of killing her husband. Candy fabricates a story to implicate Marlowe, believing him to be guilty, but his claims are undermined in an interrogation.\n\nMarlowe receives a call from Spencer regarding Wade's death and bullies Spencer into taking him to see Mrs. Wade. Once there, Marlowe grills her on the death of Terry Lennox's wife. Eileen first tries to blame it all on Roger, but Marlowe argues that she killed both Mrs. Lennox and Roger Wade and that Lennox was actually her first husband, presumed killed in action with British [[Special Air Service]] during the war. Eileen Wade leaves with no response. The next morning, Marlowe learns that she has killed herself, leaving a note confessing that she killed Mrs. Lennox and Roger Wade.\n\nMarlowe refuses to let the story lie. He is assaulted by Menendez, who is arrested in a setup arranged by a police commissioner who served with Menendez and Lennox during the war. Finally, Marlowe is visited by a Mexican man who claims to have been present when Lennox was killed in his hotel room. Marlowe listens to his story but rejects it and offers his own version, ending with the revelation the Mexican man is none other than Lennox, who has had cosmetic surgery.\n\n== Background ==\n''The Long Goodbye'' is Chandler's most personal novel. He wrote it as his wife was dying. Her illness and death had a profound effect on him, driving him into fits of melancholy and leading him to talk of and even to attempt suicide. Two characters in the novel are based on Chandler himself; both of them highlight Chandler's awareness of his own flaws\u2014his alcoholism and his doubts about the value of his writing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spender|first=Natasha|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Miriam|title=The World of Raymond Chandler|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofraymondch00miri|url-access=registration|year=1978|publisher=A & W Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89479-016-4|pages=(128\u2013150)|chapter=Chapter 11: His Own Long Goodbye}}</ref>\n\nThe character most clearly based on Chandler is the usually drunken writer Roger Wade. Like Chandler, Wade had a string of successful novels behind him, but as he grew older he found it more difficult to write. Also, like Chandler, Wade had written novels (romantic fiction) that were viewed by many as not real literature, whereas Wade wants to be thought of as a serious author. Wade also stands in for Chandler in discussions about literature, as in his praise of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].\n\nThe other Chandler stand-in is Terry Lennox. Like Chandler, Lennox is an alcoholic. Also like Chandler, he had fought in a war, and the war left emotional scars. For Lennox, it was the Second World War; for Chandler, it was the first. Lennox is a Canadian citizen, but he had spent a great deal of time in England and retained the restrained and formal attitude of an English gentleman. This made him somewhat of an anomaly in the fast-paced and more informal world of wealthy Los Angeles, which he inhabited because of his wife's money. Chandler was also raised in England and received a classical education there. Chandler also retained a great love for the English and what he viewed as their more civilised way of life compared to the shallowness and superficiality of Los Angeles. This frequently put him at odds with screenwriting collaborators, such as [[Billy Wilder]], and with most of Los Angeles and Hollywood society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Houseman|first=John|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Miriam|title=The World of Raymond Chandler|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofraymondch00miri|url-access=registration|year=1978|publisher=A & W Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89479-016-4|pages=(55)|chapter=Chapter 5: Lost Fortnight}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilder|first=Billy|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Miriam|title=The World of Raymond Chandler|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofraymondch00miri|url-access=registration|year=1978|publisher=A & W Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89479-016-4|page=(46)|chapter=Chapter 4: On the Fourth Floor at Paramount}}</ref>\n\n==Film, television and radio adaptations==\nThis novel was dramatised for television in 1954 for the anthology series ''[[Climax!]]'', with [[Dick Powell]] playing Marlowe, as he had a decade earlier in the film ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]''. This live telecast is memorable for an incident in which the actor [[Tris Coffin]], whose character had just died, thinking he was out of camera range, stood up and walked away while in view of the TV audience.\n\nIn 1973, [[Robert Altman]] filmed an [[The Long Goodbye (film)|adaptation]] set in contemporary Los Angeles, with [[Elliott Gould]] as Marlowe.\n\nAn adaptation of the novel was broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 16 January 1978, with [[Ed Bishop]] as Marlowe, and again on 1 October 2011, with [[Toby Stephens]] as Marlowe as part of its Classic Chandler series. Japanese broadcast [[NHK]] aired five episodes of a Japanese adaptation of the novel in 2014.\n\n==Appearances in other works==\n''The Long Goodbye'' has been referred to in other works of fiction.

It is thought to be the earliest example of man-made flight. [[Ibn Firnas]] built the first [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]] and attempted some flights. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s 15th-century dream of flight found expression in several rational but unscientific designs, though he did not attempt to construct any of them.\n\nThe discovery of [[hydrogen]] gas in the 18th century led to the invention of the [[hydrogen balloon]], at almost exactly the same time that [[Montgolfier brothers|the Montgolfier brothers]] rediscovered the hot-air balloon and began manned flights.<ref name=\"wings-tom\">{{cite book |last1=Crouch |first1=Tom |title=Wings: A History of Aviation from Kites to the Space Age |publisher=W.W.

The modern [[aeroplane]] with its characteristic tail was established by 1909 and from then on the history of the aeroplane became tied to the development of more and more powerful engines.\n\nThe first great ships of the air were the rigid dirigible balloons pioneered by [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], which soon became synonymous with [[airship]]s and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large [[flying boat]]s became popular. After [[World War II]], the flying boats were in their turn replaced by land planes, and the new and immensely powerful [[jet engine]] revolutionised both air travel and [[military aviation]].\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century the advent of digital electronics produced great advances in flight instrumentation and \"fly-by-wire\" systems. The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless drones for military, civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings became possible.\n\n==Primitive beginnings==\n{{Main|Early flying machines}}\n\n===Tower jumping===\n[[File:Daedalus und Ikarus MK1888.png|thumb|[[Daedalus]] working on [[Icarus]]' wings.]]\nSince antiquity there have been stories of men strapping birdlike wings, stiffened cloaks or other devices to themselves and attempting to fly, typically by jumping off a tower. The Greek legend of [[Daedalus and Icarus#Daedalus and Icarus|Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]] is one of the earliest known; others originated from India, China and the European Middle Age.

According to [[Joseph Needham]], such lanterns were known in China from the 3rd century BC.

While theoretically sound, his design was not feasible: the pressure of the surrounding air would crush the spheres.  The idea of using a vacuum to produce lift is now known as [[vacuum airship]] but remains unfeasible with any current [[materials science|materials]].\n \nIn 1709, [[Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o]] presented a petition to King [[John V of Portugal]], begging for support for his invention of an airship, in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The public test of the machine, which was set for 24 June 1709, did not take place. According to contemporary reports, however, Gusm\u00e3o appears to have made several less ambitious experiments with this machine, descending from eminences. It is certain that Gusm\u00e3o was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before the Court on 8 August 1709, in the hall of the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]] in [[Lisbon]], when he propelled a ball to the roof by combustion.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== Balloons ===\n{{Main|History of ballooning}}\n {{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 340 | footer = Lithographic depiction of pioneering events (1783 to 1846). | image1 = Early flight 02562u.jpg | image2 = Early flight 02561u.jpg }}\n\n1783 was a watershed year for ballooning and aviation. Between 4 June and 1 December, five aviation firsts were achieved in France:\n* On 4 June, the [[Montgolfier brothers]] demonstrated their unmanned [[hot air balloon]] at [[Annonay]], France.\n* On 27 August, [[Jacques Charles]] and the [[Robert brothers]] (''[[Robert brothers|Les Freres Robert]]'') launched the world's first unmanned hydrogen-filled balloon, from the [[Champ de Mars]], Paris.\n* On 19 October, the Montgolfiers launched the first manned flight, a tethered balloon with humans on board, at the ''[[Folie Titon]]'' in Paris. The aviators were the scientist [[Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier]], the manufacture manager [[Jean-Baptiste R\u00e9veillon]], and Giroud de Villette.\n* On 21 November, the Montgolfiers launched the first free flight with human passengers. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier, along with the [[Fran\u00e7ois Laurent d'Arlandes|Marquis Fran\u00e7ois d'Arlandes]], successfully petitioned for the honor. They drifted {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a balloon-powered by a wood fire.\n* On 1 December, Jacques Charles and the [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]] launched their manned hydrogen balloon from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] in Paris, as a crowd of 400,000 witnessed. They ascended to a height of about {{convert|1,800|ft|m}}[15] and landed at sunset in [[Nesles-la-Vall\u00e9e]] after a flight of 2 hours and 5 minutes, covering 36&nbsp;km. After Robert alighted Charles decided to ascend alone. This time he ascended rapidly to an altitude of about {{convert|9,800|ft|m}}, where he saw the sun again, suffered extreme pain in his ears, and never flew again.\n\nBallooning became a major \"rage\" in Europe in the late 18th century, providing the first detailed understanding of the relationship between altitude and the atmosphere.\n\nNon-steerable balloons were employed during the [[American Civil War]] by the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]]. The young [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin#Army career|Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] first flew as a balloon passenger with the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] in 1863.\n\nIn the early 1900s, ballooning was a popular sport in Britain. These privately owned balloons usually used [[coal gas]] as the lifting gas. This has half the lifting power of hydrogen so the balloons had to be larger, however, coal gas was far more readily available and the local gas works sometimes provided a special lightweight formula for ballooning events.<ref>Walker (1971) Volume I, Page 195.</ref>\n\n=== Airships ===\n{{Main|Airship|Zeppelin}}\n\n[[File:Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution (1901) - Flickr 18436256195.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Santos-Dumont's \"Number 6\" rounding the Eiffel Tower in the process of winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe Prize, October 1901.]]\nAirships were originally called \"dirigible balloons\" and are still sometimes called dirigibles today.\n\nWork on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when [[Henri Giffard]] flew {{convert|15|mi|km}} in France, with a steam engine driven craft.\n\nAnother advance was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, ''[[La France (airship)|La France]]'', by [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Krebs]]. The {{Convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{Convert|66000|cuft|m3|adj=on}} airship covered {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8\u00bd horsepower electric motor.\n\nHowever, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail. Routine, controlled flights would not occur until the advent of the internal combustion engine (see below.)\n\nThe first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were [[non-rigid airship]]s (sometimes called \"blimps\".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this type of aircraft was the Brazilian [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] who effectively combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he flew his airship ''Number 6'' over Paris from the [[Parc de Saint Cloud]] around the [[Eiffel Tower]] and back in under 30 minutes to win the [[Deutsch de la Meurthe prize]]. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.\n\nAt the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success, the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These would be far more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo carrying capacity for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]].\n\nConstruction of the first [[Zeppelin]] airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, [[Friedrichshafen]]. This was intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned with the wind. The prototype airship ''[[Zeppelin LZ1|LZ 1]]'' (LZ for \"Luftschiff Zeppelin\") had a length of {{convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on}} was driven by two {{convert|10.6|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] engines and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.\n\nIts first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent flights, bettering the 6&nbsp;m/s speed attained by the French airship ''La France'' by 3&nbsp;m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It would be several years before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.\n\nAlthough airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by heavier-than-air craft.\n\n==Heavier than air==\n{{main|Early flying machines}}\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nItalian inventor [[Tito Livio Burattini]], invited by the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] to his court in [[Warsaw]], built a model aircraft with four fixed [[Glider aircraft|glider]] wings in 1647.<ref>{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|title=[[Science and Civilisation in China]]|volume=IV (part 2)|year=1965|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGyrCfYs2AC&pg=PA591 591]|isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}</ref>  Described as \"four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'\", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.<ref name=\"harrison27\">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=James Pinckney|year=2000|title=Mastering the Sky|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JwJsr5QjkRMC&pg=PA27 27]|isbn=978-1-885119-68-1}}</ref> He promised that \"only the most minor injuries\" would result from landing the craft.<ref name=\"oconner-1985\">Qtd. in {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/books/in-short-nonfiction-man-was-meant-to-fly-but-not-at-first.html|title=In Short: Nonfiction; Man Was Meant to Fly, But Not at First|last=O'Conner|first=Patricia T.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 November 1985|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> His \"Dragon Volant\" is considered \"the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century\".<ref>[\"Burattini's Flying Dragon\", FLIGHT International, 9 May 1963 | {{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200722.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819221108/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200722.html |archivedate=19 August 2016}}]</ref>\n\nThe first published paper on aviation was [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)|\"Sketch of a Machine for Flying in the Air\"]] by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] published in 1716. This flying machine consisted of a light frame covered with strong canvas and provided with two large oars or wings moving on a horizontal axis, arranged so that the upstroke met with no resistance while the downstroke provided lifting power. Swedenborg knew that the machine would not fly, but suggested it as a start and was confident that the problem would be solved. He wrote: \"It seems easier to talk of such a machine than to put it into actuality, for it requires greater force and less weight than exists in a human body. The science of mechanics might perhaps suggest a means, namely, a strong spiral spring. If these advantages and requisites are observed, perhaps in time to come someone might know how better to utilize our sketch and cause some addition to be made so as to accomplish that which we can only suggest. Yet there are sufficient proofs and examples from nature that such flights can take place without danger, although when the first trials are made you may have to pay for the experience, and not mind an arm or leg\". Swedenborg would prove prescient in his observation that a method of powering of an aircraft was one of the critical problems to be overcome.\n\nOn 16 May 1793, the Spanish inventor [[Diego Mar\u00edn Aguilera]] managed to cross the river Arandilla in [[Coru\u00f1a del Conde]], [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]], flying 300 \u2013 400 m, with a flying machine.<ref name=\"aiaa\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=370 |title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \u2013 History \u2013 Spain |publisher=Aiaa.org |date=22 April 2019 |access-date=22 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110054948/https://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=370 |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nBalloon jumping replaced tower jumping, also demonstrating with typically fatal results that man-power and flapping wings were useless in achieving flight.

Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly. It is preserved in the [[Musee de l'Air]], France, and is claimed to be the earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.\n\nThe Englishman [[Horatio Phillips]] made key contributions to aerodynamics. He conducted extensive wind tunnel research on [[aerofoil]] sections, proving the principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings underpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883\u20131886, the American [[John Joseph Montgomery]] developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting his own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift.\n\n[[File:More otho flying.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Otto Lilienthal]], 29 May 1895.]]\n[[Otto Lilienthal]] became known as the \"Glider King\" or \"Flying Man\" of Germany. He duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his research in 1889 as ''Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation'' (''Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst''). He also produced a series of [[hang glider]]s, including bat-wing, monoplane and biplane forms, such as the [[Derwitzer Glider]] and [[Normal soaring apparatus]]. Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air machine, stimulating interest around the world. He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000 glides until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider crash.\n\nPicking up where Lilienthal left off, [[Octave Chanute]] took up aircraft design after an early retirement, and funded the development of several gliders. In the summer of 1896, his team flew several of their designs eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented and photographed his work.\n\nIn Britain [[Percy Pilcher]], who had worked for Maxim, built and successfully flew several [[Glider aircraft|gliders]] during the mid to late 1890s.\n\nThe invention of the [[box kite]] during this period by the Australian [[Lawrence Hargrave]] would lead to the development of the practical [[biplane]]. In 1894, Hargrave linked four of his kites together, added a sling seat, and was the first to obtain lift with a heavier than air aircraft, when he flew up {{convert|16|ft|m}}. Later pioneers of manned kite flying included [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] in England and Captain G\u00e9nie Saconney in France.\n\n=== Langley ===\n{{Main|Samuel Pierpont Langley}}\n[[File:Samuel Pierpont Langley - Potomac experiment 1903.jpeg|thumb|right|First failure of Langley's manned ''Aerodrome'' on the [[Potomac River]], 7 October 1903]]\n\nAfter a distinguished career in [[astronomy]] and shortly before becoming Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] started a serious investigation into aerodynamics at what is today the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1891, he published ''Experiments in Aerodynamics'' detailing his research, and then turned to building his designs. He hoped to achieve automatic aerodynamic stability, so he gave little consideration to in-flight control.<ref name=Anderson2004>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=IYnl_XPggZYC&pg=PA145 |page=145 |last=Anderson |first=John David |title=Inventing Flight: The Wright Brothers & Their Predecessors |publisher=JHU Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8018-6875-0}}</ref> On 6 May 1896, Langley's ''Aerodrome No. 5'' made the first successful sustained flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of {{Convert|1005|m|ft}} and a second of {{Convert|700|m|ft}}, at a speed of approximately {{Convert|25|mi/h|km/h}}. On both occasions, the ''Aerodrome No. 5'' landed in the water as planned, because, in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On 28 November 1896, another successful flight was made with the ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;6''. This flight, of {{Convert|1460|m|ft}}, was witnessed and photographed by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;6'' was actually ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;4'' greatly modified. So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation.\n\nWith the successes of the ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;5'' and ''No.&nbsp;6'', Langley started looking for funding to build a full-scale man-carrying version of his designs. Spurred by the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the U.S. government granted him $50,000 to develop a man-carrying flying machine for aerial reconnaissance. Langley planned on building a scaled-up version known as the '''Aerodrome&nbsp;A''', and started with the smaller '''Quarter-scale Aerodrome''', which flew twice on 18 June 1901, and then again with a newer and more powerful engine in 1903.\n\nWith the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to the problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one, but was disappointed when it delivered only {{convert|8|hp|kW|abbr=on}} instead of {{convert|12|hp|kW|abbr=on}} he expected. Langley's assistant, [[Charles M. Manly]], then reworked the design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered {{convert|52|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 950&nbsp;rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with both power and a design, Langley put the two together with great hopes.\n\nTo his dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. Simply scaling up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the ''Aerodrome'' immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time. Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the ''Aerodrome''{{'}}s aerial stability was marginal.<ref name=Anderson2004 />\n\nLangley's attempts to gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine days after his second abortive launch on 8 December, the [[Wright brothers]] successfully flew their ''Flyer''. [[Glenn Curtiss]] made 93 modifications to the ''Aerodrome'' and flew this very different aircraft in 1914.<ref name=Anderson2004 /> Without acknowledging the modifications, the Smithsonian Institution asserted that Langley's ''Aerodrome'' was the first machine \"capable of flight\".<ref>Hallion (2003) pages 294\u2013295.</ref>\n\n===Whitehead===\n{{Main|Gustave Whitehead}}\n[[File:Plane rear w crew.jpg|thumb|right|The No. 21 monoplane seen from the rear.

From 1897 to 1915, he designed and built early flying machines and engines. On 14 August 1901, two and a half years before the Wright Brothers' flight, he claimed to have carried out a controlled, powered flight in his [[Whitehead No. 21|Number 21 monoplane]] at [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], Connecticut.

About 30 years later, several people questioned by a researcher claimed to have seen that or other Whitehead flights.\n\nIn March 2013, ''[[Jane's All the World's Aircraft]]'', an authoritative source for contemporary aviation, published an editorial which accepted Whitehead's flight as the first manned, powered, controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft.<ref>Paul Jackson; [http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065976994 ''Executive Overview: Jane's All the World's Aircraft: Development & Production \u2013 'Justice delayed is justice denied' ''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313075911/http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065976994 |date=13 March 2013 }} (2013)</ref> The [[Smithsonian Institution]] (custodians of the original [[Wright Flyer]]) and many aviation historians continue to maintain that Whitehead did not fly as suggested.<ref>Budd Davisson; [http://www.flightjournal.com/blog/2013/03/25/who-was-first-the-wrights-or-whitehead/ ''Who Was First?

The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their 19th-century predecessors. Their first glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own [[wind tunnel]] and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested.<ref name=Dodson>{{Citation |author=Dodson, MG |title=An Historical and Applied Aerodynamic Study of the Wright Brothers' Wind Tunnel Test Program and Application to Successful Manned Flight |journal=[[United States Naval Academy|US Naval Academy]] Technical Report |volume=USNA-334 |year=2005 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3585 |accessdate=11 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905162319/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3585 |archive-date=5 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher [[aspect ratio]] and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models. By using a rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft, the [[Wright Flyer]], but also helped advance the science of aeronautical engineering.\n\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Wright Flyer]]: the first sustained flight with a powered, controlled aircraft.]]\nThe Wrights appear to be the first to make serious studied attempts to simultaneously solve the power and control problems. Both problems proved difficult, but they never lost interest. They solved the control problem by inventing [[wing warping]] for [[Roll (flight)|roll]] control, combined with simultaneous [[Yaw axis|yaw]] control with a steerable rear rudder. Almost as an afterthought, they designed and built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind. Performance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design because the [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] could not be highly loaded; [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] wings were less affected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability.\n\nAccording to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] (FAI),<ref>[http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/ Smithsonian Institution, \"The Wright Brothers & The Invention of the Aerial Age\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502100132/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/ |date=2 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/000295.asp \"100 Years Ago, the Dream of Icarus Became Reality.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113080326/http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/000295.asp |date=13 January 2011 }} ''FAI NEWS'', 17 December 2003.

In May 1904 they introduced the [[Wright Flyer II|Flyer II]], a heavier and improved version of the original Flyer. On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the [[Wright Flyer III|Flyer III]]. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] and rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two fixed vertical vanes (called \"blinkers\") between the elevators and gave the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device), flying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to the starting point safely and landing without damage.

The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] both used airplanes and airships extensively.\n\nWhile the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I,<ref>with the exception of Cl\u00e9ment Ader, who had visionary views about this: \"L'affaire de l'aviation militaire\" (Military aviation concern), 1898 and \"La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l'aviation militaire en France\" (The first step of military aviation en France), 1906</ref> the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached to their [[reconnaissance]] departments. [[Radiotelephone]]s were also being explored on airplanes, notably the [[SCR-68 Airplane Radio Telephone|SCR-68]], as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important.\n\n==World War I (1914\u20131918)==\n{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}\n[[File:GermanFightingMonoplane1917.jpg|thumb|upright|German [[Etrich Taube|Taube]] [[monoplane]], illustration from 1917]]\n\n=== Combat schemes ===\n{{See also|Flying ace|List of World War I flying aces|Aerial victory standards of World War I}}\n\nIt was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this problem when, in late 1914, [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane, but while [[Adolphe Pegoud]] would become known as the first \"[[flying ace|ace]]\", getting credit for five victories, before also becoming the first ace to die in action, it was German [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] Leutnant [[Kurt Wintgens]], who, on 1 July 1915, scored the very first aerial victory by a [[Fokker E.I|purpose-built fighter plane]], with a [[synchronization gear|synchronized machine gun]].\n\nAviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most well known is [[Manfred von Richthofen]], better known as the '''Red Baron''', who shot down 80 planes in [[air-to-air combat]] with several different planes, the most celebrated of which was the [[Fokker Dr.I]]. On the Allied side, [[Ren\u00e9 Paul Fonck]] is credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are considered.\n\nFrance, Britain, Germany and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter planes that saw action during the war,<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/statistics.php WWI airplane statistics by nation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035345/http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/statistics.php |date=15 March 2016 }}</ref> with German aviation technologist [[Hugo Junkers]] showing the way to the future  through his [[Junkers J 1|pioneering use of all-metal aircraft]] from late 1915.\n\n==Between the World Wars (1918\u20131939)==\n{{main|Aviation between the World Wars}}\nThe years between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] saw great advancements in aircraft technology. Airplanes evolved from low-powered biplanes made from wood and fabric to sleek, high-powered monoplanes made of aluminum, based primarily on the founding work of [[Hugo Junkers]] during the World War I period and its adoption by American designer [[William Bushnell Stout]] and Soviet designer [[Andrei Tupolev]]. The age of the great rigid airships came and went. The first successful rotorcraft appeared in the form of the [[autogyro]], invented by Spanish engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] and first flown in 1919. In this design, the rotor is not powered but is spun like a windmill by its passage through the air. A separate powerplant is used to propel the aircraft forwards.\n\n[[File:Flagg biplane.jpg|thumb|left|Flagg biplane from 1933.]]\nAfter World War I, experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their skills. Many American pilots became [[barnstorming|barnstormers]], flying into small towns across the country and showing off their flying abilities, as well as taking paying passengers for rides. Eventually, the barnstormers grouped into more organized displays. Air shows sprang up around the country, with air races, acrobatic stunts, and feats of air superiority. The air races drove engine and airframe development\u2014the [[Schneider Trophy]], for example, led to a series of ever faster and sleeker [[monoplane]] designs culminating in the [[Supermarine S.6B]]. With pilots competing for cash prizes, there was an incentive to go faster. [[Amelia Earhart]] was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming/air show circuit. She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as the crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\n[[File:DeHavilland DH50 biplane.jpg|thumb|Qantas De Havilland biplane, c. 1930]]\nOther prizes, for distance and speed records, also drove development forwards. For example, on 14 June 1919, Captain [[Alcock and Brown|John Alcock]] and Lieutenant [[Alcock and Brown|Arthur Brown]] co-piloted a [[Vickers Vimy]] non-stop from St. John's, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] to Clifden, Ireland, winning the \u00a313,000 ($65,000)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nevin |first=David |title=Two Daring Flyers Beat the Atlantic before Lindbergh |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=1993 |page=105}}</ref> [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|Northcliffe prize]]. The first flight across the South Atlantic and the first aerial crossing using astronomical navigation, was made by the naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922, from [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], with only internal means of navigation, in an aircraft specifically fitted for himself with an [[artificial horizon]] for aeronautical use, an invention that revolutionized air navigation at the time (Gago Coutinho invented a type of [[sextant]] incorporating two spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon).<ref name=\"FIDEHAE\">[http://www.incaer.aer.mil.br/opusculo_trav_atlantico_sul.pdf CAMBESES J\u00daNIOR, Manuel, ''A Primeira Travessia A\u00e9rea do Atl\u00e2ntico Sul'', Bras\u00edlia: INCAER, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211206/http://www.incaer.aer.mil.br/opusculo_trav_atlantico_sul.pdf |date=14 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm History of the Sextant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200611/http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm |date=3 March 2016 }} includes a photograph of a Gago Coutinho spirit level attachment.</ref> Five years later [[Charles Lindbergh]] took the [[Orteig Prize]] of $25,000 for the first ''solo'' non-stop crossing of the Atlantic. Months after Lindbergh, Paul Redfern was the first to solo the Caribbean Sea and was last seen flying over Venezuela.\n\nAustralian Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] was the first to fly across the larger Pacific Ocean in the Southern Cross. His crew left Oakland, California to make the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia in three stages. The first (from Oakland to Hawaii) was {{convert|2400|mi|km}}, took 27 hours 25 minutes, and was uneventful. They then flew to Suva, Fiji {{convert|3100|mi|km}} away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the toughest part of the journey as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. They then flew on to Brisbane in 20 hours, where they landed on 9 June 1928 after approximately {{convert|7400|mi|km}} total flight. On arrival, Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 25,000 at Eagle Farm Airport in his hometown of Brisbane. Accompanying him were Australian aviator [[Charles Ulm]] as the relief pilot, and the Americans James Warner and Captain Harry Lyon (who were the radio operator, navigator and engineer). A week after they landed, Kingsford Smith and Ulm recorded a disc for Columbia talking about their trip. With Ulm, Kingsford Smith later continued his journey being the first in 1929 to [[First aerial circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]], crossing the equator twice.\n\nThe first lighter-than-air crossings of the Atlantic were made by airship in July 1919 by His Majesty's Airship [[R34 (airship)|R34]] and crew when they flew from [[East Lothian]], Scotland to [[Long Island]], New York and then back to [[RNAS Pulham|Pulham]], England. By 1929, airship technology had advanced to the point that the first round-the-world flight was completed by the ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' in September and in October, the same aircraft inaugurated the first commercial transatlantic service. However, the age of the rigid airship ended following the destruction by fire of the zeppelin LZ 129 [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] just before landing at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]] on 6 May 1937, killing 35 of the 97 people aboard. Previous spectacular airship accidents, from the ''[[Wingfoot Air Express Crash|Wingfoot Express]]'' disaster (1919) to the loss of the [[R101]] (1930), the [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|''Akron'']] (1933) and the [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''Macon'']] (1935) had already cast doubt on airship safety, but with the disasters of the U.S. Navy's rigids showing the importance of solely using [[helium]] as the lifting medium; following the destruction of the Hindenburg, the remaining airship making [[international flight]]s, the ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the rigid airship ''[[Graf Zeppelin II]]'', made a number of flights, primarily over Germany, from 1938 to 1939, but was grounded when Germany began [[World War II]]. Both remaining German zeppelins were scrapped in 1940 to supply metal for the German [[Luftwaffe]]; the last American rigid airship, the ''[[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|Los Angeles]]'', which had not flown since 1932, was dismantled in late 1939.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany, which was restricted by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in its development of powered aircraft, developed [[gliding]] as a sport, especially at the [[Wasserkuppe]], during the 1920s. In its various forms, in the 21st century sailplane aviation now has over 400,000 participants.<ref>{{Citation| url = http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership| title = FAI membership summary| accessdate = 24 August 2006| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810060357/http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership| archivedate = 10 August 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/awards/badges/new_badges FAI web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811162150/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/awards/badges/new_badges |date=11 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, [[Jimmy Doolittle#Instrument flight|Jimmy Doolittle]] developed [[Flight instruments|instrument flight]].\n\n1929 also saw the first flight of by far the largest plane ever built until then: the [[Dornier Do X]] with a wingspan of 48 m. On its 70th test flight on 21 October 1929, there were 169 people on board, a record that was not broken for 20 years.\n\nLess than a decade after the development of the first practical rotorcraft of any type with the autogyro, in the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, two aeronautical engineers working at the ''[[TsAGI|Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut]]'', constructed and flew the TsAGI 1-EA single rotor helicopter, which used an open tubing framework, a four-blade main rotor, and twin sets of {{convert|1.8|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter anti-torque rotors; one set of two at the nose and one set of two at the tail. Powered by two M-2 powerplants, up-rated copies of the [[Gnome Monosoupape]] rotary radial engine of World War I, the TsAGI 1-EA [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx565dqF-5M made several successful low altitude flights]. By 14 August 1932, Cheremukhin managed to get the 1-EA up to an unofficial altitude of {{convert|605|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with what is likely to be the first successful single-lift rotor helicopter design ever tested and flown.\n\nOnly five years after the German Dornier Do-X had flown, Tupolev designed the largest aircraft of the 1930s era, the [[Tupolev ANT-20|''Maksim Gorky'']] in the Soviet Union by 1934, as the largest aircraft ever built using the Junkers methods of metal aircraft construction.\n\nIn the 1930s, development of the [[jet engine]] began in Germany and in Britain \u2013 both countries would go on to develop jet aircraft by the end of World War II.\n\n== World War II (1939\u20131945) ==\n{{main|Aviation in World War II}}\n{{See also|Air warfare of World War II|List of aircraft of World War II|List of helicopters used in World War II|World War II aircraft production}}\n[[World War II]] saw a great increase in the pace of development and production, not only of aircraft but also the associated flight-based weapon delivery systems. Air combat tactics and doctrines took advantage. Large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaigns were launched, [[Fighter aircraft#World War II|fighter escorts]] introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks on small targets with [[dive bomber]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, and [[ground-attack aircraft]]. New technologies like [[radar]] also allowed more coordinated and controlled deployment of air defense.\n\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwable.jpg|right|thumb|[[Me 262]], world first operational jet fighter]]\n\nThe first jet aircraft to fly was the [[Heinkel He 178]] (Germany), flown by [[Erich Warsitz]] in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the [[Me 262]], in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the [[Arado Ar 234]], in June 1943. British developments, like the [[Gloster Meteor]], followed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise missile ([[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]), the first ballistic missile ([[V-2 rocket|V-2]]), the first (and to date only) operational rocket-powered combat aircraft [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Me 163]]\u2014with attained velocities of up to {{convert|1130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in test flights\u2014and the first vertical take-off manned point-defense interceptor, the [[Bachem Ba 349]] ''Natter'', were also [[Vergeltungswaffe|developed by Germany]]. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to their late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the declining war industry of Germany.\n\nNot only airplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second World War, with the introduction of the [[Focke Achgelis Fa 223]], the [[Flettner Fl 282]] [[synchropter]] in 1941 in Germany and the [[Sikorsky R-4]] in 1942 in the USA.\n\n== Postwar era (1945\u20131979) ==\n[[File:DeHavilland Comet.jpg|thumb|right|[[de Havilland Comet|D.H. Comet]], the world's first jet airliner. As in this picture, it also saw [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] service]]\n[[File:First flights in aviation history.ogg|thumb|A 1945 newsreel covering various firsts in human flight]]\n{{Main|Postwar aviation}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[commercial aviation]] grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes like the B-29 and [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] that could be converted into commercial aircraft.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[DC-3]] also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British [[de Havilland Comet]]. By 1952, the British state airline [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. The fatigue was caused by cycles of pressurization and depressurization of the cabin and eventually led to catastrophic failure of the plane's fuselage. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already taken to the skies.\n\nUSSR's [[Aeroflot]] became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]]. The [[Boeing 707]] and [[DC-8]] which established new levels of comfort, safety and passenger expectations, ushered in the age of mass commercial air travel, dubbed the [[Jet Age]].\n\nIn October 1947, [[Chuck Yeager]] took the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]] through the [[sound barrier]]. Although anecdotal evidence exists that some fighter pilots may have done so while dive-bombing ground targets during the war,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} this was the first controlled, level flight to exceed the speed of sound. Further barriers of distance fell in 1948 and 1952 with the first jet crossing of the Atlantic and the first nonstop flight to Australia.\n\nThe 1945 invention of [[nuclear bomb]]s briefly increased the strategic importance of military aircraft in the [[Cold War]] between East and West. Even a moderate fleet of long-range [[bomber]]s could deliver a deadly blow to the enemy, so great efforts were made to develop countermeasures. At first, the [[supersonic]] [[interceptor aircraft]] were produced in considerable numbers. By 1955, most development efforts shifted to guided [[surface-to-air missile]]s. However, the approach diametrically changed when a new type of nuclear-carrying platform appeared that could not be stopped in any feasible way: [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. The possibility of these was demonstrated in 1957 with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. This action started the [[Space Race]] between the nations.\n\nIn 1961, the sky was no longer the limit for manned flight, as [[Yuri Gagarin]] orbited once around the planet within 108 minutes, and then used the descent module of [[Vostok 1|Vostok I]] to safely [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter]] the atmosphere and reduce speed from [[Mach number|Mach]] 25 using friction and converting the kinetic energy of the velocity into heat. The United States responded by launching [[Alan Shepard]] into space on a suborbital flight in a [[Mercury program|Mercury]] space capsule. With the launch of the [[Alouette I]] in 1963, Canada became the third country to send a satellite into space. The space race between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] would ultimately lead to the [[Apollo 11|landing]] of men on the moon in 1969.\n\nIn 1967, the [[X-15]] set the air speed record for an aircraft at {{Convert|4534|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} or [[Mach number|Mach]] 6.1. Aside from vehicles designed to fly in outer space, this record was renewed by [[NASA X-43|X-43]] in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 Launch - GPN-2000-000630.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Apollo 11]] lifts off on its mission to land a man on the moon]]\nThe [[Harrier Jump Jet]], often referred to as just \"Harrier\" or \"the Jump Jet\", is a British designed military jet aircraft capable of Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL) via thrust vectoring. It first flew in 1969, the same year that [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] set foot on the moon, and Boeing unveiled the [[Boeing 747]] and the A\u00e9rospatiale-BAC [[Concorde]] supersonic passenger airliner had its [[maiden flight]]. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly, and still carries millions of passengers each year, though it has been superseded by the [[Airbus A380]], which is capable of carrying up to 853 passengers. In 1975, Aeroflot started regular service on the [[Tu-144]]\u2014the first supersonic passenger plane. In 1976, [[British Airways]] and [[Air France]] began supersonic service across the Atlantic, with Concorde. A few years earlier the [[SR-71]] Blackbird had set the record for crossing the Atlantic in under 2 hours, and Concorde followed in its footsteps.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Gossamer Albatross]] became the first human-powered aircraft to cross the English channel. This achievement finally saw the realization of centuries of dreams of human flight.\n\n== Digital age (1980\u2013present) ==\n{{Main|Aviation in the digital age}}\n\n[[File:concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde, ''G-BOAB'', in storage at [[London Heathrow Airport]] following the end of all Concorde flying. This aircraft flew for 22,296 hours between its first flight in 1976 and final flight in 2000.]]\n\nThe last quarter of the 20th century saw a change of emphasis.  No longer was revolutionary progress made in flight speeds, distances and materials technology.  This part of the century instead saw the spreading of the digital revolution both in flight [[avionics]] and in aircraft design and manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn 1986 [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] flew an aircraft, the [[Rutan Voyager]], around the world unrefuelled, and without landing. In 1999 [[Bertrand Piccard]] became the first person to circle the earth in a balloon.\n\nDigital [[fly-by-wire]] systems allow an aircraft to be designed with [[relaxed static stability]]. Initially used to increase the manoeuvrability of military aircraft such as the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], this is now being used to reduce drag on commercial airliners.\n\nThe ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'' was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight.<ref>\n{{Citation | url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/2004NtlPlan/sec1.htm | title = Executive Summary | publisher = U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060924020739/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/2004NtlPlan/sec1.htm | archivedate = 24 September 2006 }}\n</ref> It publicized and encouraged a number of programs, projects and events intended to educate people about the history of aviation.\n\n==21st century==\n21st century aviation has seen increasing interest in fuel savings and fuel diversification, as well as [[low cost airlines]] and [[low cost carrier terminal|facilities]].  Additionally, much of the developing world that did not have good access to air transport has been steadily adding aircraft and facilities, though severe congestion remains a problem in many up and coming nations.

In April 2001 the unmanned aircraft [[Global Hawk]] flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003, the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. UAVs are now an established feature of modern warfare, carrying out pinpoint attacks under the control of a remote operator.\n\nMajor disruptions to [[air travel]] in the 21st century included the [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks|closing of U.S. airspace]] due to the [[September 11 attacks]], and the closing of most of European airspace after the [[2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull]].\n\nIn 2015, Andr\u00e9 Borschberg and [[Solar Impulse|Bertrand Piccard]] flew a record distance of {{convert|4481|mi|km}} from Nagoya, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii in a solar-powered plane, [[Solar Impulse|Solar Impulse 2]].

The modern [[aeroplane]] with its characteristic tail was established by 1909 and from then on the history of the aeroplane became tied to the development of more and more powerful engines.\n\nThe first great ships of the air were the rigid dirigible balloons pioneered by [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], which soon became synonymous with [[airship]]s and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large [[flying boat]]s became popular. After [[World War II]], the flying boats were in their turn replaced by land planes, and the new and immensely powerful [[jet engine]] revolutionised both air travel and [[military aviation]].\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century the advent of digital electronics produced great advances in flight instrumentation and \"fly-by-wire\" systems. The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless drones for military, civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings became possible.\n\n==Primitive beginnings==\n{{Main|Early flying machines}}\n\n===Tower jumping===\n[[File:Daedalus und Ikarus MK1888.png|thumb|[[Daedalus]] working on [[Icarus]]' wings.]]\nSince antiquity there have been stories of men strapping birdlike wings, stiffened cloaks or other devices to themselves and attempting to fly, typically by jumping off a tower. The Greek legend of [[Daedalus and Icarus#Daedalus and Icarus|Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]] is one of the earliest known; others originated from India, China and the European Middle Age.

A sky lantern consists of a paper balloon under or just inside which a small lamp is placed. Sky lanterns are traditionally launched for pleasure and during festivals. According to [[Joseph Needham]], such lanterns were known in China from the 3rd century BC. Their military use is attributed to the general [[Zhuge Liang]] (180\u2013234 AD, honorific title ''Kongming''), who is said to have used them to scare the enemy troops.{{sfn|Deng|Wang|2005|p=113}}\n\nThere is evidence that the Chinese also \"solved the problem of aerial navigation\" using balloons, hundreds of years before the 18th century.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=6}}\n\n=== Renaissance ===\n{{See also|Early flying machines#The Renaissance}}\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|One of Leonardo's sketches]]\n\nEventually, after [[Ibn Firnas]]'s construction, some investigators began to discover and define some of the basics of rational aircraft design.

While theoretically sound, his design was not feasible: the pressure of the surrounding air would crush the spheres.  The idea of using a vacuum to produce lift is now known as [[vacuum airship]] but remains unfeasible with any current [[materials science|materials]].\n \nIn 1709, [[Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o]] presented a petition to King [[John V of Portugal]], begging for support for his invention of an airship, in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The public test of the machine, which was set for 24 June 1709, did not take place. According to contemporary reports, however, Gusm\u00e3o appears to have made several less ambitious experiments with this machine, descending from eminences. It is certain that Gusm\u00e3o was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before the Court on 8 August 1709, in the hall of the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]] in [[Lisbon]], when he propelled a ball to the roof by combustion.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\n=== Balloons ===\n{{Main|History of ballooning}}\n {{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 340 | footer = Lithographic depiction of pioneering events (1783 to 1846). | image1 = Early flight 02562u.jpg | image2 = Early flight 02561u.jpg }}\n\n1783 was a watershed year for ballooning and aviation. Between 4 June and 1 December, five aviation firsts were achieved in France:\n* On 4 June, the [[Montgolfier brothers]] demonstrated their unmanned [[hot air balloon]] at [[Annonay]], France.\n* On 27 August, [[Jacques Charles]] and the [[Robert brothers]] (''[[Robert brothers|Les Freres Robert]]'') launched the world's first unmanned hydrogen-filled balloon, from the [[Champ de Mars]], Paris.\n* On 19 October, the Montgolfiers launched the first manned flight, a tethered balloon with humans on board, at the ''[[Folie Titon]]'' in Paris. The aviators were the scientist [[Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier]], the manufacture manager [[Jean-Baptiste R\u00e9veillon]], and Giroud de Villette.\n* On 21 November, the Montgolfiers launched the first free flight with human passengers. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier, along with the [[Fran\u00e7ois Laurent d'Arlandes|Marquis Fran\u00e7ois d'Arlandes]], successfully petitioned for the honor. They drifted {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a balloon-powered by a wood fire.\n* On 1 December, Jacques Charles and the [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]] launched their manned hydrogen balloon from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] in Paris, as a crowd of 400,000 witnessed. They ascended to a height of about {{convert|1,800|ft|m}}[15] and landed at sunset in [[Nesles-la-Vall\u00e9e]] after a flight of 2 hours and 5 minutes, covering 36&nbsp;km. After Robert alighted Charles decided to ascend alone. This time he ascended rapidly to an altitude of about {{convert|9,800|ft|m}}, where he saw the sun again, suffered extreme pain in his ears, and never flew again.\n\nBallooning became a major \"rage\" in Europe in the late 18th century, providing the first detailed understanding of the relationship between altitude and the atmosphere.\n\nNon-steerable balloons were employed during the [[American Civil War]] by the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]]. The young [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin#Army career|Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] first flew as a balloon passenger with the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] in 1863.\n\nIn the early 1900s, ballooning was a popular sport in Britain. These privately owned balloons usually used [[coal gas]] as the lifting gas. This has half the lifting power of hydrogen so the balloons had to be larger, however, coal gas was far more readily available and the local gas works sometimes provided a special lightweight formula for ballooning events.<ref>Walker (1971) Volume I, Page 195.</ref>\n\n=== Airships ===\n{{Main|Airship|Zeppelin}}\n\n[[File:Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution (1901) - Flickr 18436256195.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Santos-Dumont's \"Number 6\" rounding the Eiffel Tower in the process of winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe Prize, October 1901.]]\nAirships were originally called \"dirigible balloons\" and are still sometimes called dirigibles today.\n\nWork on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when [[Henri Giffard]] flew {{convert|15|mi|km}} in France, with a steam engine driven craft.\n\nAnother advance was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, ''[[La France (airship)|La France]]'', by [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Krebs]]. The {{Convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{Convert|66000|cuft|m3|adj=on}} airship covered {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8\u00bd horsepower electric motor.\n\nHowever, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail. Routine, controlled flights would not occur until the advent of the internal combustion engine (see below.)\n\nThe first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were [[non-rigid airship]]s (sometimes called \"blimps\".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this type of aircraft was the Brazilian [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] who effectively combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he flew his airship ''Number 6'' over Paris from the [[Parc de Saint Cloud]] around the [[Eiffel Tower]] and back in under 30 minutes to win the [[Deutsch de la Meurthe prize]]. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.\n\nAt the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success, the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These would be far more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo carrying capacity for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]].\n\nConstruction of the first [[Zeppelin]] airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, [[Friedrichshafen]]. This was intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned with the wind. The prototype airship ''[[Zeppelin LZ1|LZ 1]]'' (LZ for \"Luftschiff Zeppelin\") had a length of {{convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on}} was driven by two {{convert|10.6|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]] engines and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.\n\nIts first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent flights, bettering the 6&nbsp;m/s speed attained by the French airship ''La France'' by 3&nbsp;m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It would be several years before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.\n\nAlthough airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by heavier-than-air craft.\n\n==Heavier than air==\n{{main|Early flying machines}}\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nItalian inventor [[Tito Livio Burattini]], invited by the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] to his court in [[Warsaw]], built a model aircraft with four fixed [[Glider aircraft|glider]] wings in 1647.<ref>{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|title=[[Science and Civilisation in China]]|volume=IV (part 2)|year=1965|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGyrCfYs2AC&pg=PA591 591]|isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}</ref>  Described as \"four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'\", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.<ref name=\"harrison27\">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=James Pinckney|year=2000|title=Mastering the Sky|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JwJsr5QjkRMC&pg=PA27 27]|isbn=978-1-885119-68-1}}</ref> He promised that \"only the most minor injuries\" would result from landing the craft.<ref name=\"oconner-1985\">Qtd. in {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/books/in-short-nonfiction-man-was-meant-to-fly-but-not-at-first.html|title=In Short: Nonfiction; Man Was Meant to Fly, But Not at First|last=O'Conner|first=Patricia T.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 November 1985|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> His \"Dragon Volant\" is considered \"the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century\".<ref>[\"Burattini's Flying Dragon\", FLIGHT International, 9 May 1963 | {{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200722.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819221108/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200722.html |archivedate=19 August 2016}}]</ref>\n\nThe first published paper on aviation was [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)|\"Sketch of a Machine for Flying in the Air\"]] by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] published in 1716. This flying machine consisted of a light frame covered with strong canvas and provided with two large oars or wings moving on a horizontal axis, arranged so that the upstroke met with no resistance while the downstroke provided lifting power. Swedenborg knew that the machine would not fly, but suggested it as a start and was confident that the problem would be solved. He wrote: \"It seems easier to talk of such a machine than to put it into actuality, for it requires greater force and less weight than exists in a human body. The science of mechanics might perhaps suggest a means, namely, a strong spiral spring. If these advantages and requisites are observed, perhaps in time to come someone might know how better to utilize our sketch and cause some addition to be made so as to accomplish that which we can only suggest. Yet there are sufficient proofs and examples from nature that such flights can take place without danger, although when the first trials are made you may have to pay for the experience, and not mind an arm or leg\". Swedenborg would prove prescient in his observation that a method of powering of an aircraft was one of the critical problems to be overcome.\n\nOn 16 May 1793, the Spanish inventor [[Diego Mar\u00edn Aguilera]] managed to cross the river Arandilla in [[Coru\u00f1a del Conde]], [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]], flying 300 \u2013 400 m, with a flying machine.<ref name=\"aiaa\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=370 |title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics \u2013 History \u2013 Spain |publisher=Aiaa.org |date=22 April 2019 |access-date=22 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110054948/https://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=370 |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nBalloon jumping replaced tower jumping, also demonstrating with typically fatal results that man-power and flapping wings were useless in achieving flight.

Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly. It is preserved in the [[Musee de l'Air]], France, and is claimed to be the earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.\n\nThe Englishman [[Horatio Phillips]] made key contributions to aerodynamics. He conducted extensive wind tunnel research on [[aerofoil]] sections, proving the principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings underpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883\u20131886, the American [[John Joseph Montgomery]] developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting his own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift.\n\n[[File:More otho flying.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Otto Lilienthal]], 29 May 1895.]]\n[[Otto Lilienthal]] became known as the \"Glider King\" or \"Flying Man\" of Germany. He duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his research in 1889 as ''Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation'' (''Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst''). He also produced a series of [[hang glider]]s, including bat-wing, monoplane and biplane forms, such as the [[Derwitzer Glider]] and [[Normal soaring apparatus]]. Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air machine, stimulating interest around the world. He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000 glides until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider crash.\n\nPicking up where Lilienthal left off, [[Octave Chanute]] took up aircraft design after an early retirement, and funded the development of several gliders. In the summer of 1896, his team flew several of their designs eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented and photographed his work.\n\nIn Britain [[Percy Pilcher]], who had worked for Maxim, built and successfully flew several [[Glider aircraft|gliders]] during the mid to late 1890s.\n\nThe invention of the [[box kite]] during this period by the Australian [[Lawrence Hargrave]] would lead to the development of the practical [[biplane]]. In 1894, Hargrave linked four of his kites together, added a sling seat, and was the first to obtain lift with a heavier than air aircraft, when he flew up {{convert|16|ft|m}}. Later pioneers of manned kite flying included [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] in England and Captain G\u00e9nie Saconney in France.\n\n=== Langley ===\n{{Main|Samuel Pierpont Langley}}\n[[File:Samuel Pierpont Langley - Potomac experiment 1903.jpeg|thumb|right|First failure of Langley's manned ''Aerodrome'' on the [[Potomac River]], 7 October 1903]]\n\nAfter a distinguished career in [[astronomy]] and shortly before becoming Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] started a serious investigation into aerodynamics at what is today the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

On both occasions, the ''Aerodrome No. 5'' landed in the water as planned, because, in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On 28 November 1896, another successful flight was made with the ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;6''. This flight, of {{Convert|1460|m|ft}}, was witnessed and photographed by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;6'' was actually ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;4'' greatly modified. So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation.\n\nWith the successes of the ''Aerodrome No.&nbsp;5'' and ''No.&nbsp;6'', Langley started looking for funding to build a full-scale man-carrying version of his designs. Spurred by the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the U.S. government granted him $50,000 to develop a man-carrying flying machine for aerial reconnaissance. Langley planned on building a scaled-up version known as the '''Aerodrome&nbsp;A''', and started with the smaller '''Quarter-scale Aerodrome''', which flew twice on 18 June 1901, and then again with a newer and more powerful engine in 1903.\n\nWith the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to the problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one, but was disappointed when it delivered only {{convert|8|hp|kW|abbr=on}} instead of {{convert|12|hp|kW|abbr=on}} he expected. Langley's assistant, [[Charles M. Manly]], then reworked the design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered {{convert|52|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 950&nbsp;rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with both power and a design, Langley put the two together with great hopes.\n\nTo his dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. Simply scaling up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the ''Aerodrome'' immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time. Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the ''Aerodrome''{{'}}s aerial stability was marginal.<ref name=Anderson2004 />\n\nLangley's attempts to gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine days after his second abortive launch on 8 December, the [[Wright brothers]] successfully flew their ''Flyer''. [[Glenn Curtiss]] made 93 modifications to the ''Aerodrome'' and flew this very different aircraft in 1914.<ref name=Anderson2004 /> Without acknowledging the modifications, the Smithsonian Institution asserted that Langley's ''Aerodrome'' was the first machine \"capable of flight\".<ref>Hallion (2003) pages 294\u2013295.</ref>\n\n===Whitehead===\n{{Main|Gustave Whitehead}}\n[[File:Plane rear w crew.jpg|thumb|right|The No. 21 monoplane seen from the rear.

From 1897 to 1915, he designed and built early flying machines and engines. On 14 August 1901, two and a half years before the Wright Brothers' flight, he claimed to have carried out a controlled, powered flight in his [[Whitehead No. 21|Number 21 monoplane]] at [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], Connecticut. The flight was reported in the ''Bridgeport Sunday Herald'' local newspaper. About 30 years later, several people questioned by a researcher claimed to have seen that or other Whitehead flights.\n\nIn March 2013, ''[[Jane's All the World's Aircraft]]'', an authoritative source for contemporary aviation, published an editorial which accepted Whitehead's flight as the first manned, powered, controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft.<ref>Paul Jackson; [http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065976994 ''Executive Overview: Jane's All the World's Aircraft: Development & Production \u2013 'Justice delayed is justice denied' ''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313075911/http://www.janes.com/products/janes/defence-security-report.aspx?ID=1065976994 |date=13 March 2013 }} (2013)</ref> The [[Smithsonian Institution]] (custodians of the original [[Wright Flyer]]) and many aviation historians continue to maintain that Whitehead did not fly as suggested.<ref>Budd Davisson; [http://www.flightjournal.com/blog/2013/03/25/who-was-first-the-wrights-or-whitehead/ ''Who Was First?

The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their 19th-century predecessors. Their first glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own [[wind tunnel]] and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested.<ref name=Dodson>{{Citation |author=Dodson, MG |title=An Historical and Applied Aerodynamic Study of the Wright Brothers' Wind Tunnel Test Program and Application to Successful Manned Flight |journal=[[United States Naval Academy|US Naval Academy]] Technical Report |volume=USNA-334 |year=2005 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3585 |accessdate=11 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905162319/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3585 |archive-date=5 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher [[aspect ratio]] and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models. By using a rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft, the [[Wright Flyer]], but also helped advance the science of aeronautical engineering.\n\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Wright Flyer]]: the first sustained flight with a powered, controlled aircraft.]]\nThe Wrights appear to be the first to make serious studied attempts to simultaneously solve the power and control problems. Both problems proved difficult, but they never lost interest. They solved the control problem by inventing [[wing warping]] for [[Roll (flight)|roll]] control, combined with simultaneous [[Yaw axis|yaw]] control with a steerable rear rudder. Almost as an afterthought, they designed and built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind. Performance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design because the [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] could not be highly loaded; [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] wings were less affected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability.\n\nAccording to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] (FAI),<ref>[http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/ Smithsonian Institution, \"The Wright Brothers & The Invention of the Aerial Age\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502100132/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/ |date=2 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/000295.asp \"100 Years Ago, the Dream of Icarus Became Reality.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113080326/http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/000295.asp |date=13 January 2011 }} ''FAI NEWS'', 17 December 2003.

In May 1904 they introduced the [[Wright Flyer II|Flyer II]], a heavier and improved version of the original Flyer. On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the [[Wright Flyer III|Flyer III]]. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] and rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two fixed vertical vanes (called \"blinkers\") between the elevators and gave the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device), flying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to the starting point safely and landing without damage.

The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya during the [[Italian-Turkish war]] (September 1911 \u2013 October 1912). The first mission (a reconnaissance) occurred on 23 October 1911.

Its airplanes attacked and reconnoitered the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] positions during the [[First Balkan War|First Balkan War 1912\u201313]]. The first war to see major use of airplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was [[World War I]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] both used airplanes and airships extensively.\n\nWhile the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I,<ref>with the exception of Cl\u00e9ment Ader, who had visionary views about this: \"L'affaire de l'aviation militaire\" (Military aviation concern), 1898 and \"La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l'aviation militaire en France\" (The first step of military aviation en France), 1906</ref> the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached to their [[reconnaissance]] departments. [[Radiotelephone]]s were also being explored on airplanes, notably the [[SCR-68 Airplane Radio Telephone|SCR-68]], as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important.\n\n==World War I (1914\u20131918)==\n{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}\n[[File:GermanFightingMonoplane1917.jpg|thumb|upright|German [[Etrich Taube|Taube]] [[monoplane]], illustration from 1917]]\n\n=== Combat schemes ===\n{{See also|Flying ace|List of World War I flying aces|Aerial victory standards of World War I}}\n\nIt was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this problem when, in late 1914, [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane, but while [[Adolphe Pegoud]] would become known as the first \"[[flying ace|ace]]\", getting credit for five victories, before also becoming the first ace to die in action, it was German [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] Leutnant [[Kurt Wintgens]], who, on 1 July 1915, scored the very first aerial victory by a [[Fokker E.I|purpose-built fighter plane]], with a [[synchronization gear|synchronized machine gun]].\n\nAviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most well known is [[Manfred von Richthofen]], better known as the '''Red Baron''', who shot down 80 planes in [[air-to-air combat]] with several different planes, the most celebrated of which was the [[Fokker Dr.I]]. On the Allied side, [[Ren\u00e9 Paul Fonck]] is credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are considered.\n\nFrance, Britain, Germany and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter planes that saw action during the war,<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/statistics.php WWI airplane statistics by nation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035345/http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/statistics.php |date=15 March 2016 }}</ref> with German aviation technologist [[Hugo Junkers]] showing the way to the future  through his [[Junkers J 1|pioneering use of all-metal aircraft]] from late 1915.\n\n==Between the World Wars (1918\u20131939)==\n{{main|Aviation between the World Wars}}\nThe years between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] saw great advancements in aircraft technology. Airplanes evolved from low-powered biplanes made from wood and fabric to sleek, high-powered monoplanes made of aluminum, based primarily on the founding work of [[Hugo Junkers]] during the World War I period and its adoption by American designer [[William Bushnell Stout]] and Soviet designer [[Andrei Tupolev]]. The age of the great rigid airships came and went. The first successful rotorcraft appeared in the form of the [[autogyro]], invented by Spanish engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] and first flown in 1919. In this design, the rotor is not powered but is spun like a windmill by its passage through the air. A separate powerplant is used to propel the aircraft forwards.\n\n[[File:Flagg biplane.jpg|thumb|left|Flagg biplane from 1933.]]\nAfter World War I, experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their skills. Many American pilots became [[barnstorming|barnstormers]], flying into small towns across the country and showing off their flying abilities, as well as taking paying passengers for rides. Eventually, the barnstormers grouped into more organized displays. Air shows sprang up around the country, with air races, acrobatic stunts, and feats of air superiority. The air races drove engine and airframe development\u2014the [[Schneider Trophy]], for example, led to a series of ever faster and sleeker [[monoplane]] designs culminating in the [[Supermarine S.6B]]. With pilots competing for cash prizes, there was an incentive to go faster. [[Amelia Earhart]] was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming/air show circuit. She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as the crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\n[[File:DeHavilland DH50 biplane.jpg|thumb|Qantas De Havilland biplane, c. 1930]]\nOther prizes, for distance and speed records, also drove development forwards. For example, on 14 June 1919, Captain [[Alcock and Brown|John Alcock]] and Lieutenant [[Alcock and Brown|Arthur Brown]] co-piloted a [[Vickers Vimy]] non-stop from St. John's, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] to Clifden, Ireland, winning the \u00a313,000 ($65,000)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nevin |first=David |title=Two Daring Flyers Beat the Atlantic before Lindbergh |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=1993 |page=105}}</ref> [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|Northcliffe prize]]. The first flight across the South Atlantic and the first aerial crossing using astronomical navigation, was made by the naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922, from [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], with only internal means of navigation, in an aircraft specifically fitted for himself with an [[artificial horizon]] for aeronautical use, an invention that revolutionized air navigation at the time (Gago Coutinho invented a type of [[sextant]] incorporating two spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon).<ref name=\"FIDEHAE\">[http://www.incaer.aer.mil.br/opusculo_trav_atlantico_sul.pdf CAMBESES J\u00daNIOR, Manuel, ''A Primeira Travessia A\u00e9rea do Atl\u00e2ntico Sul'', Bras\u00edlia: INCAER, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211206/http://www.incaer.aer.mil.br/opusculo_trav_atlantico_sul.pdf |date=14 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm History of the Sextant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200611/http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm |date=3 March 2016 }} includes a photograph of a Gago Coutinho spirit level attachment.</ref> Five years later [[Charles Lindbergh]] took the [[Orteig Prize]] of $25,000 for the first ''solo'' non-stop crossing of the Atlantic. Months after Lindbergh, Paul Redfern was the first to solo the Caribbean Sea and was last seen flying over Venezuela.\n\nAustralian Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] was the first to fly across the larger Pacific Ocean in the Southern Cross. His crew left Oakland, California to make the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia in three stages. The first (from Oakland to Hawaii) was {{convert|2400|mi|km}}, took 27 hours 25 minutes, and was uneventful. They then flew to Suva, Fiji {{convert|3100|mi|km}} away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the toughest part of the journey as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. They then flew on to Brisbane in 20 hours, where they landed on 9 June 1928 after approximately {{convert|7400|mi|km}} total flight. On arrival, Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 25,000 at Eagle Farm Airport in his hometown of Brisbane. Accompanying him were Australian aviator [[Charles Ulm]] as the relief pilot, and the Americans James Warner and Captain Harry Lyon (who were the radio operator, navigator and engineer). A week after they landed, Kingsford Smith and Ulm recorded a disc for Columbia talking about their trip. With Ulm, Kingsford Smith later continued his journey being the first in 1929 to [[First aerial circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]], crossing the equator twice.\n\nThe first lighter-than-air crossings of the Atlantic were made by airship in July 1919 by His Majesty's Airship [[R34 (airship)|R34]] and crew when they flew from [[East Lothian]], Scotland to [[Long Island]], New York and then back to [[RNAS Pulham|Pulham]], England. By 1929, airship technology had advanced to the point that the first round-the-world flight was completed by the ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' in September and in October, the same aircraft inaugurated the first commercial transatlantic service. However, the age of the rigid airship ended following the destruction by fire of the zeppelin LZ 129 [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] just before landing at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]] on 6 May 1937, killing 35 of the 97 people aboard. Previous spectacular airship accidents, from the ''[[Wingfoot Air Express Crash|Wingfoot Express]]'' disaster (1919) to the loss of the [[R101]] (1930), the [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)|''Akron'']] (1933) and the [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''Macon'']] (1935) had already cast doubt on airship safety, but with the disasters of the U.S. Navy's rigids showing the importance of solely using [[helium]] as the lifting medium; following the destruction of the Hindenburg, the remaining airship making [[international flight]]s, the ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the rigid airship ''[[Graf Zeppelin II]]'', made a number of flights, primarily over Germany, from 1938 to 1939, but was grounded when Germany began [[World War II]]. Both remaining German zeppelins were scrapped in 1940 to supply metal for the German [[Luftwaffe]]; the last American rigid airship, the ''[[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|Los Angeles]]'', which had not flown since 1932, was dismantled in late 1939.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany, which was restricted by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in its development of powered aircraft, developed [[gliding]] as a sport, especially at the [[Wasserkuppe]], during the 1920s. In its various forms, in the 21st century sailplane aviation now has over 400,000 participants.<ref>{{Citation| url = http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership| title = FAI membership summary| accessdate = 24 August 2006| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810060357/http://www.fai.org/gliding/membership| archivedate = 10 August 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/awards/badges/new_badges FAI web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811162150/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/awards/badges/new_badges |date=11 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, [[Jimmy Doolittle#Instrument flight|Jimmy Doolittle]] developed [[Flight instruments|instrument flight]].\n\n1929 also saw the first flight of by far the largest plane ever built until then: the [[Dornier Do X]] with a wingspan of 48 m. On its 70th test flight on 21 October 1929, there were 169 people on board, a record that was not broken for 20 years.\n\nLess than a decade after the development of the first practical rotorcraft of any type with the autogyro, in the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, two aeronautical engineers working at the ''[[TsAGI|Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut]]'', constructed and flew the TsAGI 1-EA single rotor helicopter, which used an open tubing framework, a four-blade main rotor, and twin sets of {{convert|1.8|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter anti-torque rotors; one set of two at the nose and one set of two at the tail. Powered by two M-2 powerplants, up-rated copies of the [[Gnome Monosoupape]] rotary radial engine of World War I, the TsAGI 1-EA [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx565dqF-5M made several successful low altitude flights]. By 14 August 1932, Cheremukhin managed to get the 1-EA up to an unofficial altitude of {{convert|605|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with what is likely to be the first successful single-lift rotor helicopter design ever tested and flown.\n\nOnly five years after the German Dornier Do-X had flown, Tupolev designed the largest aircraft of the 1930s era, the [[Tupolev ANT-20|''Maksim Gorky'']] in the Soviet Union by 1934, as the largest aircraft ever built using the Junkers methods of metal aircraft construction.\n\nIn the 1930s, development of the [[jet engine]] began in Germany and in Britain \u2013 both countries would go on to develop jet aircraft by the end of World War II.\n\n== World War II (1939\u20131945) ==\n{{main|Aviation in World War II}}\n{{See also|Air warfare of World War II|List of aircraft of World War II|List of helicopters used in World War II|World War II aircraft production}}\n[[World War II]] saw a great increase in the pace of development and production, not only of aircraft but also the associated flight-based weapon delivery systems. Air combat tactics and doctrines took advantage. Large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaigns were launched, [[Fighter aircraft#World War II|fighter escorts]] introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks on small targets with [[dive bomber]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, and [[ground-attack aircraft]]. New technologies like [[radar]] also allowed more coordinated and controlled deployment of air defense.\n\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwable.jpg|right|thumb|[[Me 262]], world first operational jet fighter]]\n\nThe first jet aircraft to fly was the [[Heinkel He 178]] (Germany), flown by [[Erich Warsitz]] in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the [[Me 262]], in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the [[Arado Ar 234]], in June 1943. British developments, like the [[Gloster Meteor]], followed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise missile ([[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]), the first ballistic missile ([[V-2 rocket|V-2]]), the first (and to date only) operational rocket-powered combat aircraft [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Me 163]]\u2014with attained velocities of up to {{convert|1130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in test flights\u2014and the first vertical take-off manned point-defense interceptor, the [[Bachem Ba 349]] ''Natter'', were also [[Vergeltungswaffe|developed by Germany]]. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to their late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the declining war industry of Germany.\n\nNot only airplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second World War, with the introduction of the [[Focke Achgelis Fa 223]], the [[Flettner Fl 282]] [[synchropter]] in 1941 in Germany and the [[Sikorsky R-4]] in 1942 in the USA.\n\n== Postwar era (1945\u20131979) ==\n[[File:DeHavilland Comet.jpg|thumb|right|[[de Havilland Comet|D.H. Comet]], the world's first jet airliner. As in this picture, it also saw [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] service]]\n[[File:First flights in aviation history.ogg|thumb|A 1945 newsreel covering various firsts in human flight]]\n{{Main|Postwar aviation}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[commercial aviation]] grew rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes like the B-29 and [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] that could be converted into commercial aircraft.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[DC-3]] also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first commercial jet airliner to fly was the British [[de Havilland Comet]]. By 1952, the British state airline [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] had introduced the Comet into scheduled service. While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. The fatigue was caused by cycles of pressurization and depressurization of the cabin and eventually led to catastrophic failure of the plane's fuselage. By the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already taken to the skies.\n\nUSSR's [[Aeroflot]] became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]]. The [[Boeing 707]] and [[DC-8]] which established new levels of comfort, safety and passenger expectations, ushered in the age of mass commercial air travel, dubbed the [[Jet Age]].\n\nIn October 1947, [[Chuck Yeager]] took the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]] through the [[sound barrier]]. Although anecdotal evidence exists that some fighter pilots may have done so while dive-bombing ground targets during the war,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} this was the first controlled, level flight to exceed the speed of sound. Further barriers of distance fell in 1948 and 1952 with the first jet crossing of the Atlantic and the first nonstop flight to Australia.\n\nThe 1945 invention of [[nuclear bomb]]s briefly increased the strategic importance of military aircraft in the [[Cold War]] between East and West. Even a moderate fleet of long-range [[bomber]]s could deliver a deadly blow to the enemy, so great efforts were made to develop countermeasures. At first, the [[supersonic]] [[interceptor aircraft]] were produced in considerable numbers. By 1955, most development efforts shifted to guided [[surface-to-air missile]]s. However, the approach diametrically changed when a new type of nuclear-carrying platform appeared that could not be stopped in any feasible way: [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. The possibility of these was demonstrated in 1957 with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. This action started the [[Space Race]] between the nations.\n\nIn 1961, the sky was no longer the limit for manned flight, as [[Yuri Gagarin]] orbited once around the planet within 108 minutes, and then used the descent module of [[Vostok 1|Vostok I]] to safely [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter]] the atmosphere and reduce speed from [[Mach number|Mach]] 25 using friction and converting the kinetic energy of the velocity into heat. The United States responded by launching [[Alan Shepard]] into space on a suborbital flight in a [[Mercury program|Mercury]] space capsule. With the launch of the [[Alouette I]] in 1963, Canada became the third country to send a satellite into space. The space race between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] would ultimately lead to the [[Apollo 11|landing]] of men on the moon in 1969.\n\nIn 1967, the [[X-15]] set the air speed record for an aircraft at {{Convert|4534|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} or [[Mach number|Mach]] 6.1. Aside from vehicles designed to fly in outer space, this record was renewed by [[NASA X-43|X-43]] in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 Launch - GPN-2000-000630.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Apollo 11]] lifts off on its mission to land a man on the moon]]\nThe [[Harrier Jump Jet]], often referred to as just \"Harrier\" or \"the Jump Jet\", is a British designed military jet aircraft capable of Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL) via thrust vectoring. It first flew in 1969, the same year that [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] set foot on the moon, and Boeing unveiled the [[Boeing 747]] and the A\u00e9rospatiale-BAC [[Concorde]] supersonic passenger airliner had its [[maiden flight]]. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly, and still carries millions of passengers each year, though it has been superseded by the [[Airbus A380]], which is capable of carrying up to 853 passengers. In 1975, Aeroflot started regular service on the [[Tu-144]]\u2014the first supersonic passenger plane. In 1976, [[British Airways]] and [[Air France]] began supersonic service across the Atlantic, with Concorde. A few years earlier the [[SR-71]] Blackbird had set the record for crossing the Atlantic in under 2 hours, and Concorde followed in its footsteps.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Gossamer Albatross]] became the first human-powered aircraft to cross the English channel. This achievement finally saw the realization of centuries of dreams of human flight.\n\n== Digital age (1980\u2013present) ==\n{{Main|Aviation in the digital age}}\n\n[[File:concorde g-boab in storage arp.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde, ''G-BOAB'', in storage at [[London Heathrow Airport]] following the end of all Concorde flying. This aircraft flew for 22,296 hours between its first flight in 1976 and final flight in 2000.]]\n\nThe last quarter of the 20th century saw a change of emphasis.  No longer was revolutionary progress made in flight speeds, distances and materials technology.  This part of the century instead saw the spreading of the digital revolution both in flight [[avionics]] and in aircraft design and manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn 1986 [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] flew an aircraft, the [[Rutan Voyager]], around the world unrefuelled, and without landing. In 1999 [[Bertrand Piccard]] became the first person to circle the earth in a balloon.\n\nDigital [[fly-by-wire]] systems allow an aircraft to be designed with [[relaxed static stability]]. Initially used to increase the manoeuvrability of military aircraft such as the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], this is now being used to reduce drag on commercial airliners.\n\nThe ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'' was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight.<ref>\n{{Citation | url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/2004NtlPlan/sec1.htm | title = Executive Summary | publisher = U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060924020739/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/2004NtlPlan/sec1.htm | archivedate = 24 September 2006 }}\n</ref> It publicized and encouraged a number of programs, projects and events intended to educate people about the history of aviation.\n\n==21st century==\n21st century aviation has seen increasing interest in fuel savings and fuel diversification, as well as [[low cost airlines]] and [[low cost carrier terminal|facilities]].  Additionally, much of the developing world that did not have good access to air transport has been steadily adding aircraft and facilities, though severe congestion remains a problem in many up and coming nations.

In April 2001 the unmanned aircraft [[Global Hawk]] flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003, the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. UAVs are now an established feature of modern warfare, carrying out pinpoint attacks under the control of a remote operator.\n\nMajor disruptions to [[air travel]] in the 21st century included the [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks|closing of U.S. airspace]] due to the [[September 11 attacks]], and the closing of most of European airspace after the [[2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull]].\n\nIn 2015, Andr\u00e9 Borschberg and [[Solar Impulse|Bertrand Piccard]] flew a record distance of {{convert|4481|mi|km}} from Nagoya, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii in a solar-powered plane, [[Solar Impulse|Solar Impulse 2]].

Three years later, the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military junta]] came to power; Karouzou, whose husband had died just a month earlier, was labelled as a political dissident and banned from accessing material in the museum by the junta-appointed General Director of Antiquities, [[Spyridon Marinatos]].<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Unable to carry out her research - a situation which she described as 'a shameless exclusion from the places of research of unpublished ancient works'<ref name=\":4\" />- she secretly left the country by boat to stay at the German Institute in Rome and then in Munich by invitation from colleagues. On her return, she was accused of being a communist and prohibited from leaving the country again; international outcry over this led to her being allowed to leave again to spend time visiting other exiled Greeks and to work as an invited scholar at the universities of [[University of T\u00fcbingen|T\u00fcbingen]] and [[University of Geneva|Geneva]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nFollowing the fall of the junta in 1974, Karouzou was able to return to Greece and to take up the position of chair of the Greek arm of the 'Lexicon Iconographicarum Mythologicae Classicae' ('Lexicon of the Iconographies of Classical Mythology'), in which she carried out a great deal of collaborative work with international colleagues.<ref name=\":3\" /> She was also made President of the International Congress of Classical Archaeology in 1983.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nKarouzou published twenty books and over 120 articles during the course of her distinguished career, many of which have proven foundational to understandings of the Classical world; she also made significant contributions to public access to archaeology through the publication of guidebooks to the National Archaeological Museum and to archaeological sites.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=National Museum: Illustrated Guide to the Museum|last=Karouzou|first=Semni|publisher=\u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> From 1975-77 she was Vice President of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Archaeological Society at Athens]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> She was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Lyon|Lyon]], [[University of T\u00fcbingen|T\u00fcbingen]], and [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki]] for her scholarship and contributions to the field.<ref name=\":3\" /> Karouzou defined her own research methodology as attempting to reveal 'the invisible meaning of ancient works'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karouzou|first=Semni|date=1945-1947|title=Ai epta thygateres tou Atlantos (The seven daughters of Atlas)|url=|journal=Archaiologiki Ephemeris|volume=|pages=22\u201336|via=quoted in Nikolaidou & Kokkinidou (1998)}}</ref>\n\nKarouzou died in December 1994; in its announcement of her death, the Greek newspaper ''[[To Vima]]'' called her 'the last representative of the generation of great archaeologists'.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, her contributions to Greek archaeology and museology have often been overlooked due to the focus on prominent male archaeologists over the 'invisible service' of Karouzou's museum curation.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n* National Museum: Illustrated Guide to the Museum, \u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, 2000.\n*\u0392\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1 (Experiences and memorials), \u0397\u039f\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 2.2, 1984, pp.&nbsp;1\u201361\n*Nauplion (in Greek: \u03a4\u03bf \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf). \u0395\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, 1979.\n*''The Amasis Painter'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956.\n*''Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum.
