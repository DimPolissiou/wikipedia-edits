The song is most commonly attributed as being lyrically descended from \"I'll Overcome Some Day\", a hymn by [[Charles Albert Tindley]] that was first published in 1900.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bobetsky|first=Victor|date=2014|title=The complex ancestry of \"We Shall Overcome\"|url=|journal=Choral Journal|volume=57|pages=26\u201336}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=33 revolutions per minute|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=2011|isbn=978-0061670152|location=London, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/33revolutionsper00dori/page/33 33]|url=https://archive.org/details/33revolutionsper00dori/page/33}}</ref>\n\nThe modern version of the song was first said to have been sung by tobacco workers led by Lucille Simmons during a 1945 [[cigar workers strike]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In 1947, the song was published under the title \"'''We Will Overcome'''\" in an edition of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' (a publication of [[People's Songs]], an organization of which [[Pete Seeger]] was the director), as a contribution of and with an introduction by [[Zilphia Horton]], then-music director of the [[Highlander Folk School]] of Monteagle, Tennessee (an adult education school that trained union organizers). Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger,<ref name=\"seegar-biography\">{{cite book|last1=Seeger|first1=Pete|title=Where Have All The Flowers Gone \u2013 A Musical Autobiography|date=1997|publisher=Sing Out|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=1881322106}}</ref> who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]] and [[Joe Glazer]], who recorded it in 1950.\n\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when [[Guy Carawan]] stepped in with his and Seeger's version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on [[nonviolent]] civil rights activism. It quickly became the movement's unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as [[Joan Baez]], sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the [[Northern United States|North]] and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. [[copyright]] of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' issue which contained \"We Will Overcome\" expired in 1976, but [[The Richmond Organization]] asserted a copyright on the \"We Shall Overcome\" lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of [[copyfraud|false copyright claims]], a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the \"We Will Overcome\" lyrics that had fallen into the [[public domain]] because of [[copyright renewal|non-renewal]]. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song.\n\n==Origins as a gospel, folk, and labor song==\n\"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a hymn or [[gospel music]] composition by the Reverend [[Charles Albert Tindley]] of [[Philadelphia]] that was first published in 1900.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/NSoG1900/27 |title=New Songs of the Gospel |chapter=I'll Overcome Some Day |first=C. Albert |last=Tindley |publisher=Hall-Mack Co. |location=Philadelphia |year=1900}}</ref> A noted minister of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], Tindley was the author of approximately 50 gospel hymns, of which \"We'll Understand It By and By\" and \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand By Me]]\" are among the best known. The published text bore the epigraph, \"Ye shall overcome if ye faint not\", derived from [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:9: \"And let us not be weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" The first stanza began:\n\n{{poemquote|The world is one great battlefield,\nWith forces all arrayed;\nIf in my heart I do not yield,\nI'll overcome some day.}}\n\nTindley's songs were written in an idiom rooted in [[African-American culture|African American folk traditions]], using pentatonic intervals, with ample space allowed for improvised interpolation, the addition of \"blue\" thirds and sevenths, and frequently featuring short refrains in which the congregation could join.<ref>Horace Clarence Boyer, \"Charles Albert Tindley: Progenitor of Black-American Gospel Music\", ''The Black Perspective in Music'' 11: No. 2 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 103\u2013132.</ref> Tindley's importance, however, was primarily as a lyricist and poet whose words spoke directly to the feelings of his audiences, many of whom had been freed from [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] only 36 years before he first published his songs, and were often impoverished, illiterate, and newly arrived in the North.<ref>Boyer, [1983], p. 113. \"Tindley was a composer for whom the lyrics constituted its major element; while the melody and  were handled with care, these elements were regarded as subservient to the text.\"</ref> \"Even today,\" wrote musicologist Horace Boyer in 1983, \"ministers quote his texts in the midst of their sermons as if they were poems, as indeed they are.\"<ref>Boyer (1983), p. 113.</ref>\n\nA letter printed on the front page of the February 1909, ''United Mine Workers Journal'' states: \"Last year at a strike, we opened every meeting with a prayer, and singing that good old song, 'We Will Overcome'.\" This statement implied that the song was well-known, and it was also the first acknowledgement of such a song having been sung in both a secular context and a mixed-race setting.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/><ref name=\"ars-overcomesuit\">{{cite web|title=Lawyers who won Happy Birthday copyright case sue over \"We Shall Overcome\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/lawyers-who-won-happy-birthday-copyright-case-sue-over-we-shall-overcome/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref><ref>The United Mine Workers was racially integrated from its founding and was notable for having a large black presence, particularly in Alabama and West Virginia. The Alabama branch, whose membership was three quarters black, in particular, met with fierce, racially based resistance during a strike in 1908 and was crushed. See Daniel Letwin, \"Interracial Unionism, Gender, and Social Equality in the Alabama Coalfields, 1878\u20131908\", ''The Journal of Southern History'' LXI: 3 (August 1955): 519\u2013554.</ref>\n\nTindley's \"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was believed to have influenced the structure for \"We Shall Overcome\",<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/> with both the text and the melody having undergone a process of alteration. The tune has been changed so that it now echoes the opening and closing melody of \"No More Auction Block For Me\",<ref>James Fuld tentatively attributes the change to the version by Atron Twigg and Kenneth Morris. See James J. Fuld, ''The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk'' (noted by Wallace and Wallechinsky)1966; New York: Dover, 1995). According to [[Alan Lomax]]'s ''The Folk Songs of North America'', \"No More Auction Block For Me\" originated in [[Canada]] and it was sung by former slaves who fled there after [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Britain abolished slavery in 1833]].</ref> also known from its refrain as \"Many Thousands Gone\".<ref>Eileen Southern, ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'', Second Edition (Norton, 1971): 546-47, 159-60.</ref> This was number 35 in [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]'s collection of Negro Spirituals that appeared in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' of  June 1867, with a comment by Higginson reflecting on how such songs were composed (i.e., whether the work of a single author or through what used to be called \"communal composition\"):\n\n{{quote|Even of this last composition, however, we have only the approximate date and know nothing of the mode of composition. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] says of the ''Scots Songs'', that, no matter who made them, they were soon attributed to the minister of the parish whence they sprang. And I always wondered, about these, whether they had always a conscious and definite origin in some leading mind, or whether they grew by gradual accretion, in an almost unconscious way. On this point I could get no information, though I asked many questions, until at last, one day when I was being rowed across from Beaufort to Ladies' Island, I found myself, with delight, on the actual trail of a song. One of the oarsmen, a brisk young fellow, not a soldier, on being asked for his theory of the matter, dropped out a coy confession. \"Some good spirituals,\" he said, \"are start jess out o' curiosity. I been a-raise a sing, myself, once.\"\n\nMy dream was fulfilled, and I had traced out, not the poem alone, but the poet. I implored him to proceed.\n\n\"Once we boys,\" he said, \"went for to tote some rice, and de nigger-driver, he keep a-callin' on us; and I say, 'O, de ole nigger-driver!' Den another said, 'First thing my mammy told me was, notin' so bad as a nigger-driver.' Den I made a sing, just puttin' a word, and den another word.\"\n\nThen he began singing, and the men, after listening a moment, joined in the chorus as if it were an old acquaintance, though they evidently had never heard it before. I saw how easily a new \"sing\" took root among them.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Atlantic Monthly |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/1867jun/spirit.htm |title=Negro Spirituals |first=Thomas Wentworth |last=Higginson |date=June 1867 |volume=19 |number=116 |pages=685\u2013694}}</ref>}}\n\nCoincidentally, [[Bob Dylan]] claims that he used the very same melodic motif from \"No More Auction Block\" for his composition, \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".<ref>From the sleeve notes to Bob Dylan's \"Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3\" - \"...it was Pete Seeger who first identified Dylan's adaptation of the melody of this song [\"No More Auction Block\"] for the composition of \"Blowin' in the Wind\". Indeed, Dylan himself was to admit the debt in 1978, when he told journalist Marc Rowland: \"Blowin' in the Wind\" has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called \"No More Auction Block\" - that's a spiritual, and \"Blowin' in the Wind sorta follows the same feeling...\"</ref> Thus similarities of melodic and rhythmic patterns imparted cultural and emotional resonance (\"the same feeling\") towards three different, and historically very significant songs.\n\nMusic scholars have also pointed out that the first half of \"We Shall Overcome\" bears a notable resemblance to the famous lay Catholic hymn \"[[O Sanctissima]]\", also known as \"The Sicilian Mariners Hymn\", first published by a London magazine in 1792 and then by an American magazine in 1794 and widely circulated in American hymnals.<ref name=Bobetsky>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dT_xBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA13 |title=We Shall Overcome: Essays on a Great American Song |first=Victor V. |last=Bobetsky |pages=1\u201313 |date=2015 |accessdate=October 18, 2016|isbn=9781442236035 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsMPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA342&lpg=PA386 |title=Drossiana.

To keep up their spirits during the cold, wet winter of 1945\u20131946, one of the strikers, a woman named Lucille Simmons, led a slow \"long meter style\" version of the gospel hymn, \"We'll Overcome (I'll Be All Right)\" to end each day's picketing. Union organizer [[Zilphia Horton]], who was the wife of the co-founder of the [[Highlander Folk School]] (later Highlander Research and Education Center), said she learned it from Simmons. Horton was Highlander's music director during 1935\u20131956, and it became her custom to end group meetings each evening by leading this, her favorite song. During the presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace]], \"We Will Overcome\" was printed in ''Bulletin No. 3'' (September 1948), 8, of [[People's Songs]], with an introduction by Horton saying that she had learned it from the interracial FTA-CIO workers and had found it to be extremely powerful. [[Pete Seeger]], a founding member of People's Songs and its director for three years, learned it from Horton's version in 1947.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32; see also, Robbie Lieberman, ''My Song Is My Weapon: People's Songs, American Communism, and the Politics of Culture, 1930-50'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, [1989] 1995) p.46, p. 185</ref> Seeger writes: \"I changed it to 'We shall'... I think I liked a more open sound; 'We will' has alliteration to it, but 'We shall' opens the mouth wider; the 'i' in 'will' is not an easy vowel to sing well ....\"<ref name=\"seegar-biography\"/> Seeger also added some verses (\"We'll walk hand in hand\" and \"The whole wide world around\").\n\nIn 1950, the CIO's Department of Education and Research released the album, ''Eight New Songs for Labor'', sung by [[Joe Glazer]] (\"Labor's Troubador\"), and the Elm City Four. (Songs on the album were: \"I Ain't No Stranger Now,\" \"Too Old to Work,\" \"That's All,\" \"Humblin' Back,\" \"Shine on Me,\"  \"Great Day,\" \"The Mill Was Made of Marble,\" and \"We Will Overcome\".) During a Southern CIO drive, Glazer taught the song to country singer Texas Bill Strength, who cut a version that was later picked up by 4-Star Records.<ref>Ronald Cohen and Dave Samuelson, ''Songs for Political Action: Folkmusic, Topical Songs And the American Left 1926\u20131953'', book published as part of Bear Family Records 10-CD box set issued in Germany in 1996.</ref>\n\nThe song made its first recorded appearance as \"We Shall Overcome\" (rather than \"We Will Overcome\") in 1952 on a disc recorded by Laura Duncan (soloist) and The Jewish Young Singers (chorus), conducted by [[Robert De Cormier]], co-produced by Ernie Lieberman and [[Irwin Silber]] on Hootenany Records (Hoot 104-A) (Folkways, FN 2513, BCD15720), where it is identified as a Negro Spiritual.\n\n[[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], a folk singer from California who was a member of People's Songs and later [[The Weavers]], picked up Seeger's version. Hamilton's friend and traveling companion, fellow-Californian [[Guy Carawan]], learned the song from Hamilton. Carawan and Hamilton, accompanied by [[Ramblin Jack Elliot]], visited Highlander in the early 1950s where they also would have heard Zilphia Horton sing the song. In 1957, Seeger sang for a Highlander audience that included [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], who remarked on the way to his next stop, in [[Kentucky]], about how much the song had stuck with him. When, in 1959, Guy Carawan succeeded Horton as music director at Highlander, he reintroduced it at the school. It was the young (many of them teenagers) student-activists at Highlander, however, who gave the song the words and rhythms for which it is currently known, when they sang it to keep their spirits up during the frightening police raids on Highlander and their subsequent stays in jail in 1959\u20131960. Because of this, Carawan has been reluctant to claim credit for the song's widespread popularity. In the PBS video ''We Shall Overcome'', [[Julian Bond]] credits Carawan with teaching and singing the song at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], in 1960.

It was the struggle song of the [[Students Federation of India]] SFI, the largest student organisation in the country. The song translated to the regional language [[Malayalam]] by [[N. P. Chandrasekharan]], an activist for SFI. The translation followed the same tune of the original song, as \"''Nammal Vijayikkum''\". Later it was also published in ''[[Student (SFI newspaper)|Student]]'', the monthly of SFI in Malayalam as well as in Sarvadesheeya Ganangal (Mythri Books, Thiruvananthapuram), a translation of international struggle songs.\n\n\"We Shall Overcome\" was a prominent song in the [[Bollywood films of 2010|2010 Bollywood film]] ''[[My Name is Khan]]'', which compared the struggle of [[Muslims]] in modern [[United States|America]] with the struggles of [[African Americans]] in the past. The song was sung in both [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] in the film, which starred [[Kajol]] and [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]].\n\n==Copyright status==\nThe copyright status of \"We Shall Overcome\" was disputed in the late-2010s. A [[copyright registration]] was made for the song in 1960, which is credited as an [[Derivative work|arrangement]] by Zilphia Horton, Guy Carawan, Frank Hamilton, and Pete Seeger, of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\", with no known original author.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/> Horton's heirs, Carawan, Hamilton, and Seeger share the artists' half of the rights, and The Richmond Organization (TRO), which includes Ludlow Music, Essex, Folkways Music, and Hollis Music, holds the publishers' rights, to 50% of the royalty earnings. Seeger explained that he registered the copyright under the advice of TRO, who showed concern that someone else could register it. \"At that time we didn't know Lucille Simmons' name\", Seeger said.<ref>Seeger, 1993, p. 33</ref> Their royalties go to the \"We Shall Overcome\" Fund, administered by Highlander under the trusteeship of the \"writers\". Such funds are purportedly used to give small grants for cultural expression involving African Americans organizing in the U.S. South.<ref>''Highlander Reports'', 2004, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, the We Shall Overcome Foundation (WSOF), led by music producer [[Isaias Gamboa (music producer)|Isaias Gamboa]], sued TRO and Ludlow, seeking to have the copyright status of the song clarified and the return of all royalties collected by the companies from its usage. The WSOF, which was working on a documentary about the song and its history, were denied permission to use the song by TRO-Ludlow. The filing argued that TRO-Ludlow's copyright claims were invalid because the registered copyright had not been renewed as required by [[United States copyright law]] at the time; because of this, the copyright of the 1948 ''People's Songs'' publication containing \"We Will Overcome\" had expired in 1976. Additionally, it was argued that the registered copyrights only covered specific arrangements of the tune and \"obscure alternate verses\", that the registered works \"did not contain original works of authorship, except to the extent of the arrangements themselves\", and that no record of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\" existed in the database of the [[United States Copyright Office]].<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\">{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=David A. |title=Who Owns 'We Shall Overcome'? |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/we-shall-overcome-lawsuit/478068/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe suit acknowledged that Seeger himself had not claimed to be an author of the song, stating of the song in his autobiography, \"No one is certain who changed 'will' to 'shall.' It could have been me with my [[Harvard University|Harvard]] education. But Septima Clarke, a Charleston schoolteacher (who was director of education at Highlander and after the civil rights movement was elected year after year to the Charleston, S.C. Board of Education) always preferred 'shall.' It sings better.\" He also reaffirmed that the decision to copyright the song was a defensive measure, with his publisher apparently warning him that \"if you don't copyright this now, some Hollywood types will have a version out next year like 'Come on Baby, We shall overcome tonight'\". Furthermore, the liner notes of Seeger's compilation album ''If I Had a Hammer: Songs of Hope & Struggle'' contained a summary on the purported history of the song, stating that \"We Shall Overcome\" was \"probably adapted from the 19th-century hymn, 'I'll Be All Right'\", and that \"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a \"possible source\" and may have originally been adapted from \"I'll Be All Right\".<ref name=\"suit-pdf\">{{cite web |title=WE SHALL OVERCOME FOUNDATION, C.A.

The song is most commonly attributed as being lyrically descended from \"I'll Overcome Some Day\", a hymn by [[Charles Albert Tindley]] that was first published in 1900.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bobetsky|first=Victor|date=2014|title=The complex ancestry of \"We Shall Overcome\"|url=|journal=Choral Journal|volume=57|pages=26\u201336}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=33 revolutions per minute|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=2011|isbn=978-0061670152|location=London, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/33revolutionsper00dori/page/33 33]|url=https://archive.org/details/33revolutionsper00dori/page/33}}</ref>\n\nThe modern version of the song was first said to have been sung by tobacco workers led by Lucille Simmons during a 1945 [[cigar workers strike]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In 1947, the song was published under the title \"'''We Will Overcome'''\" in an edition of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' (a publication of [[People's Songs]], an organization of which [[Pete Seeger]] was the director), as a contribution of and with an introduction by [[Zilphia Horton]], then-music director of the [[Highlander Folk School]] of Monteagle, Tennessee (an adult education school that trained union organizers). Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger,<ref name=\"seegar-biography\">{{cite book|last1=Seeger|first1=Pete|title=Where Have All The Flowers Gone \u2013 A Musical Autobiography|date=1997|publisher=Sing Out|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=1881322106}}</ref> who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]] and [[Joe Glazer]], who recorded it in 1950.\n\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when [[Guy Carawan]] stepped in with his and Seeger's version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on [[nonviolent]] civil rights activism. It quickly became the movement's unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as [[Joan Baez]], sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the [[Northern United States|North]] and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. [[copyright]] of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' issue which contained \"We Will Overcome\" expired in 1976, but [[The Richmond Organization]] asserted a copyright on the \"We Shall Overcome\" lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of [[copyfraud|false copyright claims]], a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the \"We Will Overcome\" lyrics that had fallen into the [[public domain]] because of [[copyright renewal|non-renewal]]. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song.\n\n==Origins as a gospel, folk, and labor song==\n\"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a hymn or [[gospel music]] composition by the Reverend [[Charles Albert Tindley]] of [[Philadelphia]] that was first published in 1900.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/NSoG1900/27 |title=New Songs of the Gospel |chapter=I'll Overcome Some Day |first=C. Albert |last=Tindley |publisher=Hall-Mack Co. |location=Philadelphia |year=1900}}</ref> A noted minister of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], Tindley was the author of approximately 50 gospel hymns, of which \"We'll Understand It By and By\" and \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand By Me]]\" are among the best known. The published text bore the epigraph, \"Ye shall overcome if ye faint not\", derived from [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:9: \"And let us not be weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" The first stanza began:\n\n{{poemquote|The world is one great battlefield,\nWith forces all arrayed;\nIf in my heart I do not yield,\nI'll overcome some day.}}\n\nTindley's songs were written in an idiom rooted in [[African-American culture|African American folk traditions]], using pentatonic intervals, with ample space allowed for improvised interpolation, the addition of \"blue\" thirds and sevenths, and frequently featuring short refrains in which the congregation could join.<ref>Horace Clarence Boyer, \"Charles Albert Tindley: Progenitor of Black-American Gospel Music\", ''The Black Perspective in Music'' 11: No. 2 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 103\u2013132.</ref> Tindley's importance, however, was primarily as a lyricist and poet whose words spoke directly to the feelings of his audiences, many of whom had been freed from [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] only 36 years before he first published his songs, and were often impoverished, illiterate, and newly arrived in the North.<ref>Boyer, [1983], p. 113. \"Tindley was a composer for whom the lyrics constituted its major element; while the melody and  were handled with care, these elements were regarded as subservient to the text.\"</ref> \"Even today,\" wrote musicologist Horace Boyer in 1983, \"ministers quote his texts in the midst of their sermons as if they were poems, as indeed they are.\"<ref>Boyer (1983), p. 113.</ref>\n\nA letter printed on the front page of the February 1909, ''United Mine Workers Journal'' states: \"Last year at a strike, we opened every meeting with a prayer, and singing that good old song, 'We Will Overcome'.\" This statement implied that the song was well-known, and it was also the first acknowledgement of such a song having been sung in both a secular context and a mixed-race setting.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/><ref name=\"ars-overcomesuit\">{{cite web|title=Lawyers who won Happy Birthday copyright case sue over \"We Shall Overcome\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/lawyers-who-won-happy-birthday-copyright-case-sue-over-we-shall-overcome/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref><ref>The United Mine Workers was racially integrated from its founding and was notable for having a large black presence, particularly in Alabama and West Virginia. The Alabama branch, whose membership was three quarters black, in particular, met with fierce, racially based resistance during a strike in 1908 and was crushed. See Daniel Letwin, \"Interracial Unionism, Gender, and Social Equality in the Alabama Coalfields, 1878\u20131908\", ''The Journal of Southern History'' LXI: 3 (August 1955): 519\u2013554.</ref>\n\nTindley's \"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was believed to have influenced the structure for \"We Shall Overcome\",<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/> with both the text and the melody having undergone a process of alteration. The tune has been changed so that it now echoes the opening and closing melody of \"No More Auction Block For Me\",<ref>James Fuld tentatively attributes the change to the version by Atron Twigg and Kenneth Morris. See James J. Fuld, ''The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk'' (noted by Wallace and Wallechinsky)1966; New York: Dover, 1995). According to [[Alan Lomax]]'s ''The Folk Songs of North America'', \"No More Auction Block For Me\" originated in [[Canada]] and it was sung by former slaves who fled there after [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Britain abolished slavery in 1833]].</ref> also known from its refrain as \"Many Thousands Gone\".<ref>Eileen Southern, ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'', Second Edition (Norton, 1971): 546-47, 159-60.</ref> This was number 35 in [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]'s collection of Negro Spirituals that appeared in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' of  June 1867, with a comment by Higginson reflecting on how such songs were composed (i.e., whether the work of a single author or through what used to be called \"communal composition\"):\n\n{{quote|Even of this last composition, however, we have only the approximate date and know nothing of the mode of composition. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] says of the ''Scots Songs'', that, no matter who made them, they were soon attributed to the minister of the parish whence they sprang. And I always wondered, about these, whether they had always a conscious and definite origin in some leading mind, or whether they grew by gradual accretion, in an almost unconscious way. On this point I could get no information, though I asked many questions, until at last, one day when I was being rowed across from Beaufort to Ladies' Island, I found myself, with delight, on the actual trail of a song. One of the oarsmen, a brisk young fellow, not a soldier, on being asked for his theory of the matter, dropped out a coy confession. \"Some good spirituals,\" he said, \"are start jess out o' curiosity. I been a-raise a sing, myself, once.\"\n\nMy dream was fulfilled, and I had traced out, not the poem alone, but the poet. I implored him to proceed.\n\n\"Once we boys,\" he said, \"went for to tote some rice, and de nigger-driver, he keep a-callin' on us; and I say, 'O, de ole nigger-driver!' Den another said, 'First thing my mammy told me was, notin' so bad as a nigger-driver.' Den I made a sing, just puttin' a word, and den another word.\"\n\nThen he began singing, and the men, after listening a moment, joined in the chorus as if it were an old acquaintance, though they evidently had never heard it before. I saw how easily a new \"sing\" took root among them.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Atlantic Monthly |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/1867jun/spirit.htm |title=Negro Spirituals |first=Thomas Wentworth |last=Higginson |date=June 1867 |volume=19 |number=116 |pages=685\u2013694}}</ref>}}\n\nCoincidentally, [[Bob Dylan]] claims that he used the very same melodic motif from \"No More Auction Block\" for his composition, \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".<ref>From the sleeve notes to Bob Dylan's \"Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3\" - \"...it was Pete Seeger who first identified Dylan's adaptation of the melody of this song [\"No More Auction Block\"] for the composition of \"Blowin' in the Wind\". Indeed, Dylan himself was to admit the debt in 1978, when he told journalist Marc Rowland: \"Blowin' in the Wind\" has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called \"No More Auction Block\" - that's a spiritual, and \"Blowin' in the Wind sorta follows the same feeling...\"</ref> Thus similarities of melodic and rhythmic patterns imparted cultural and emotional resonance (\"the same feeling\") towards three different, and historically very significant songs.\n\nMusic scholars have also pointed out that the first half of \"We Shall Overcome\" bears a notable resemblance to the famous lay Catholic hymn \"[[O Sanctissima]]\", also known as \"The Sicilian Mariners Hymn\", first published by a London magazine in 1792 and then by an American magazine in 1794 and widely circulated in American hymnals.<ref name=Bobetsky>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dT_xBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA13 |title=We Shall Overcome: Essays on a Great American Song |first=Victor V. |last=Bobetsky |pages=1\u201313 |date=2015 |accessdate=October 18, 2016|isbn=9781442236035 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsMPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA342&lpg=PA386 |title=Drossiana.

To keep up their spirits during the cold, wet winter of 1945\u20131946, one of the strikers, a woman named Lucille Simmons, led a slow \"long meter style\" version of the gospel hymn, \"We'll Overcome (I'll Be All Right)\" to end each day's picketing. Union organizer [[Zilphia Horton]], who was the wife of the co-founder of the [[Highlander Folk School]] (later Highlander Research and Education Center), said she learned it from Simmons. Horton was Highlander's music director during 1935\u20131956, and it became her custom to end group meetings each evening by leading this, her favorite song. During the presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace]], \"We Will Overcome\" was printed in ''Bulletin No. 3'' (September 1948), 8, of [[People's Songs]], with an introduction by Horton saying that she had learned it from the interracial FTA-CIO workers and had found it to be extremely powerful. [[Pete Seeger]], a founding member of People's Songs and its director for three years, learned it from Horton's version in 1947.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32; see also, Robbie Lieberman, ''My Song Is My Weapon: People's Songs, American Communism, and the Politics of Culture, 1930-50'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, [1989] 1995) p.46, p. 185</ref> Seeger writes: \"I changed it to 'We shall'... I think I liked a more open sound; 'We will' has alliteration to it, but 'We shall' opens the mouth wider; the 'i' in 'will' is not an easy vowel to sing well ....\"<ref name=\"seegar-biography\"/> Seeger also added some verses (\"We'll walk hand in hand\" and \"The whole wide world around\").\n\nIn 1950, the CIO's Department of Education and Research released the album, ''Eight New Songs for Labor'', sung by [[Joe Glazer]] (\"Labor's Troubador\"), and the Elm City Four. (Songs on the album were: \"I Ain't No Stranger Now,\" \"Too Old to Work,\" \"That's All,\" \"Humblin' Back,\" \"Shine on Me,\"  \"Great Day,\" \"The Mill Was Made of Marble,\" and \"We Will Overcome\".) During a Southern CIO drive, Glazer taught the song to country singer Texas Bill Strength, who cut a version that was later picked up by 4-Star Records.<ref>Ronald Cohen and Dave Samuelson, ''Songs for Political Action: Folkmusic, Topical Songs And the American Left 1926\u20131953'', book published as part of Bear Family Records 10-CD box set issued in Germany in 1996.</ref>\n\nThe song made its first recorded appearance as \"We Shall Overcome\" (rather than \"We Will Overcome\") in 1952 on a disc recorded by Laura Duncan (soloist) and The Jewish Young Singers (chorus), conducted by [[Robert De Cormier]], co-produced by Ernie Lieberman and [[Irwin Silber]] on Hootenany Records (Hoot 104-A) (Folkways, FN 2513, BCD15720), where it is identified as a Negro Spiritual.\n\n[[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], a folk singer from California who was a member of People's Songs and later [[The Weavers]], picked up Seeger's version. Hamilton's friend and traveling companion, fellow-Californian [[Guy Carawan]], learned the song from Hamilton. Carawan and Hamilton, accompanied by [[Ramblin Jack Elliot]], visited Highlander in the early 1950s where they also would have heard Zilphia Horton sing the song. In 1957, Seeger sang for a Highlander audience that included [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], who remarked on the way to his next stop, in [[Kentucky]], about how much the song had stuck with him. When, in 1959, Guy Carawan succeeded Horton as music director at Highlander, he reintroduced it at the school. It was the young (many of them teenagers) student-activists at Highlander, however, who gave the song the words and rhythms for which it is currently known, when they sang it to keep their spirits up during the frightening police raids on Highlander and their subsequent stays in jail in 1959\u20131960. Because of this, Carawan has been reluctant to claim credit for the song's widespread popularity. In the PBS video ''We Shall Overcome'', [[Julian Bond]] credits Carawan with teaching and singing the song at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], in 1960. From there, it spread orally and became an anthem of [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] African American [[labor union]] and civil rights activism.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32.</ref> Seeger has also publicly, in concert, credited Carawan with the primary role of teaching and popularizing the song within the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n==Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements==\nIn August 1963, 22-year old folksinger [[Joan Baez]], led a crowd of 300,000 in singing \"We Shall Overcome\" at the Lincoln Memorial during [[A.

In his memoir about his years teaching English in [[Czechoslovakia]] after the [[Velvet Revolution]], Mark Allen wrote:\n\n{{quote|In Prague in 1989, during the intense weeks of the Velvet Revolution, hundreds of thousands of people sang this haunting music in unison in Wenceslas Square, both in English and in Czech, with special emphasis on the phrase 'I do believe.'  This song's message of hope gave protesters strength to carry on until the powers-that-be themselves finally gave up hope themselves.\nIn the Prague of 1964, Seeger was stunned to find himself being whistled and booed by crowds of [[Czechs]] when he spoke out against the [[Vietnam War]].

It was a favorite of Bangladeshi Prime Minister [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and it was regularly sung at public events after Bangladesh gained its independence in the early 1970s. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nIn the Indian State of [[Kerala]], the traditional [[Communism|Communist]] stronghold, the song became popular on college campuses during the late 1970s. It was the struggle song of the [[Students Federation of India]] SFI, the largest student organisation in the country. The song translated to the regional language [[Malayalam]] by [[N. P. Chandrasekharan]], an activist for SFI. The translation followed the same tune of the original song, as \"''Nammal Vijayikkum''\". Later it was also published in ''[[Student (SFI newspaper)|Student]]'', the monthly of SFI in Malayalam as well as in Sarvadesheeya Ganangal (Mythri Books, Thiruvananthapuram), a translation of international struggle songs.\n\n\"We Shall Overcome\" was a prominent song in the [[Bollywood films of 2010|2010 Bollywood film]] ''[[My Name is Khan]]'', which compared the struggle of [[Muslims]] in modern [[United States|America]] with the struggles of [[African Americans]] in the past. The song was sung in both [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] in the film, which starred [[Kajol]] and [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]].\n\n==Copyright status==\nThe copyright status of \"We Shall Overcome\" was disputed in the late-2010s. A [[copyright registration]] was made for the song in 1960, which is credited as an [[Derivative work|arrangement]] by Zilphia Horton, Guy Carawan, Frank Hamilton, and Pete Seeger, of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\", with no known original author.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/> Horton's heirs, Carawan, Hamilton, and Seeger share the artists' half of the rights, and The Richmond Organization (TRO), which includes Ludlow Music, Essex, Folkways Music, and Hollis Music, holds the publishers' rights, to 50% of the royalty earnings. Seeger explained that he registered the copyright under the advice of TRO, who showed concern that someone else could register it. \"At that time we didn't know Lucille Simmons' name\", Seeger said.<ref>Seeger, 1993, p. 33</ref> Their royalties go to the \"We Shall Overcome\" Fund, administered by Highlander under the trusteeship of the \"writers\". Such funds are purportedly used to give small grants for cultural expression involving African Americans organizing in the U.S. South.<ref>''Highlander Reports'', 2004, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, the We Shall Overcome Foundation (WSOF), led by music producer [[Isaias Gamboa (music producer)|Isaias Gamboa]], sued TRO and Ludlow, seeking to have the copyright status of the song clarified and the return of all royalties collected by the companies from its usage. The WSOF, which was working on a documentary about the song and its history, were denied permission to use the song by TRO-Ludlow. The filing argued that TRO-Ludlow's copyright claims were invalid because the registered copyright had not been renewed as required by [[United States copyright law]] at the time; because of this, the copyright of the 1948 ''People's Songs'' publication containing \"We Will Overcome\" had expired in 1976. Additionally, it was argued that the registered copyrights only covered specific arrangements of the tune and \"obscure alternate verses\", that the registered works \"did not contain original works of authorship, except to the extent of the arrangements themselves\", and that no record of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\" existed in the database of the [[United States Copyright Office]].<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\">{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=David A. |title=Who Owns 'We Shall Overcome'? |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/we-shall-overcome-lawsuit/478068/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe suit acknowledged that Seeger himself had not claimed to be an author of the song, stating of the song in his autobiography, \"No one is certain who changed 'will' to 'shall.' It could have been me with my [[Harvard University|Harvard]] education. But Septima Clarke, a Charleston schoolteacher (who was director of education at Highlander and after the Civil Rights Movement was elected year after year to the Charleston, S.C. Board of Education) always preferred 'shall.' It sings better.\" He also reaffirmed that the decision to copyright the song was a defensive measure, with his publisher apparently warning him that \"if you don't copyright this now, some Hollywood types will have a version out next year like 'Come on Baby, We shall overcome tonight'\". Furthermore, the liner notes of Seeger's compilation album ''If I Had a Hammer: Songs of Hope & Struggle'' contained a summary on the purported history of the song, stating that \"We Shall Overcome\" was \"probably adapted from the 19th-century hymn, 'I'll Be All Right'\", and that \"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a \"possible source\" and may have originally been adapted from \"I'll Be All Right\".<ref name=\"suit-pdf\">{{cite web |title=WE SHALL OVERCOME FOUNDATION, C.A.

However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531007.stm  On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated], [[BBC]].

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]]\" with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government's own incomes policy likely.<ref name=\"The Heat of the Kitchen\">{{cite book|last=Donoughue|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|title=The Heat of the Kitchen: An Autobiography|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/yE4KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en|page=298|date=2003|isbn=9781842750513}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 56\u201357]</ref>\n\n====Five per cent limit====\nAt a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Onset of severe winter weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, the cold lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the temperature dropped again, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages; even around London local authorities were only able to clear main roads. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded; rail transport difficulties were exacerbated elsewhere in the country by a strike. Tanker drivers had also gone on strike in some areas from 18 December, causing some homeowners to have difficulties keeping their homes heated and limiting petrol supplies. Only three [[English Football League|League]] football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled. Three men drowned after falling through the ice on the [[Hampstead Heath]] pond in London.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975.

Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978.

He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then.

Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Onset of severe winter weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, wintry conditions lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the cold returned, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages; even around London local authorities were only able to clear main roads. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded; rail transport difficulties were exacerbated elsewhere in the country by a strike. Tanker drivers had also gone on strike in some areas from 18 December, causing some homeowners to have difficulties keeping their homes heated and limiting petrol supplies. Only three [[English Football League|League]] football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled. Three men drowned after falling through the ice on the [[Hampstead Heath]] pond in London.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards.

The development team is the Perth Spirit, which has competed in the [[Australian Rugby Championship]] in 2007 and the [[National Rugby Championship]] since 2014.\n\nThere are currently 10 RugbyWA Board Members, President, D G Redpath who was re-elected in March 2012. Dr R J Perry is the current Chairman and Mr Arthur Hill is the current Patron.\n\nThe RugbyWA is a not-for-profit organisation run by its shareholding organisations \u2013 WA clubs and affiliated bodies (juniors, schools, referees, women's and country rugby).

It promotes some reforms in teaching, but, always focused on the construction of classrooms and not on the effective preparation of the teaching profession, since its government the State witnessed the decline of the quality of public education, a process led by the regime to which it was affiliated.\n\nIn her government she received a visit from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom.\n\n== [[Image:Lorbeerkranz.png|40px]]Brazilian Academy of Letters ==\nHe was elected to the [[Academy]] on April 8, 1954, the third member of Chair 22, whose patron is [[Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio]].

He was the son of the last governor of Bahia in the 19th century, Lu\u00eds Viana. He graduated in law in 1929, but exercised the profession of journalist, corresponding to the newspapers in the Bahian capital \" Di\u00e1rio da Bahia \" and \" [[A Tarde]] \".\n\nIn 1934 he entered politics, being elected federal deputy, being removed due to the coup of the Estado Novo, which returned him to journalism. One of the founders of the PSD, he was re-elected to the same post, after the end of the Vargas Era, in 1945, in successive terms until 1966, when he became incompatible to run for the state government - in an election along the lines of the Military Regime, whose installation in the country he had supported - having been, since 1964, Extraordinary Minister for Affairs of the Civil Cabinet of the exception regime.\n\nOn September 3, 1966 he was elected, indirectly, by the Legislative Assembly, taking office the following year.\n\nProfessor of Private International Law and History of Brazil at the Federal University of Bahia. As a historian, he published some books.\n\nHe was a member of the Historical and Geographic Institute of Bahia; the Academia de Letras da Bahia ; meritorious member of the Brazilian Historical and Geographic Institute; corresponding member of the International Academy of Portuguese Culture, the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon and the Portuguese Academy of History.\n\nAfter the period of government, already by the Arena, he was elected to the Senate, where he chaired the Foreign Relations Commission and the Federal Senate itself, in the 1979-80 biennium. He died in 1990, when he was serving his second term as a senator, having also integrated the PDS and PMDB.\n\nLu\u00eds Viana Filho was the only person to integrate all three Constituent Assemblies of the 20th Century (1934, 1946 and 1987\u201388).\n\n== Government of Bahia ==\nAs part of the period known as \" [[Brazilian Miracle]] \", marked by strong industrialization and exacerbated external indebtedness, Lu\u00eds Viana Filho begins the construction of the industrial park in Bahia, in Aratu, revolving around the petrochemical industry (CIA - Centro Industrial de Aratu).\n\nIn the inaugural speech he says his government is based on the trinomial \"Order, Work and Morality\". It promotes some reforms in teaching, but, always focused on the construction of classrooms and not on the effective preparation of the teaching profession, since its government the State witnessed the decline of the quality of public education, a process led by the regime to which it was affiliated.\n\nIn her government she received a visit from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom.\n\n== [[Image:Lorbeerkranz.png|40px]]Brazilian Academy of Letters ==\nHe was elected to the [[Academy]] on April 8, 1954, the third member of Chair 22, whose patron is [[Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio]].

Originally planned as a six-book series, ''The Wheel of Time'' spanned fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan began writing the first volume, ''[[The Eye of the World]]'', in 1984, and it was published in January 1990.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\">{{cite web|author=Peter Ahlstrom |url=http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html |title=Title Pending (\u4eee): Rolling up the Wheel of Time panel |website=Peterahlstrom.blogspot.com |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\nJordan [[Robert Jordan#Illness and death|died in 2007]] while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes.

The series depicts fictional, ancient mythology that references [[Modern history|modern Earth history]], while events in the series prefigure real Earth myths. The series takes place about three thousand years after \"The Breaking of the World\", a global cataclysm that ended the \"Age of Legends\", a highly advanced era. Throughout most of the series, the world's technology and institutions are comparable to those of the [[Renaissance]], but with greater equality for women; some cultures are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]]. Events later in the series prompt advances similar to the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe main setting for the series is the western region or continent of a larger landmass, both unnamed; however, the western region has been called \"The Westlands\" in licensed media, and by author Robert Jordan in interviews. The Westlands contains multiple kingdoms and city-states and is bounded on the east by a mountain range. To the east is a desert, the Aiel Waste, inhabited by the Aiel warrior people, who live in small settlements and whose society is organized into [[clan]]s and warrior societies. Further east is the large and predominantly insular nation of Shara, separated from the Waste by large mountain ranges and other impassable terrain. North of all three regions is the Great Blight, a hostile wilderness inhabited by evil beings. The Westlands are mostly temperate; it and the Aiel Waste are in the world's northern [[Middle latitudes|mid-latitudes]]. Shara extends slightly south of the [[equator]]. Across an ocean west of the Westlands is Seanchan, the name of a landmass and the empire that spans it. Seanchan is narrower from east to west than the other landmass, but extends most of the way between the ice caps from south to north. A large island in the northwest is separated from the Seanchan mainland by a channel. At the beginning of the series, Westlanders are unaware of Seanchan's existence. ''[[The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time]]'' depicts \"The Land of Madmen\", a small continent in the southern hemisphere, far to the south of the Westlands and the Aiel Waste; it is never mentioned in the main series.\n\nThe series takes place at the end of the \"Third Age\" time period; the Age of Legends was preceded by the \"First Age\", which is implied to be modern Earth. The Third Age in the Westlands was marked by two great upheavals. A thousand years after the Breaking, humanity was nearly overrun by creatures from the Blight in the \"Trolloc Wars\". A thousand years after that, High King Artur Hawkwing unified the region, but his death resulted in the \"War of the Hundred Years\" instead of an orderly dynastic succession. The division of the Westlands into nations changed completely after each of the two events. The Old Tongue, a fictional language from the series, is depicted as a now-dead language, spoken only by scholars and certain nobles, though it still plays a role in the plot of the books.\n\n\"The Pattern\" is a manifestation of both the physical world and people's destinies, while \"the Wheel\" represents the passage of time. These concepts apply to a series of [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel worlds]], as well. Some characters observe or visit such other worlds; some of these worlds reflect different courses of history, and some are so divergent from the main reality that they are uninhabited. [[Physics]] sometimes operates differently in these worlds. The Seanchan imported \"exotic\" creatures from other worlds, later breeding and training them. Tel'aran'rhiod is the \"world of dreams\", which connects to all of the other worlds. It can be visited in one's sleep, but events there are real; it is also possible to enter physically.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe prequel novel ''[[New Spring]]'' takes place during the Aiel War and depicts the discovery by certain Aes Sedai that the Dragon has been Reborn.\n\nThe series proper commences almost twenty years later in the [[Andor (Wheel of Time)#Two Rivers|Two Rivers]], a near-forgotten district of the country of [[Andor (Wheel of Time)|Andor]]. An Aes Sedai, [[Moiraine Damodred|Moiraine]], and her Warder [[Lan Mandragoran|Lan]], arrive in the village of Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths ([[Rand al'Thor]], [[Matrim Cauthon]], or [[Perrin Aybara]]) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend [[Egwene al'Vere]]. [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], the village wise-woman, later joins them. [[Itinerant poet|Gleeman]] [[Thom Merrilin]] also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of [[Places in the Wheel of Time series#Tar Valon|Tar Valon]]. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the [[Seanchan]], the descendants of a long-lost colony of [[Artur Hawkwing]]'s empire. The Aes Sedai also become divided on how to deal with the Dragon Reborn.\n\nAs the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced.\n\n===Tarmon Gai'don===\nDeriving its name from that of [[Armageddon]] in Christian eschatology, Tarmon Gai'don is the apocalyptic battle wherein the Dragon Reborn opposes Shai'tan, while their followers fight elsewhere. Events and portents that foreshadow the Last Battle take place in ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]''. The Last Battle takes place in ''[[A Memory of Light]]'', in the form of a 202-page single chapter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-maygers/a-memory-of-light-wheel-of-time_b_2429397.html | title=''A Memory of Light'' Review: Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan Give a Thrilling End to The Wheel of Time | work=The Huffington Post | date=March 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 19, 2016 | author=Bryan Maygers}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Wheel of Time characters}}\n\n==Special powers==\nIn the series, many characters possess special powers. Within the fictional world, some of these abilities are widely known and understood, while others are undocumented; some are depicted as unique. Some characters take the reappearance of ancient abilities as a sign that the Last Battle is coming.\n\n=== Channeling ===\n\"Channeling\" is equivalent to [[Magic in fiction|magic as depicted in other fantasy-genre works]], but is never called \"magic\" in the series. Many characters are channelers, including series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Nynaeve al'Meara, Elayne Trakand, Moiraine Damodred, and Aviendha. Channelers can access a natural power source called the \"One Power\", while Shai'tan can grant access to a separate power, the \"True Power\". Very little is written in the series about the True Power, while the One Power is described extensively. The One Power consists of five elemental \"Powers\": earth, water, air, fire, and spirit. Channelers often have particular strength in at least one Power, more commonly earth and fire in men and water and air in women; strength in spirit is equally rare between the sexes. A channeler creates a \"weave\" to achieve a specific effect by placing individual \"flows\" of the five Powers in a specific geometric configuration. The One Power has two aspects: \"saidin\", used by men; and \"saidar\", used by women. They differ sufficiently that no woman can teach a man to channel (and vice versa), and they can be used in drastically incompatible ways, though they sometimes achieve functionally identical effects. The True Power similarly differs from both. Male channelers are usually stronger than women, but women have advantages at \"linking\" with other channelers to harness more power; an individual's strength is quantified by the amount of the One Power he or she can channel at once. Some men and women are born with the \"spark\" to channel; these individuals will spontaneously begin to channel around puberty, but without formal training three of every four will suffer a fatal illness caused by channeling. Those who survive are called \"wilders\", and often are unaware of the existence or nature of their powers. Channelers are constrained by any restriction they believe applies; wilders often possess a \"block\" that allows them to channel only under specific circumstances (such as experiencing a particular emotion). The majority of channelers lack the spark and will channel only if taught. Channelers can determine if a person of the same sex has the spark or is capable of learning to channel. A channeler with the spark who receives instruction is not at risk of death and is not normally considered a wilder. Channelers have a longer lifespan than non-channelers, in proportion to their strength; from early adulthood, channelers age more slowly than non-channelers, and the strongest channelers can live over 800 years. Shai'tan tainted saidin at the end of the Age of Legends, causing any male channeler to go insane (usually very destructively) and die; the Breaking was caused by the world's male channelers simultaneously going insane, while in the Third Age male channelers are neutralized in various ways as they come of age.\n\nChannelers are treated in different ways by different cultures within the series. In the Westlands, channeling is viewed as synonymous with the Aes Sedai, an organization that survived from the Age of Legends and which views channeling as its proprietary domain; some Aes Sedai refer to channelers from other traditions as \"wilders\", even if they are not self-taught. Aes Sedai are respected in most Westland nations, and they rule the city-state of Tar Valon. Aes Sedai are divided into seven \"ajahs\" named after colors and dedicated to different purposes; Red Ajah members seek out men who can channel and \"gentle\" them (remove their ability to channel). Also in the Westlands are the Kin, consisting of women who studied in Tar Valon but left without becoming Aes Sedai due to lack of desire or ability to complete their training. The Aes Sedai are aware of the Kin, who are very discreet, but are unaware that the Kin actually outnumber them. Among the Sea Folk, a seafaring Westlands culture, female channelers are expected to become \"Windfinders\", ship's navigators; the profession is also open to non-channelers. Every generation, the Sea Folk send a few weak channelers to Tar Valon, successfully concealing the prevalence and strength of their channelers. Aiel channelers are expected to become Wise Ones, the culture's spiritual leaders, as are all Dreamwalkers; other worthy women may become Wise Ones without these special powers. Male Aiel channelers go into the Blight, expecting to die after killing some of Shai'tan's creatures; unbeknownst to the Aiel, Shai'tan actually captures and corrupts these men. Shara is secretly ruled by its female channelers, the Ayyad, through [[figurehead]] monarchs; the Ayyad keep their male offspring as breeding stock before killing them. The Seanchan believe channelers are subhuman and dangerous; they enslave female channelers with the spark, while those capable of acting as their handlers are, unbeknownst to themselves and other Seanchan, those who can learn to channel. Male channelers are executed.\n\nCertain \"objects of the One Power\" exist. \"Angreal\" and \"sa'angreal\" increase the amount of the One Power a channeler can harness; sa'angreal may be [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more powerful than angreal. \"Ter'angreal\" produce specific effects; some require channeling to function, while others operate continuously or via touch; some affect only channelers or affect them differently.\n\n==== Talents ====\nRobert Jordan uses the capitalized word \"Talent\" to refer to two distinct types of abilities sometimes possessed by channelers; the text also sometimes uses \"Talent\" to refer to abilities unrelated to the One Power and possessed by non-channelers.\n\nOne type of Talent is the aptitude for a particular weave or type of weave. Talents seen in the series include healing (Nynaeve al'Meara), manipulating weather (many Windfinders), creating \"gateways\" for instantaneous travel (Androl Genhald), and fabricating the indestructible substance \"cuendillar\" (Egwene al'Vere). Such a Talent may manifest as finer control over weaves, the ability to use a weave that would otherwise be beyond the channeler's strength, superior results when using a weave with all other factors equal, or some combination of these benefits. Some weaves, such as creating cuendillar, function only for a channeler with a corresponding Talent.\n\nA Talent can also be some other ability possessed only by some channelers, but distinct from creating weaves of the One Power. Talents of this type include creating ter'angreal (Elayne Trakand), perceiving the purpose or function of a ter'angreal (Aviendha), analyzing an expended weave, \"unweaving\" a weave (Aviendha), predicting the weather (Nynaeve al'Meara), recognizing ta'veren on sight (Siuan Sanche and Logain Ablar), and \"Foretelling\" prophecy (Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan).  The latter three Talents have no obvious connection to the One Power, but are described as occurring only in channelers.\n\n=== Other abilities ===\nSome abilities depicted in the Wheel of Time are not related to the One Power or the ability to channel.\n\n\"Dreaming\" (an Aes Sedai term) is the ability to have prophetic dreams, which are usually symbolic rather than literal. \"Dreamwalking\" (an Aiel term) is a set of abilities involving dreaming, including the ability to visit Tel'aran'rhiod and the dreams of others at will, and aptitude for manipulating Tel'aran'rhiod.  Egwene al'Vere is both a Dreamer and Dreamwalker, and the text never establishes whether or not these are two separate things. Dreamwalking is well known to the Aiel Wise ones, who use it for society-wide communication; Aiel Dreamwalkers include channelers Amys and Melaine and the non-channeler Bair, who become Egwene's teachers as the last Aes Sedai Dreamer died about five hundred years earlier.  No man is explicitly identified as a Dreamwalker in the series, but many of the male and female Forsaken, Shai'tan's top lieutenants, appear in Tel'aran'rhiod, and the male Forsaken Ishamael projects himself into other characters' dreams.\n\n\"Ta'veren\" are individuals who are focal points of the Pattern for a time.  Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all ta'veren during the events of the series. The Pattern causes events and the actions of others surrounding a ta'veren to conform to the ta'veren's [[destiny]], usually resulting in occurrences that are possible but unlikely.  Mat has exceptionally good luck at gambling and in battle, while Perrin easily earns the support of others.  Rand's presence often affects a large area around himself, causing such anomalies as one entire village pairing off in marriage in one day, another village erupting into violence over every disagreement its residents ever had, and a city's newborns being free of [[birth defect]]s during Rand's residency.\n\nRand al'Thor is also the \"Dragon Reborn,\" a prophesied savior.  Towards the end of the series, Rand is revealed to be a human tree singer a lost art. He is also shown to have reality warping abilities related to the Dragon Reborn's connection to the Pattern; he kindles a pipe without channeling.\n\nPerrin Aybara and Elyas Machera are \"Wolfbrothers,\" individuals who can communicate telepathically with wolves, which are depicted as [[Sapience|sapient]].  Wolfbrothers also have abilities similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking, although they are not shown as capable of entering the dreams of others. The souls of wolves inhabit Tel'aran'rhiod, which they call the \"wolf dream,\" and a Wolfbrother who loses his identity as a man may become a wolf there.  Only male Wolfbrothers are depicted in the series.\n\nMin Farshaw sees [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] and images around people; she does not always understand these visions, but sometimes she instinctively understands them and is always correct in such cases.  Min is the only person in the series depicted as having this ability.  However, the superstitious Seanchan are apparently familiar with it and consider the images to be [[omen]]s; when Empress Fortuona learns that Min possesses this ability, she identifies Min as a \"Doomseer\" and immediately makes her a top advisor.\n\nHurin is a \"sniffer,\" one who can detect violence as an unpleasant odor.  This ability is apparently accepted by his countrymen; it is considered an asset for his career in law enforcement, and Perrin pretends to be a sniffer to conceal that the true source of his insight is communication with wolves.\n\nThe Seanchan produce ter'angreal rings that, when touched with the wearer's blood, grant him or her the abilities of a \"Bloodknife\":  increased strength and speed and the ability to blend into shadows, at the cost of dying within a matter of days or weeks.\n\nThe books describe several scenarios where Shai'tan gives powers to individuals.  People whose souls are removed by Shai'tan become supernaturally inconspicuous \"Gray Men,\" ideal assassins.  Padan Fain serves Shai'tan and is given the ability to track Rand al'Thor. Padan Fain later merges with the ghost of the evil Mordeth, gaining the abilities to inculcate others with paranoia and to summon and control a deadly miasma.  Shai'tan merges the bodies and souls of Isam Mandragoran and Luc Mantear into the individual known as Slayer, to whom Shai'tan grants powers involving Tel'aran'rhiod, including the ability to travel instantaneously between there and the physical world while awake and without the use of a gateway.\n\n== Books in the series ==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall= |title= |airdate=

Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons were Robert Jordan's editorial assistants. The book is an encapsulating glossary of the entire series.\n\n==Development==\n===Writing and conception===\nIn the early 1980s Robert Jordan wrote several [[Conan the Barbarian]] novels for Tor Books, including a [[novelization]] of the movie ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. These proved successful and in 1984 he proposed an idea for an epic fantasy series of three books to Tom Doherty, the head of [[Tor Books]].<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/> Doherty approved the idea; however, knowing that Jordan had a tendency to go long, Doherty put Jordan on contract for six books just in case.  Jordan began writing the novel that became ''The Eye of the World''.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nThe novel proved extremely difficult to write and characters and storylines changed considerably during the writing process. The series was originally centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and made the characters younger and less experienced.<ref name=\"thewertzone\">{{cite web|url=http://thewertzone.blogspot.ca/2018/01/the-genesis-of-wheel-of-time.html |title=The Genesis of the Wheel of Time |last=Whitehead |first=Adam |date=2018-01-07 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}</ref> Once this decision had been made, writing proceeded much more easily and Jordan completed the second volume, ''[[The Great Hunt]]'', at roughly the same time the first book was published.<ref>Foreword dated February 1990, ''The Great Hunt'' by Robert Jordan, published by Tor Books</ref>\n\nTom Doherty enjoyed ''The Eye of the World'' so much that he declared it would be the biggest fantasy series since Tolkien,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}  and took the unprecedented steps of sending free review copies to every bookstore in the United States to generate interest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The combined hardcover and trade paperback run of the novel sold out of its initial 40,000-strong print run. Sales then doubled with the publication of the second novel just eight months later generating more interest in the first book.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nJordan wrote full-time at breakneck speed for the next several years until he completed the seventh volume, ''[[A Crown of Swords]]'', at which point he slowed down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called ''New Spring'', so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes, but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, ''[[Crossroads of Twilight]]'' (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, ''[[Winter's Heart]]'', from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'', the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title ''A Memory of Light'', would conclude the series.\n\n===Author's death and final books===\n{{See also|A Memory of Light|The Gathering Storm (novel)|Towers of Midnight}}\nJordan had stated that the main sequence would conclude with the twelfth book, ''[[A Memory of Light]]''.

It has been in operation almost continuously (there was a significant outage during 2013\u201314) since 1993. Notably, the ''WoTMUD'' had gained written permission from the author to use his creation including all but major characters.\n\nA [[The Wheel of Time (video game)|''Wheel of Time'' computer game]] was released in 1999. Over the course of the game, a lone Aes Sedai must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison. While Robert Jordan was consulted in the creation of the game, he did not write the storyline himself and the game is not considered [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].\n\n''[[The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game]]'' was released in 2001 from [[Wizards of the Coast]] using the [[d20 system|d20]] rules developed for the third edition of the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] game. The game had a single adventure module published in 2002, ''Prophecies of the Dragon''. Shortly after the release of the adventure book Wizards of the Coast announced they would not be releasing any further products for the game. Robert Jordan cited some problems with the roleplaying game, such as storyline details in the adventure module that contradicted the books.\n\nIn early 2009 [[Electronic Arts|EA Games]] announced that they had bought the rights for a MMORPG, with the plan to publish it through the EA Partners-Program.

Originally planned as a six-book series, ''The Wheel of Time'' spanned fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan began writing the first volume, ''[[The Eye of the World]]'', in 1984, and it was published in January 1990.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\">{{cite web|author=Peter Ahlstrom |url=http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html |title=Title Pending (\u4eee): Rolling up the Wheel of Time panel |website=Peterahlstrom.blogspot.com |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\nJordan [[Robert Jordan#Illness and death|died in 2007]] while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes. Fellow fantasy author and long-time ''Wheel of Time'' fan [[Brandon Sanderson]] was brought in to complete the final book, but during the writing process, it was decided that the book would be far too large to be published in one volume and would instead be published as three volumes:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyhPRIokTSM |title=Brandon Sanderson Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref> ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]'' (2009), ''[[Towers of Midnight]]'' (2010), and ''[[A Memory of Light]]'' (2013).\n\nThe series draws on numerous elements of both [[European mythology|European]] and [[Asian mythology]], most notably the cyclical nature of time found in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the metaphysical concepts of [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]], and a respect for nature found in [[Taoism]]. Additionally, its creation story has similarities to [[Christianity]]'s \"Creator\" ([[Let there be light|Light]]) and Shai'tan, \"The Dark One\" ([[Shaitan]] is an Arabic word that, in [[Islam]]ic contexts, is used as a name for the [[Devil]] or the [[Satan]]). It was also partly inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' ([[1869 in literature|1869]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Robert Jordan|work= SFX Magazine |number=16|date= September 1996}}</ref>\n\n''The Wheel of Time'' is notable for its length, detailed [[Fictional universe|imaginary world]], well-developed [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] system, and large [[:Category:Wheel of Time characters|cast of characters]].

The series depicts fictional, ancient mythology that references [[Modern history|modern Earth history]], while events in the series prefigure real Earth myths. The series takes place about three thousand years after \"The Breaking of the World\", a global cataclysm that ended the \"Age of Legends\", a highly advanced era. Throughout most of the series, the world's technology and institutions are comparable to those of the [[Renaissance]], but with greater equality for women; some cultures are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]]. Events later in the series prompt advances similar to the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe main setting for the series is the western region or continent of a larger landmass, both unnamed; however, the western region has been called \"The Westlands\" in licensed media, and by author Robert Jordan in interviews. The Westlands contains multiple kingdoms and city-states and is bounded on the east by a mountain range. To the east is a desert, the Aiel Waste, inhabited by the Aiel warrior people, who live in small settlements and whose society is organized into [[clan]]s and warrior societies. Further east is the large and predominantly insular nation of Shara, separated from the Waste by large mountain ranges and other impassable terrain. North of all three regions is the Great Blight, a hostile wilderness inhabited by evil beings. The Westlands are mostly temperate; it and the Aiel Waste are in the world's northern [[Middle latitudes|mid-latitudes]]. Shara extends slightly south of the [[equator]]. Across an ocean west of the Westlands is Seanchan, the name of a landmass and the empire that spans it. Seanchan is narrower from east to west than the other landmass, but extends most of the way between the ice caps from south to north. A large island in the northwest is separated from the Seanchan mainland by a channel. At the beginning of the series, Westlanders are unaware of Seanchan's existence. ''[[The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time]]'' depicts \"The Land of Madmen\", a small continent in the southern hemisphere, far to the south of the Westlands and the Aiel Waste; it is never mentioned in the main series.\n\nThe series takes place at the end of the \"Third Age\" time period; the Age of Legends was preceded by the \"First Age\", which is implied to be modern Earth. The Third Age in the Westlands was marked by two great upheavals. A thousand years after the Breaking, humanity was nearly overrun by creatures from the Blight in the \"Trolloc Wars\". A thousand years after that, High King Artur Hawkwing unified the region, but his death resulted in the \"War of the Hundred Years\" instead of an orderly dynastic succession. The division of the Westlands into nations changed completely after each of the two events. The Old Tongue, a fictional language from the series, is depicted as a now-dead language, spoken only by scholars and certain nobles, though it still plays a role in the plot of the books.\n\n\"The Pattern\" is a manifestation of both the physical world and people's destinies, while \"the Wheel\" represents the passage of time. These concepts apply to a series of [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel worlds]], as well. Some characters observe or visit such other worlds; some of these worlds reflect different courses of history, and some are so divergent from the main reality that they are uninhabited. [[Physics]] sometimes operates differently in these worlds. The Seanchan imported \"exotic\" creatures from other worlds, later breeding and training them. Tel'aran'rhiod is the \"world of dreams\", which connects to all of the other worlds. It can be visited in one's sleep, but events there are real; it is also possible to enter physically.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe prequel novel ''[[New Spring]]'' takes place during the Aiel War and depicts the discovery by certain Aes Sedai that the Dragon has been Reborn.\n\nThe series proper commences almost twenty years later in the [[Andor (Wheel of Time)#Two Rivers|Two Rivers]], a near-forgotten district of the country of [[Andor (Wheel of Time)|Andor]]. An Aes Sedai, [[Moiraine Damodred|Moiraine]], and her Warder [[Lan Mandragoran|Lan]], arrive in the village of Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths ([[Rand al'Thor]], [[Matrim Cauthon]], or [[Perrin Aybara]]) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend [[Egwene al'Vere]]. [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], the village wise-woman, later joins them. [[Itinerant poet|Gleeman]] [[Thom Merrilin]] also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of [[Places in the Wheel of Time series#Tar Valon|Tar Valon]]. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the [[Seanchan]], the descendants of a long-lost colony of [[Artur Hawkwing]]'s empire. The Aes Sedai also become divided on how to deal with the Dragon Reborn.\n\nAs the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced.\n\n===Tarmon Gai'don===\nDeriving its name from that of [[Armageddon]] in Christian eschatology, Tarmon Gai'don is the apocalyptic battle wherein the Dragon Reborn opposes Shai'tan, while their followers fight elsewhere. Events and portents that foreshadow the Last Battle take place in ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]''. The Last Battle takes place in ''[[A Memory of Light]]'', in the form of a 202-page single chapter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-maygers/a-memory-of-light-wheel-of-time_b_2429397.html | title=''A Memory of Light'' Review: Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan Give a Thrilling End to The Wheel of Time | work=The Huffington Post | date=March 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 19, 2016 | author=Bryan Maygers}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Wheel of Time characters}}\n\n==Special powers==\nIn the series, many characters possess special powers. Within the fictional world, some of these abilities are widely known and understood, while others are undocumented; some are depicted as unique. Some characters take the reappearance of ancient abilities as a sign that the Last Battle is coming.\n\n=== Channeling ===\n\"Channeling\" is equivalent to [[Magic in fiction|magic as depicted in other fantasy-genre works]], but is never called \"magic\" in the series. Many characters are channelers, including series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Nynaeve al'Meara, Elayne Trakand, Moiraine Damodred, and Aviendha. Channelers can access a natural power source called the \"One Power\", while Shai'tan can grant access to a separate power, the \"True Power\". Very little is written in the series about the True Power, while the One Power is described extensively. The One Power consists of five elemental \"Powers\": earth, water, air, fire, and spirit. Channelers often have particular strength in at least one Power, more commonly earth and fire in men and water and air in women; strength in spirit is equally rare between the sexes. A channeler creates a \"weave\" to achieve a specific effect by placing individual \"flows\" of the five Powers in a specific geometric configuration. The One Power has two aspects: \"saidin\", used by men; and \"saidar\", used by women. They differ sufficiently that no woman can teach a man to channel (and vice versa), and they can be used in drastically incompatible ways, though they sometimes achieve functionally identical effects. The True Power similarly differs from both. Male channelers are usually stronger than women, but women have advantages at \"linking\" with other channelers to harness more power; an individual's strength is quantified by the amount of the One Power he or she can channel at once. Some men and women are born with the \"spark\" to channel; these individuals will spontaneously begin to channel around puberty, but without formal training three of every four will suffer a fatal illness caused by channeling. Those who survive are called \"wilders\", and often are unaware of the existence or nature of their powers. Channelers are constrained by any restriction they believe applies; wilders often possess a \"block\" that allows them to channel only under specific circumstances (such as experiencing a particular emotion). The majority of channelers lack the spark and will channel only if taught. Channelers can determine if a person of the same sex has the spark or is capable of learning to channel. A channeler with the spark who receives instruction is not at risk of death and is not normally considered a wilder. Channelers have a longer lifespan than non-channelers, in proportion to their strength; from early adulthood, channelers age more slowly than non-channelers, and the strongest channelers can live over 800 years. Shai'tan tainted saidin at the end of the Age of Legends, causing any male channeler to go insane (usually very destructively) and die; the Breaking was caused by the world's male channelers simultaneously going insane, while in the Third Age male channelers are neutralized in various ways as they come of age.\n\nChannelers are treated in different ways by different cultures within the series. In the Westlands, channeling is viewed as synonymous with the Aes Sedai, an organization that survived from the Age of Legends and which views channeling as its proprietary domain; some Aes Sedai refer to channelers from other traditions as \"wilders\", even if they are not self-taught. Aes Sedai are respected in most Westland nations, and they rule the city-state of Tar Valon. Aes Sedai are divided into seven \"ajahs\" named after colors and dedicated to different purposes; Red Ajah members seek out men who can channel and \"gentle\" them (remove their ability to channel). Also in the Westlands are the Kin, consisting of women who studied in Tar Valon but left without becoming Aes Sedai due to lack of desire or ability to complete their training. The Aes Sedai are aware of the Kin, who are very discreet, but are unaware that the Kin actually outnumber them. Among the Sea Folk, a seafaring Westlands culture, female channelers are expected to become \"Windfinders\", ship's navigators; the profession is also open to non-channelers. Every generation, the Sea Folk send a few weak channelers to Tar Valon, successfully concealing the prevalence and strength of their channelers. Aiel channelers are expected to become Wise Ones, the culture's spiritual leaders, as are all Dreamwalkers; other worthy women may become Wise Ones without these special powers. Male Aiel channelers go into the Blight, expecting to die after killing some of Shai'tan's creatures; unbeknownst to the Aiel, Shai'tan actually captures and corrupts these men. Shara is secretly ruled by its female channelers, the Ayyad, through [[figurehead]] monarchs; the Ayyad keep their male offspring as breeding stock before killing them. The Seanchan believe channelers are subhuman and dangerous; they enslave female channelers with the spark, while those capable of acting as their handlers are, unbeknownst to themselves and other Seanchan, those who can learn to channel. Male channelers are executed.\n\nCertain \"objects of the One Power\" exist. \"Angreal\" and \"sa'angreal\" increase the amount of the One Power a channeler can harness; sa'angreal may be [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more powerful than angreal. \"Ter'angreal\" produce specific effects; some require channeling to function, while others operate continuously or via touch; some affect only channelers or affect them differently.\n\n==== Talents ====\nRobert Jordan uses the capitalized word \"Talent\" to refer to two distinct types of abilities sometimes possessed by channelers; the text also sometimes uses \"Talent\" to refer to abilities unrelated to the One Power and possessed by non-channelers.\n\nOne type of Talent is the aptitude for a particular weave or type of weave. Talents seen in the series include healing (Nynaeve al'Meara), manipulating weather (many Windfinders), creating \"gateways\" for instantaneous travel (Androl Genhald), and fabricating the indestructible substance \"cuendillar\" (Egwene al'Vere). Such a Talent may manifest as finer control over weaves, the ability to use a weave that would otherwise be beyond the channeler's strength, superior results when using a weave with all other factors equal, or some combination of these benefits. Some weaves, such as creating cuendillar, function only for a channeler with a corresponding Talent.\n\nA Talent can also be some other ability possessed only by some channelers, but distinct from creating weaves of the One Power. Talents of this type include creating ter'angreal (Elayne Trakand), perceiving the purpose or function of a ter'angreal (Aviendha), analyzing an expended weave, \"unweaving\" a weave (Aviendha), predicting the weather (Nynaeve al'Meara), recognizing ta'veren on sight (Siuan Sanche and Logain Ablar), and \"Foretelling\" prophecy (Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan).  The latter three Talents have no obvious connection to the One Power, but are described as occurring only in channelers.\n\n=== Other abilities ===\nSome abilities depicted in the Wheel of Time are not related to the One Power or the ability to channel.\n\n\"Dreaming\" (an Aes Sedai term) is the ability to have prophetic dreams, which are usually symbolic rather than literal. \"Dreamwalking\" (an Aiel term) is a set of abilities involving dreaming, including the ability to visit Tel'aran'rhiod and the dreams of others at will, and aptitude for manipulating Tel'aran'rhiod.  Egwene al'Vere is both a Dreamer and Dreamwalker, and the text never establishes whether or not these are two separate things. Dreamwalking is well known to the Aiel Wise ones, who use it for society-wide communication; Aiel Dreamwalkers include channelers Amys and Melaine and the non-channeler Bair, who become Egwene's teachers as the last Aes Sedai Dreamer died about five hundred years earlier.  No man is explicitly identified as a Dreamwalker in the series, but many of the male and female Forsaken, Shai'tan's top lieutenants, appear in Tel'aran'rhiod, and the male Forsaken Ishamael projects himself into other characters' dreams.\n\n\"Ta'veren\" are individuals who are focal points of the Pattern for a time.  Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all ta'veren during the events of the series. The Pattern causes events and the actions of others surrounding a ta'veren to conform to the ta'veren's [[destiny]], usually resulting in occurrences that are possible but unlikely.  Mat has exceptionally good luck at gambling and in battle, while Perrin easily earns the support of others.  Rand's presence often affects a large area around himself, causing such anomalies as one entire village pairing off in marriage in one day, another village erupting into violence over every disagreement its residents ever had, and a city's newborns being free of [[birth defect]]s during Rand's residency.\n\nRand al'Thor is also the \"Dragon Reborn,\" a prophesied savior.  Towards the end of the series, Rand is revealed to be a human tree singer a lost art. He is also shown to have reality warping abilities related to the Dragon Reborn's connection to the Pattern; he kindles a pipe without channeling.\n\nPerrin Aybara and Elyas Machera are \"Wolfbrothers,\" individuals who can communicate telepathically with wolves, which are depicted as [[Sapience|sapient]].  Wolfbrothers also have abilities similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking, although they are not shown as capable of entering the dreams of others. The souls of wolves inhabit Tel'aran'rhiod, which they call the \"wolf dream,\" and a Wolfbrother who loses his identity as a man may become a wolf there.  Only male Wolfbrothers are depicted in the series.\n\nMin Farshaw sees [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] and images around people; she does not always understand these visions, but sometimes she instinctively understands them and is always correct in such cases.  Min is the only person in the series depicted as having this ability.  However, the superstitious Seanchan are apparently familiar with it and consider the images to be [[omen]]s; when Empress Fortuona learns that Min possesses this ability, she identifies Min as a \"Doomseer\" and immediately makes her a top advisor.\n\nHurin is a \"sniffer,\" one who can detect violence as an unpleasant odor.  This ability is apparently accepted by his countrymen; it is considered an asset for his career in law enforcement, and Perrin pretends to be a sniffer to conceal that the true source of his insight is communication with wolves.\n\nThe Seanchan produce ter'angreal rings that, when touched with the wearer's blood, grant him or her the abilities of a \"Bloodknife\":  increased strength and speed and the ability to blend into shadows, at the cost of dying within a matter of days or weeks.\n\nThe books describe several scenarios where Shai'tan gives powers to individuals.  People whose souls are removed by Shai'tan become supernaturally inconspicuous \"Gray Men,\" ideal assassins.  Padan Fain serves Shai'tan and is given the ability to track Rand al'Thor. Padan Fain later merges with the ghost of the evil Mordeth, gaining the abilities to inculcate others with paranoia and to summon and control a deadly miasma.  Shai'tan merges the bodies and souls of Isam Mandragoran and Luc Mantear into the individual known as Slayer, to whom Shai'tan grants powers involving Tel'aran'rhiod, including the ability to travel instantaneously between there and the physical world while awake and without the use of a gateway.\n\n== Books in the series ==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall= |title= |airdate=

Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons were Robert Jordan's editorial assistants. The book is an encapsulating glossary of the entire series.\n\n==Development==\n===Writing and conception===\nIn the early 1980s Robert Jordan wrote several [[Conan the Barbarian]] novels for Tor Books, including a [[novelization]] of the movie ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. These proved successful and in 1984 he proposed an idea for an epic fantasy series of three books to Tom Doherty, the head of [[Tor Books]].<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/> Doherty approved the idea; however, knowing that Jordan had a tendency to go long, Doherty put Jordan on contract for six books just in case.  Jordan began writing the novel that became ''The Eye of the World''.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nThe novel proved extremely difficult to write and characters and storylines changed considerably during the writing process. The series was originally centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of [[J. R. R.

Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called ''New Spring'', so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes, but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, ''[[Crossroads of Twilight]]'' (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, ''[[Winter's Heart]]'', from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'', the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title ''A Memory of Light'', would conclude the series.\n\n===Author's death and final books===\n{{See also|A Memory of Light|The Gathering Storm (novel)|Towers of Midnight}}\nJordan had stated that the main sequence would conclude with the twelfth book, ''[[A Memory of Light]]''.

Notably, the ''WoTMUD'' had gained written permission from the author to use his creation including all but major characters.\n\nA [[The Wheel of Time (video game)|''Wheel of Time'' computer game]] was released in 1999. Over the course of the game, a lone Aes Sedai must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison.

Shortly after the release of the adventure book Wizards of the Coast announced they would not be releasing any further products for the game. Robert Jordan cited some problems with the roleplaying game, such as storyline details in the adventure module that contradicted the books.\n\nIn early 2009 [[Electronic Arts|EA Games]] announced that they had bought the rights for a MMORPG, with the plan to publish it through the EA Partners-Program.
