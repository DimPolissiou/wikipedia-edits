{"title_page": "Psychological horror", "text_new": "'''Psychological horror''' is a [[genre|subgenre]] of [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[psychological fiction]] that relies on mental, emotional and psychological [[Mental state|states]] to frighten, disturb, or unsettle its audience. The subgenre frequently overlaps with the related subgenre of [[psychological thriller]], and it often uses [[mystery fiction|mystery]] elements and characters with unstable, unreliable, or disturbed psychological states to enhance the [[suspense]], [[drama]], [[action (narrative)|action]], and [[paranoia]] of the setting and plot and to provide an overall unpleasant, unsettling, or distressing [[Mood (literature)|atmosphere]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nPsychological horror usually aims to create discomfort or dread by exposing common or universal psychological and emotional vulnerabilities/fears and revealing the darker parts of the human psyche that most people may repress or deny. This idea is referred to in [[analytical psychology]] as the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] characteristics: [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]], [[distrust]], [[Doubt|self-doubt]], and [[paranoia]] of others, themselves, and the world.\n\nThe genre sometimes seeks to challenge or confuse the audience's grasp of the narrative or plot by focusing on characters who are themselves unsure of or doubting their own perceptions of reality or questioning their own [[sanity]]. Characters' [[perception]]s of their surroundings or situations may indeed be distorted or subject to [[delusion]]s, outside manipulation or [[gaslighting]] by other characters, [[Mental disorder|emotional disturbances]], and even [[hallucination]]s or [[mental disorder]]s. In many cases, and in a similar way as the overlapping genre of [[psychological thriller]], psychological horror may deploy an [[unreliable narrator]] or imply that aspects of the story are being perceived inaccurately by a protagonist, thus confusing or unsettling viewers or readers and setting up an ominous or disturbing overarching tone. In other cases, the narrator or protagonist may be reliable or ostensibly mentally stable but is placed in a situation involving another character or characters who are psychologically, mentally, or emotionally disturbed. Thus, elements of psychological horror focus on mental conflicts. These become important as the characters face perverse situations, sometimes involving the [[supernatural]], [[immorality]], [[murder]], and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracies]].

In contrast, [[splatter film|splatter fiction]] focuses on bizarre, alien evil to which the average viewer cannot easily relate. However, at times, the psychological horror and splatter subgenres overlap, such as in the French horror film ''[[High Tension]]''.<ref name=\"JOAP\">{{cite journal |title=Psychoanalytic theory in times of terror |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |issue=48 |volume=4 |page=407 |date=September 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\nThe novel ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' written by [[Thomas Harris]], Robert Bloch novels such as ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[American Gothic (novel)|American Gothic]]'', [[Stephen King]] novels such as ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', ''[[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]]'', ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', and [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]'s novel ''[[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]]'' are some examples of psychological horror. [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is often viewed as one of the best examples of psychological horror in fiction.\n\n==Films==\nPsychological horror films generally differ from the [[horror film|traditional horror film]], where the source of the fear is typically something material, such as grotesque or horrifying [[Creature (2011 film)|creatures]], [[monster]]s, [[serial killer]]s, or [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]],{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}} as well as the [[splatter film]], which derives its frightening effects from gore and [[graphic violence]],{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}} in that tension in psychological horror films is more frequently built through atmosphere, eerie sounds and exploitation of the viewer's and the character's psychological fears. Psychological horror films sometimes frighten or unsettle by relying on the viewer's or character's own imagination or the anticipation of a threat rather than an actual threat or a material source of fear portrayed onscreen. However, some psychological horror films may in fact contain a material or overt threat or a physical source of fear, as well as scenes of graphic gore or violence, yet still rely or focus mainly on atmosphere and the psychological, mental, and emotional states of the characters and viewers to frighten or disturb. For instance, some psychological horror films may portray psychotic murderers and scenes of graphic violence while still maintaining an atmosphere that focuses on either the villain's, protagonist's, or audience's psychological, mental, or emotional status.\n\n''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934) and ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942) have been cited as early psychological horror films.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skal |first=David J. |title=The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror |date=15 October 2001 |publisher=Macmillan |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwlNnOxMt1gC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=YY4_ekXHDw&sig=rEK2aBBkpLYVz_6M0XIN7X277TY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0571199968}}</ref>{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Strinati |first=Dominic |title=An Introduction to Studying Popular Culture |date=31 August 2000 |publisher=Routledge |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4HqSHbXtMUC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=1GD-gRNshc&sig=2IdTy3HpoIG92pg0O6C_b1lyfzg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QddoUNzQKYmfiQes9oDoDw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0415157668}}</ref>\n\n[[Roman Polanski]] directed two films which are considered quintessential psychological horror: ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Browne |first1=Ray B. |last2=Browne |first2=Pat |title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture |date=15 June 2001 |publisher=Popular Press |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=opbm88BELR&sig=6_4Zs5Y41PGNy1Wld3nKIiBgoy8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0879728213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mazierska |first=Ewa |title=Roman Polanski: The Cinema of a Cultural Traveller |date=15 June 2007 |publisher=I.B.Taurus |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH9mYBGgKb8C&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=mlvkYuf2BD&sig=9bJ3fmNBFM1uvEcNZhre_93MiUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBTgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=1845112970}}</ref> [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', adapted from the aforementioned Stephen King novel, is another particularly well-known example of the genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kawin |first=Bruce F. |title=Horror and the Horror Film |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Anthem Press |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r88NdErN1pkC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=cIqp8sPul_&sig=aLbJmDM7U8la_GMbE-2nTv9okPo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0857284495}}</ref> ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] is another example of psychological horror, whilst also incorporating elements of the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS And Horror Aversion At The Oscars|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/01/16/the-silence-of-the-lambs-and-horror-aversion-at-the-oscars|website=birthmoviesdeath.com|publisher=Britt Hayes|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Psychological Horror Movies - Alternative Reel|url=http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000011|website=Alternative Reel|publisher=Alternative Reel|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Recent English-language films in the genre include [[Darren Aronofsky|Darren Aronofsky's]] ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[The Babadook]]'' (2014), ''[[It Follows]]'' (2015), ''[[Get Out]]'' (2017), ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'' (2018), and ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nThe [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] genre known as ''[[giallo]]'' often employs psychological horror or elements of the psychological horror subgenre.

For instance, some psychological horror films may portray psychotic murderers and scenes of graphic violence while still maintaining an atmosphere that focuses on either the villain's, protagonist's, or audience's psychological, mental, or emotional status.\n\n''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934) and ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942) have been cited as early psychological horror films.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skal |first=David J. |title=The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror |date=15 October 2001 |publisher=Macmillan |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwlNnOxMt1gC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=YY4_ekXHDw&sig=rEK2aBBkpLYVz_6M0XIN7X277TY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0571199968}}</ref>{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Strinati |first=Dominic |title=An Introduction to Studying Popular Culture |date=31 August 2000 |publisher=Routledge |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4HqSHbXtMUC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=1GD-gRNshc&sig=2IdTy3HpoIG92pg0O6C_b1lyfzg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QddoUNzQKYmfiQes9oDoDw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0415157668}}</ref>\n\n[[Roman Polanski]] directed two films which are considered quintessential psychological horror: ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Browne |first1=Ray B. |last2=Browne |first2=Pat |title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture |date=15 June 2001 |publisher=Popular Press |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=opbm88BELR&sig=6_4Zs5Y41PGNy1Wld3nKIiBgoy8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0879728213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mazierska |first=Ewa |title=Roman Polanski: The Cinema of a Cultural Traveller |date=15 June 2007 |publisher=I.B.Taurus |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH9mYBGgKb8C&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=mlvkYuf2BD&sig=9bJ3fmNBFM1uvEcNZhre_93MiUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBTgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=1845112970}}</ref> [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', adapted from the aforementioned Stephen King novel, is another particularly well-known example of the genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kawin |first=Bruce F. |title=Horror and the Horror Film |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Anthem Press |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r88NdErN1pkC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=cIqp8sPul_&sig=aLbJmDM7U8la_GMbE-2nTv9okPo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0857284495}}</ref> ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] is another example of psychological horror, whilst also incorporating elements of the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS And Horror Aversion At The Oscars|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/01/16/the-silence-of-the-lambs-and-horror-aversion-at-the-oscars|website=birthmoviesdeath.com|publisher=Britt Hayes|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Psychological Horror Movies - Alternative Reel|url=http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000011|website=Alternative Reel|publisher=Alternative Reel|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Recent English-language films in the genre include [[Darren Aronofsky|Darren Aronofsky's]] ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[The Babadook]]'' (2014), ''[[It Follows]]'' (2015), ''[[Get Out]]'' (2017), ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'' (2018), and ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nThe [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] genre known as ''[[giallo]]'' often employs psychological horror or elements of the psychological horror subgenre.

He recommended burning all the piles of seeds and cotton that existed in the Valleys.

In addition, he was Vice Chancellor of the University in 1834 and principal director of the Faculty of Medicine the following year. In 1846 he occupied the position of Rector of the UCV.
