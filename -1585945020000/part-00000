Produced by [[TMS Entertainment]] under partnership with Sega and [[Sonic Team]], and directed by Hajime Kamegaki, ''Sonic X'' initially ran for fifty-two episodes, broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004. A further 26 episodes aired in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]] from 2005 to 2006. The show's American [[language localization|localization]] and broadcasting were handled by [[4Kids Entertainment]], which [[editing of anime in American distribution|edited it]] and created new music.\n\nThe series follows a group of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals who accidentally teleport from their home planet to [[Earth]] after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy [[Doctor Eggman]]. Separated, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is saved by a [[human]] boy named Chris Thorndyke, who helps him find his friends while repeatedly scuffling with Doctor Eggman and his robots over control of the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]], and becoming [[celebrities]]. The final story arc sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of aliens called the Metarex.\n\n''Sonic X'' received mixed reviews. Generally, writers criticized its American localization and some characters, but praised its story and aesthetics. The series was popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show's merchandise included an [[edutainment]] video game for the [[Leapster]], a [[trading card game]], a [[comic book]] series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items. The phrase \"gotta go fast\", the title of the show's North American theme song, survived as a ''Sonic'' catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Sonic X episodes|Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Battle}}\n\n===Season 1===\n[[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]] and [[Amy Rose]] are trying to rescue [[Cream the Rabbit]] and her pet [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]] Cheese from [[Doctor Eggman]], who has already retrieved the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]]. While attempting to destroy his base, one of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the \"Chaos Control\" technique. This teleports Sonic, Eggman (and his robots), Tails, Amy, Cream, and Cheese, as well as [[Big the Cat]] (with his frog Froggy), [[Rouge the Bat]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and the [[Chaotix]] (a [[detective]] crew comprising [[Espio the Chameleon]], [[Vector the Crocodile]], and [[Charmy Bee]]) to [[Earth]], the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] version of their world with [[humans]]. Sonic is chased by police, escapes into a mansion's swimming pool, and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there with his movie-star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka. Chris tries to hide the anthropomorphic friends from his family until Cream accidentally reveals them, but they all build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.\n\nSonic and his friends still want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Doctor Eggman, his robot assistants\u2014the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe\u2014and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans to take over the world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes.\n\n===Season 2===\nEggman awakens a creature named [[Chaos (Sonic)|Chaos]] from the Master Emerald. The animals fight a losing battle to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named [[Tikal the Echidna|Tikal]], who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]], he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.\n\nShortly afterwards, Eggman finds his grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]'s diary and Gerald's old project [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]] in a military base. After being released by Eggman, Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the Space Colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the [[Moon]] to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause Space Colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour. Gerald did this in order to exact revenge on humanity, who he blamed for the death of his Granddaughter Maria after she was killed in a government raid on Space Colony ARK. Everyone teams up and works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic and believes he has fulfilled his purpose of revenge. Chris confronts Shadow, reminding him of Maria's last wish for Shadow to be a protector of humanity, to guide and aid them. Moved to tears and with a new sense of purpose, Shadow teams up with Sonic and both power up using the Emeralds and teleport the ARK away from Earth, though Shadow is seeming killed in the process.  Sonic, his friends, and Eggman reflect on Shadow's sacrifice and return to Earth.\n\nEggman rebuilds the Moon, seemingly out of remorse, but its position shifts, creating a [[solar eclipse]], so he manufactures and sells \"Sunshine Balls\" to replicate sunlight. Sonic sees through his greedy motivations, and Eggman is arrested for fraud. Bokkun activates a robot named [[Sonic Battle|Emerl]], who quickly allies with the anthropomorphic people, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous hero and villain characters, but he goes berserk and begins to wreck the city, forcing Cream and Cheese to destroy him.\n\nLater, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that Sonic's world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, and the only way to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. Chris tearfully acknowledges that he bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.\n\n===Season 3===\nSix months later, a race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where [[time dilation|six years have passed]] and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device to return to his friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, ''The Blue Typhoon''. On the ''Typhoon'', they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and \"Planet Eggs\" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.)  At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metarex independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an [[undercover agent|unwitting spy ever since]]. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely [[deafblindness|destroy her sight and hearing]] forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses to find a way to remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.\n\nThe heroes, along with the Chaotix and Shadow, head to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet that is made of water and contains a Planet Egg. After Sonic almost drowns in it, the planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that, because they have lost the battle, they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. The Metarex then proceed to fuse together, forming a dragon-like plant monster that attaches itself to the giant seed. Sonic and Shadow use the chaos emerald to become Super Sonic and Super Shadow but are still unable to defeat the fused Metarex. Cosmo sees a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] from her mother Earthia, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She fuses with the giant seed and instructs Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed. Tails hesitates, torn between saving the galaxy and killing Cosmo, but eventually finds the inner strength and annihilates the Metarex along with Cosmo, whose seed disperse throughout the galaxy along with the Planet Eggs stolen by the Metarex which return to their original planets. Dark Oak has a moment of repentance before dying while having a vision of being greeted by Earthia as he passes away. Shadow then apparently sacrifices himself to contain the ensuing explosion. After the battle, Sonic reappears and solemnly informs a heartbroken Tails that he could not save Cosmo and hands him one of her seeds. Back on Sonic's planet Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home, later claiming that this was done to reduce the strength of Team Sonic. The series ends with Chris returning home and business as usual for Sonic and his friends as they joyfully gear up to once again put a stop to Eggman's schemes. The final shots show Shadow on an alien planet and Cosmo's seed sprouting in Tails' workshop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation and development===\nThe show was created by [[TMS Entertainment]], the animation subsidiary of SEGA Holdings Co., Ltd.<ref name=\"them\"/> It was the first [[anime]] series based on the ''Sonic'' universe. It was primarily influenced by other anime rather than work from the West, and was created for a Japanese audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5387184/why-sega-handed-sonic-over-to-western-studios-and-gave-him-a-scarf |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |title=Why Sega handed Sonic over to Western studios and gave him a scarf |date=February 6, 2014 |last=Corriea |first=Alexa Ray |accessdate=July 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705002244/http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5387184/why-sega-handed-sonic-over-to-western-studios-and-gave-him-a-scarf |archivedate=July 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Yuji Naka]], then the head of [[Sonic Team]], filled in as executive producer, and Satoshi Hirayama designed all of the original characters, basing the designs on [[Yuji Uekawa]]'s original concept.\nMost of the series consists of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', and ''[[Sonic Battle]]''. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined [[CGI animation|CGI]] elements for things such as Sonic's homing attack.<ref name=\"them\"/>\n\nTwo trailers for the series were produced. The first was developed before Cheese had been given a name in ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]'' (2002); it referred to Cheese simply as \"Chao\". It was made up largely of footage that would later appear in the series' intro, but also of unused scenes featuring unique anthropomorphic people.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7AqlIp5evA |medium=YouTube |year=2002 |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |title=Sonic |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117063855/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7AqlIp5evA |archivedate=November 17, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Sega showed off the second, which was narrated in Japanese, at its booth at the World Hobby Fair video gaming event in February 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/features/world_hobby_fair_2003/ |publisher=The Next Level |date=February 19, 2003 |title=Event Report: World Hobby Fair 2003 |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724190055/http://www.the-nextlevel.com/features/world_hobby_fair_2003/ |archivedate=July 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> It consisted mostly of scenes from the first few episodes, followed by introductions to the main characters.

Chris' voice actress [[Sanae Kobayashi]] was not sure she would be able to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. [[Chikao \u014ctsuka]], who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and the desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.<ref name=\"jpint\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030818220841/http://www.lycos.co.jp/anime/story.html?q=21nttpubn10|publisher=Lycos|script-title=ja:\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u901f\u306e\u9752\u3044\u30cf\u30ea\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3001\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01\u3000\u3053\u306e\u79cb\u306b\u306f\u4e16\u754c\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3060\uff01|language=Japanese|url=http://www.lycos.co.jp/anime/story.html?q=21nttpubn10|date=June 21, 2003|archivedate=August 18, 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIizuka believed that ''Sonic X'' and its merchandise, along with the game ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', had helped expose the ''Sonic'' franchise to a new generation of potential gamers in 2003, and he dubbed it a \"Sonic Year\" as a result.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/afterthoughts-sonic-heroes |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |title=Afterthoughts: Sonic Heroes |date=2004 |accessdate=September 15, 2014 |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604094138/http://www.1up.com/features/afterthoughts-sonic-heroes |url-status=dead }}</ref> More boldly, Naka hoped that ''Sonic X'' alone would cause the popularity of the ''Sonic'' series to skyrocket, as that of the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series did after its [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|anime adaptation]] was first released.<ref name=\"pokemon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-to-begin-major-sonic-promotion/1100-6023404/ |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=March 18, 2003 |title=Sega to begin major Sonic promotion |last=Niizumi |first=Hirohiko |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207134517/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-to-begin-major-sonic-promotion/1100-6023404/ |archivedate=December 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Broadcast and localization===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sonic X DVD.jpg|thumb|Cover art of the Spanish-language DVD of Season 2]] -->\n[[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] handled the show's American localization.

It is a fast-paced [[platform game|platform]]/[[action game|action]] game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction).<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Trading card game===\n[[Score Entertainment]] created a ''Sonic X'' [[collectible card game]] for two players released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with ''Sonic'' characters than like a wholly ''Sonic''-based product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |publisher=KidzWorld |title=Sonic X Card Game Review |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814102446/http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |archivedate=August 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nConrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its \"horrible localization\" as a main reason for negativity.<ref name=\"negativity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=April 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |title=Watch Sonic X on Hulu This Easter |last=Zimmerman |first=Conrad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122419/http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: \"It's really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers.\"<ref name=\"them\">{{cite web |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |publisher=THEM Anime |last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Sonic X |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915060412/http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |archivedate=September 15, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive.

Hedgehog]]'' video game series published by [[Sega]] and [[Sonic Team]]. Produced by [[TMS Entertainment]] under partnership with Sega and [[Sonic Team]], and directed by Hajime Kamegaki, ''Sonic X'' initially ran for fifty-two episodes, broadcasting on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004. A further 26 episodes aired in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]] from 2005 to 2006. The show's American [[language localization|localization]] and broadcasting were handled by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]]\u2014which [[editing of anime in American distribution|edited it]] and created new music\u2014until 2012, when [[Saban Brands]] obtained the rights to the series, and in 2015 by [[Discotek Media]].\n\nThe series follows a group of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals who accidentally teleport from their home planet to [[Earth]] after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy [[Doctor Eggman]]. Separated, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is saved by a [[human]] boy named Chris Thorndyke, who helps him find his friends while repeatedly scuffling with Doctor Eggman and his robots over control of the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]], and becoming [[celebrities]]. The final story arc sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of aliens called the Metarex.</onlyinclude>\n\n''Sonic X'' received mixed reviews. Generally, writers criticized its American localization and some characters, but praised its story and aesthetics. The series was popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show's merchandise included an [[edutainment]] video game for the [[Leapster]], a [[trading card game]], a [[comic book]] series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items. The phrase \"gotta go fast\", the title of the show's North American theme song, survived as a ''Sonic'' catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Sonic X episodes|Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Battle}}\n\n===Season 1===\n[[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]] and [[Amy Rose]] are trying to rescue [[Cream the Rabbit]] and her pet [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]] Cheese from [[Doctor Eggman]], who has already retrieved the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]]. While attempting to destroy his base, one of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the \"Chaos Control\" technique. This teleports Sonic, Eggman (and his robots), Tails, Amy, Cream, and Cheese, as well as [[Big the Cat]] (with his frog Froggy), [[Rouge the Bat]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and the [[Chaotix]] (a [[detective]] crew comprising [[Espio the Chameleon]], [[Vector the Crocodile]], and [[Charmy Bee]]) to [[Earth]], the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] version of their world with [[humans]]. Sonic is chased by police, escapes into a mansion's swimming pool, and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there with his movie-star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka. Chris tries to hide the anthropomorphic friends from his family until Cream accidentally reveals them, but they all build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.\n\nSonic and his friends still want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Doctor Eggman, his robot assistants\u2014the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe\u2014and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans to take over the world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes.\n\n===Season 2===\nEggman awakens a creature named [[Chaos (Sonic)|Chaos]] from the Master Emerald. The animals fight a losing battle to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named [[Tikal the Echidna|Tikal]], who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|Super Sonic]], he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.\n\nShortly afterwards, Eggman finds his grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]'s diary and Gerald's old project [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]] in a military base. After being released by Eggman, Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the Space Colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the [[Moon]] to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause Space Colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour. Gerald did this in order to exact revenge on humanity, who he blamed for the death of his Granddaughter Maria after she was killed in a government raid on Space Colony ARK. Everyone teams up and works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic and believes he has fulfilled his purpose of revenge. Chris confronts Shadow, reminding him of Maria's last wish for Shadow to be a protector of humanity, to guide and aid them. Moved to tears and with a new sense of purpose, Shadow teams up with Sonic and both power up using the Emeralds and teleport the ARK away from Earth, though Shadow is seeming killed in the process.  Sonic, his friends, and Eggman reflect on Shadow's sacrifice and return to Earth.\n\nEggman rebuilds the Moon, seemingly out of remorse, but its position shifts, creating a [[solar eclipse]], so he manufactures and sells \"Sunshine Balls\" to replicate sunlight. Sonic sees through his greedy motivations, and Eggman is arrested for fraud. Bokkun activates a robot named [[Sonic Battle|Emerl]], who quickly allies with the anthropomorphic people, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous hero and villain characters, but he goes berserk and begins to wreck the city, forcing Cream and Cheese to destroy him.\n\nLater, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that Sonic's world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, and the only way to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. Chris tearfully acknowledges that he bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.\n\n===Season 3===\nSix months later, a race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where [[time dilation|six years have passed]] and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device to return to his friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, ''The Blue Typhoon''. On the ''Typhoon'', they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and \"Planet Eggs\" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.)  At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metarex independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an [[undercover agent|unwitting spy ever since]]. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely [[deafblindness|destroy her sight and hearing]] forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses to find a way to remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.\n\nThe heroes, along with the Chaotix and Shadow, head to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet that is made of water and contains a Planet Egg. After Sonic almost drowns in it, the planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that, because they have lost the battle, they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. The Metarex then proceed to fuse together, forming a dragon-like plant monster that attaches itself to the giant seed. Sonic and Shadow use the chaos emerald to become Super Sonic and Super Shadow but are still unable to defeat the fused Metarex. Cosmo sees a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] from her mother Earthia, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She fuses with the giant seed and instructs Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed. Tails hesitates, torn between saving the galaxy and killing Cosmo, but eventually finds the inner strength and annihilates the Metarex along with Cosmo, whose seed disperse throughout the galaxy along with the Planet Eggs stolen by the Metarex which return to their original planets. Dark Oak has a moment of repentance before dying while having a vision of being greeted by Earthia as he passes away. Shadow then apparently sacrifices himself to contain the ensuing explosion. After the battle, Sonic reappears and solemnly informs a heartbroken Tails that he could not save Cosmo and hands him one of her seeds. Back on Sonic's planet Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home, later claiming that this was done to reduce the strength of Team Sonic. The series ends with Chris returning home and business as usual for Sonic and his friends as they joyfully gear up to once again put a stop to Eggman's schemes. The final shots show Shadow on an alien planet and Cosmo's seed sprouting in Tails' workshop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation and development===\nThe show was created by [[TMS Entertainment]], the animation subsidiary of SEGA Holdings Co., Ltd.<ref name=\"them\"/> It was the first [[anime]] series based on the ''Sonic'' universe.

Another Happy Meal game based on Big the Cat fishing arrived the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesasylum.com/2013/04/17/gaming-happy-meals-a-grease-covered-history/ |publisher=Games Asylum |last=Gander |first=Matt (of [[Retro Gamer]]) |date=April 17, 2013 |title=The history of fast-food freebies |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825171204/http://www.gamesasylum.com/2013/04/17/gaming-happy-meals-a-grease-covered-history/ |archivedate=August 25, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[LeapFrog Enterprises]] released a ''[[Sonic X (video game)|Sonic X]]'' [[educational entertainment|educational]] math game for its [[Leapster]] handheld game console; it was released in 2005 in North America<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, North American) boxart.</ref> and 2007 in Europe.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, European) boxart.</ref> The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced [[platform game|platform]]/[[action game|action]] game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction).<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Trading card game===\n[[Score Entertainment]] created a ''Sonic X'' [[collectible card game]] for two players released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with ''Sonic'' characters than like a wholly ''Sonic''-based product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |publisher=KidzWorld |title=Sonic X Card Game Review |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814102446/http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review |archivedate=August 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nConrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its \"horrible localization\" as a main reason for negativity.<ref name=\"negativity\">{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=April 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |title=Watch Sonic X on Hulu This Easter |last=Zimmerman |first=Conrad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122419/http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: \"It's really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers.\"<ref name=\"them\">{{cite web |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |publisher=THEM Anime |last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Sonic X |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915060412/http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355 |archivedate=September 15, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive.

Jones decried Chris as \"a dull, boring, uninspired character\" and also described Tanaka and Ella as \"bland\" stereotypes of [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|Japanese]] and [[Stereotypes of African Americans|African-Americans]], respectively. Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show's portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: {{\" '}}I'm gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Rings|Ring]] to defeat my enemies{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"them\"/> GamesRadar bemoaned both the \"piss-poor ''Adventure'' characters\" and the original human ones.<ref name=\"gamesradar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |author=GamesRadar_US |date=June 23, 2012 |title=The absolute worst Sonic moments |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010191612/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2 |archivedate=October 10, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that \"one of the key successes\" of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones like Big and the Chaotix.

It is the only [[Family (biology)|family]] in the '''Moniliformida''' [[Order (biology)|order]] and contains three [[genera]]: ''Australiformis'' containing a single species, ''Moniliformis'' containing eighteen species and ''Promoniliformis'' containing a single species. Genetic analysis have determined that the [[clade]] is [[monophyletic]] despite being distributed globally. These worms primarily [[Parasitism|parasitize]] mammals by attaching themselves into the intestinal wall using their hook-covered [[proboscis]]. The intermediate hosts are mostly cockroaches. The distinguishing features of this order among [[archiacanthocephala]]ns is the presence of a cylindrical proboscis with long rows of hooks with posteriorly directed roots and proboscis retractor muscles that pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle. Infestation with Monoliformida species can cause moniliformiasis, an intestinal condition characterized as causing [[lesions]], [[Abdominal distension|intestinal distension]], [[perforated ulcer]]s, [[enteritis]], [[gastritis]], [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypt]] [[hypertrophy]], [[goblet cell]] [[hyperplasia]], and blockages.\n\n==Taxonomy and description==\n\nSpecies of the family ''Moniliformidae'' are usually pseudosegmented and have a cylindrical proboscis with longitudinal rows of hooks that have posteriorly directed roots. Moniliformidae are further characterized by the presence of a simple, double-walled proboscis receptacle with the outer wall having spirally aligned muscle fibers (with the exception of ''Australiformis''), brain at posterior end of receptacle, and dorsal and ventral lacunar canals.<ref name=\"Schmidt1989\"/><ref name=\"K\u00fckenthal\">{{cite book |last=K\u00fckenthal|first=W |date=2014 |title=Gastrotricha and Gnathifera |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hwCTBgAAQBAJ&pg=PP11&dq=K%C3%BCkenthal,+W.+(2014).+Gastrotricha+and+Gnathifera.+Walter+de+Gruyter+GmbH+and+Co+KG.#v=onepage&q=apororhynchus&f=false |location=[[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |page=322 |isbn=978-3110274271}}</ref> The proboscis retractor muscles pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle.<ref name = \"Amin1987\">{{cite journal |last1=Amin |first1=O.

In the intermediate host, the acanthor, or the parasite in its first larval stage, morphs into the acanthella, the second larval stage. After 6 to 12 weeks in this stage, the acanthella becomes a cystacanth. The cystacanth, or infective acanthella, of ''M. moniliformis'' are cyst-shaped and encyst in the tissues of the intermediate hosts in contrast to most other acanthocephalans which have infective larvae that more closely resemble underdeveloped adult worms. The definitive hosts consume the cystacanths upon feeding on infested intermediate hosts. These cystacanths mature and mate in the small intestine in 8 to 12 weeks. After this time, the eggs are excreted with the feces, to be ingested yet again by another intermediate host and renew this cycle.<ref name = \"CDC\" />   In what is commonly known as \"brain-jacking,\" the parasite induces a behavioural change in its intermediate host that increases the risk of predation for the host. It is thought that this behavioral change holds an evolutionary advantage for the parasite by increasing its chances of getting to its definitive host. When ''M. moniliformis'' infests its intermediate host, the cockroach species ''[[Periplaneta americana]]'', it changes the cockroach's escape response. In one study, it was concluded that cockroaches infected by ''M. moniliformis'' took longer to respond to wind stimuli simulating the approach of a potential predator and displayed fewer escape responses implying that the parasite infection renders its intermediate host more vulnerable to predation by hindering its ability to detect and escape from its predator. It is thought that serotonin plays a role in upending the communication between giant interneurons and the thoracic interneurons and in turn hampers the escape response of the cockroach.<ref name=\"Berenji2007\"/> In a similar study, the effects of parasitism on three [[Periplaneta]] species found that ''[[Periplaneta australasiae]]'' uses substrates differently and moves around less when infected with ''M. moniliformis''.<ref name = \"Moore 1994\">{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = J. | last2 = Freehling | first2 = M. | last3 = Gotelli | first3 = N.

These worms primarily [[Parasitism|parasitize]] mammals by attaching themselves into the intestinal wall using their hook-covered [[proboscis]]. The intermediate hosts are mostly cockroaches. The distinguishing features of this order among [[archiacanthocephala]]ns is the presence of a cylindrical proboscis with long rows of hooks with posteriorly directed roots and proboscis retractor muscles that pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle. Infestation with Monoliformida species can cause moniliformiasis, an intestinal condition characterized as causing [[lesions]], [[Abdominal distension|intestinal distension]], [[perforated ulcer]]s, [[enteritis]], [[gastritis]], [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypt]] [[hypertrophy]], [[goblet cell]] [[hyperplasia]], and blockages.\n\n==Taxonomy and description==\n\nSpecies of the family ''Moniliformidae'' are usually pseudosegmented and have a cylindrical proboscis with longitudinal rows of hooks that have posteriorly directed roots.

In the intermediate host, the acanthor, or the parasite in its first larval stage, morphs into the acanthella, the second larval stage. After 6 to 12 weeks in this stage, the acanthella becomes a cystacanth. The cystacanth, or infective acanthella, of ''M. moniliformis'' are cyst-shaped and encyst in the tissues of the intermediate hosts in contrast to most other acanthocephalans which have infective larvae that more closely resemble underdeveloped adult worms. The definitive hosts consume the cystacanths upon feeding on infested intermediate hosts. These cystacanths mature and mate in the small intestine in 8 to 12 weeks. After this time, the eggs are excreted with the feces, to be ingested yet again by another intermediate host and renew this cycle.<ref name = \"CDC\" />   In what is commonly known as \"brain-jacking,\" the parasite induces a behavioural change in its intermediate host that increases the risk of predation for the host. It is thought that this behavioral change holds an evolutionary advantage for the parasite by increasing its chances of getting to its definitive host. When ''M. moniliformis'' infests its intermediate host, the cockroach species ''[[Periplaneta americana]]'', it changes the cockroach's escape response. In one study, it was concluded that cockroaches infected by ''M. moniliformis'' took longer to respond to wind stimuli simulating the approach of a potential predator and displayed fewer escape responses implying that the parasite infection renders its intermediate host more vulnerable to predation by hindering its ability to detect and escape from its predator. It is thought that serotonin plays a role in upending the communication between giant interneurons and the thoracic interneurons and in turn hampers the escape response of the cockroach.<ref name=\"Berenji2007\"/> In a similar study, the effects of parasitism on three [[Periplaneta]] species found that ''[[Periplaneta australasiae]]'' uses substrates differently and moves around less when infected with ''M. moniliformis''.<ref name = \"Moore 1994\">{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = J. | last2 = Freehling | first2 = M. | last3 = Gotelli | first3 = N.
