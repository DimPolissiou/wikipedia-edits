The islands are administratively part of [[Krabi Province]]. [[Ko Phi Phi Don]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi don''}}) (''ko'' {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30}} 'island') is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, [[Ko Phi Phi Le]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi le''}}) are visited by many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Bamboo Island ([[Ko Mai Phai]]), are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting out of the sea. The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \"Viking Cave\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting [[edible bird's nest]]s.\n\nKo Phi Phi was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004]], when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sunset over a gypsy boat on Koh Phi Phi Island.jpg|thumb|Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi]]\nFrom archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]]. The original name for the islands was ''Pulau Api-Api'' ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the ''Pokok Api-Api'', or \"fiery tree\" ([[Avicennia marina|grey mangrove]]) which is found on the islands.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} southeast of Phuket and are part of [[Hat Nopparat Thara-Ko Phi Phi National Park]]. The national park covers an area of 242,437 [[Rai (unit)|rai]] (38,790 ha).<ref name=DNP>{{cite web|title=Hat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park|url=http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=35&lg=2|website=Department of National Parks (DNP)|accessdate=15 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121165210/http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=35&lg=2|archivedate=21 January 2015}}</ref> which is home to an abundance of corals and marine life.

There are nine settlements under these two villages.\n\nThe villages are:\n*Laem Thong (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e15\u0e07, Mu 8, between 300-500 people)\n:* Ban Ko Mai Phai (about 20 fishermen live on this island)\n:* Ban Laem Tong\n:* Ao Loh Bakhao\n:* Ao Lana\n\n*[[Ko Phi Phi Don|Ko Phi Phi]] (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35, Mu 7, between 1,500 - 2,000 people)\n:* Ao Maya (about 10 people, mostly in the ranger station)\n:* Ton Sai, the capital and largest settlement\n:* Hat Yao\n:* Ao Lodalum\n:* Laem Pho\n\n== Climate ==\nHat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between {{convert|17|\u2013|37|C|F}}. Average rainfall per year is about {{convert|2,231|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}, with wettest month being July and the driest February.<ref name=DNP/>\n\n== Transportation and communication==\n;Roads\nSince the re-building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n;Ferry\nThere are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\nMarine Discovery Centre, located at Loh Ba Gao Bay on Koh Phi Phi Don, houses a series of colourful, interactive displays explaining the life cycles and habits of many marine species endemic to the Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park, as well as information on area natural attractions and a gift shop. \n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phiphidivecamp.com |title=PhiPhiDiveCamp.com |publisher=Phiphidivecamp.com |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707043309/http://www.phiphidivecamp.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref> was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay.\n\nBy the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. \"We try and do as much as possible by hand,\" said Kok, \"that way we can search for passports and identification.\" The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored. HI Phi Phi was nominated for a ''Time Magazine'' Heroes of Asia award.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Andrew |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2005/heroes/hi_phi_phi.html |work=Time |title=Help International Phi Phi |date=2005-10-03 |accessdate=2012-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226085802/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2005/heroes/hi_phi_phi.html |archive-date=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs of 6 December 2005, nearly 1,500 hotel rooms were open, and a tsunami early-warning alarm system had been installed by the Thai government with the help of volunteers.\n\n==Impact of mass tourism==\n[[File:Bryde\u00b4s whale.jpg|thumb|[[Bryde's whale]] swims off the islands]]\nSince the tsunami, Phi Phi has come under greater threat from mass tourism. Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily. This figure does not include those who arrive by chartered speedboat or yacht. Phi Phi produces about {{convert|25|t|ST}} of solid waste a day, rising to {{convert|40|t|ST}} during the high season and most of this waste leaves Phi Phi island into the ocean - untreated; in fact, Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phi-Phi-Island-releases-83-wastewater-untreated|title=Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated|last=Gazette|first=Legacy Phuket|date=2016-03-03|website=The Thaiger|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> All tourists arriving on the island pay a 20-baht fee at Ton Sai Pier to assist in \"keeping Ko Phi Phi clean\". \"We collect up to 20,000 baht a day from tourists at the pier. The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

The islands are administratively part of [[Krabi Province]]. [[Ko Phi Phi Don]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi don''}}) (''ko'' {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30}} 'island') is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, [[Ko Phi Phi Le]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi le''}}) are visited by many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Bamboo Island ([[Ko Mai Phai]]), are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting out of the sea. The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \"Viking Cave\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting [[edible bird's nest]]s.\n\nKo Phi Phi was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004]], when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sunset over a gypsy boat on Koh Phi Phi Island.jpg|thumb|Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi]]\nFrom archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]]. The original name for the islands was ''Pulau Api-Api'' ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the ''Pokok Api-Api'', or \"fiery tree\" ([[Avicennia marina|grey mangrove]]) which is found on the islands.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} southeast of Phuket and are part of [[Hat Nopparat Thara-Ko Phi Phi National Park]].

There are nine settlements under these two villages.\n\nThe villages are:\n*Laem Thong (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e15\u0e07, Mu 8, between 300-500 people)\n:* Ban Ko Mai Phai (about 20 fishermen live on this island)\n:* Ban Laem Tong\n:* Ao Loh Bakhao\n:* Ao Lana\n\n*[[Ko Phi Phi Don|Ko Phi Phi]] (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35, Mu 7, between 1,500 - 2,000 people)\n:* Ao Maya (about 10 people, mostly in the ranger station)\n:* Ton Sai, the capital and largest settlement\n:* Hat Yao\n:* Ao Lodalum\n:* Laem Pho\n\n== Climate ==\nHat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between {{convert|17|\u2013|37|C|F}}. Average rainfall per year is about {{convert|2,231|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}, with wettest month being July and the driest February.<ref name=DNP/>\n\n== Transportation and communication==\n;Roads\nSince the re-building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n;Ferry\nThere are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phiphidivecamp.com |title=PhiPhiDiveCamp.com |publisher=Phiphidivecamp.com |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707043309/http://www.phiphidivecamp.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref> was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay.\n\nBy the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. \"We try and do as much as possible by hand,\" said Kok, \"that way we can search for passports and identification.\" The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored.

Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily.

The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there.

It is said that by listening to his father's recitations, Hafez had accomplished the task of learning the [[Quran]] by heart at an early age (that is [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|the meaning of the word ''Hafez'']]). At the same time, he is said to have known by heart the works of [[Rumi]] ([[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi]]), [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Attar Neyshapuri|Farid ud-Din]], and [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]].\n\nAccording to one tradition, before meeting his self-chosen [[Sufi]] master [[Hajji Zayn al-Attar]], Hafez had been working in a bakery, delivering bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty but knowing that his love for her would [[Unrequited love|not be requited]], he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an [[angel]], and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of [[Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]].\n\nAt 60, he is said to have begun a ''[[Chilla-nashini]]'', a 40-day-and-night vigil by sitting in a circle that he had drawn for himself. On the 40th day, he once again met with Zayn al-Attar on what is known to be their fortieth anniversary and was offered a cup of [[Shirazi wine|wine]]. It was there where he is said to have attained \"Cosmic Consciousness\". He hints at this episode in one of his verses in which he advises the reader to attain \"clarity of wine\" by letting it \"sit for 40 days\".\n\nIn one tale, [[Tamerlane]] (Timur) angrily summoned Hafez to account for one of his verses:\n{{poemquote|text=If that Shirazi Turk would take my heart in hand\nI would remit Samarkand and Bukh\u0101r\u0101 for her black mole.}}\n[[Samarkand]] was Tamerlane's capital and [[Bokhara]] was the kingdom's finest city. \"With the blows of my lustrous sword\", Timur complained, \"I have subjugated most of the habitable globe... to embellish Samarkand and Bokhara, the seats of my government; and you would sell them for the black mole of some girl in Shiraz!\"\n\nHafez, the tale goes, bowed deeply and replied, \"Alas, O Prince, it is this prodigality which is the cause of the misery in which you find me\". So surprised and pleased was Timur with this response that he dismissed Hafez with handsome gifts.<ref name=\"Gray\"/>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Hafez Ghazal.jpg|thumbnail|right|A [[couplet]] versified by Hafez in  [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq]].]]\n\n===Intellectual and artistic legacy===\nHafez was acclaimed throughout the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] during his lifetime, with other [[Lists of Persian poets|Persian poets]] imitating his work, and offers of patronage from Baghdad to India.<ref name=Gray/>\n\nHis work was first translated into English in 1771 by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]].

In composing poems of mystic content, they imbued every word and image with mystical undertones, causing mysticism and lyricism to converge into a single tradition. As a result, no fourteenth-century Persian poet could write a [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poem]] without having a flavor of mysticism forced on it by the poetic vocabulary itself.<ref>Thackston, Wheeler: ''A Millennium of Classical Persian Poetry'', Ibex Publishers Inc. 1994, p.&nbsp;ix in \"Introduction\"</ref><ref>Davis, Dick, \"On Not Translating Hafez\" in the ''[[New England Review]]'' 25:1-2 [2004]: 310-18</ref> While some poets, such as [[Ubayd Zakani]], attempted to distance themselves from this fused mystical-lyrical tradition by writing [[satire]]s, Hafez embraced the fusion and thrived on it. [[Wheeler Thackston]] has said of this that Hafez \"sang a rare blend of human and mystic love so balanced... that it is impossible to separate one from the other\".<ref>[[Wheeler Thackston|Thackston, Wheeler]], ''A Millennium of Classical Persian Poetry'', Ibex Publishers Inc.' 1994, p.64</ref> \n\nFor reason such as that, the history of the translation of H\u0101fez is fraught with complications, and few translations into western languages have been wholly successful.\n\nOne of the figurative gestures for which he is most famous (and which is among the most difficult to translate) is ''[[\u012bh\u0101m]]'' or artful [[pun]]ning. Thus, a word such as ''gowhar'', which could mean both \"essence, truth\" and \"pearl,\" would take on ''both'' meanings at once as in a phrase such as \"a pearl/essential truth outside the shell of superficial existence\".\n\nHafez often took advantage of the aforementioned lack of distinction between lyrical, mystical, and [[panegyric]] writing by using highly intellectualized, elaborate [[metaphor]]s and images to suggest multiple possible meanings. For example, a [[couplet]] from one of Hafez's poems reads:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}<!--whose translation? Source?-->\n{{poemquote|Last night, from the cypress branch, the nightingale sang,\nIn Old Persian tones, the lesson of spiritual stations.}}\n\nThe [[cypress]] tree is a symbol both of the beloved and of a regal presence; the [[Common nightingale|nightingale]] and birdsong evoke the traditional setting for human love. The \"lessons of spiritual stations\" suggest, obviously, a mystical undertone as well (though the word for \"spiritual\" could also be translated as \"intrinsically meaningful\"). Therefore, the words could signify at once a prince addressing his devoted followers, a lover courting a beloved, and the reception of spiritual wisdom.<ref>Meisami, Julie Scott (May, 1985). \"Allegorical Gardens in the Persian Poetic Tradition: Nezami, Rumi, Hafez.\" ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' 17(2), 229-260</ref>\n\n== Satire, religion, and politics  ==\n[[File:Hafis-Goethe-Denkmal in Weimar.jpg|thumb|Hafez-Goethe monument in [[Weimar]], Germany]]\nThough Hafez is well known for his poetry, he is less commonly recognized for his intellectual and political contributions.<ref>[http://www.hawzah.net/fa/magazine/magart/3282/4773/39121# Hafez, singing love Mahmood Soree, Golbarg magazine, mehr 1382, number 43]</ref> A defining feature of Hafez' poetry is its [[irony|ironic tone]] and the theme of hypocrisy, widely believed to be a critique of the religious and ruling establishments of the time.<ref name=\"views\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=98s_RXcO2c4C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=Amir+Mobarez+Din+Mohammad&source=bl&ots=cZh_56OsbH&sig=DyDIytnAPRcHbtzGCvlmsFzDtnY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAmoVChMI_aOc_b2hxwIVSWw-Ch2n_A0a#v=onepage&q=hafez&f=false Views from the Edge]</ref><ref name=\"aftabir\">[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/art_culture/literature_verse/c5c1230197619_hafez_p1.php/\u0637\u0646\u0632-\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez humor aftabir.com]</ref> [[Persian satire]] developed during the 14th century, within the courts of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol Period]].

It is said that by listening to his father's recitations, Hafez had accomplished the task of learning the [[Quran]] by heart at an early age (that is [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|the meaning of the word ''Hafez'']]). At the same time, he is said to have known by heart the works of [[Rumi]] ([[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi]]), [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Attar Neyshapuri|Farid ud-Din]], and [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]].\n\nAccording to one tradition, before meeting his self-chosen [[Sufi]] master [[Hajji Zayn al-Attar]], Hafez had been working in a bakery, delivering bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty but knowing that his love for her would [[Unrequited love|not be requited]], he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an [[angel]], and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of [[Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]].\n\nAt 60, he is said to have begun a ''[[Chilla-nashini]]'', a 40-day-and-night vigil by sitting in a circle that he had drawn for himself. On the 40th day, he once again met with Zayn al-Attar on what is known to be their fortieth anniversary and was offered a cup of [[Shirazi wine|wine]]. It was there where he is said to have attained \"Cosmic Consciousness\". He hints at this episode in one of his verses in which he advises the reader to attain \"clarity of wine\" by letting it \"sit for 40 days\".\n\nIn one tale, [[Tamerlane]] (Timur) angrily summoned Hafez to account for one of his verses:\n{{poemquote|text=If that Shirazi Turk would take my heart in hand\nI would remit Samarkand and Bukh\u0101r\u0101 for her black mole.}}\n[[Samarkand]] was Tamerlane's capital and [[Bokhara]] was the kingdom's finest city. \"With the blows of my lustrous sword\", Timur complained, \"I have subjugated most of the habitable globe... to embellish Samarkand and Bokhara, the seats of my government; and you would sell them for the black mole of some girl in Shiraz!\"\n\nHafez, the tale goes, bowed deeply and replied, \"Alas, O Prince, it is this prodigality which is the cause of the misery in which you find me\". So surprised and pleased was Timur with this response that he dismissed Hafez with handsome gifts.<ref name=\"Gray\"/>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Hafez Ghazal.jpg|thumbnail|right|A [[couplet]] versified by Hafez in  [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq]].]]\n\n===Intellectual and artistic legacy===\nHafez was acclaimed throughout the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] during his lifetime, with other [[Lists of Persian poets|Persian poets]] imitating his work, and offers of patronage from Baghdad to India.<ref name=Gray/>\n\nHis work was first translated into English in 1771 by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]].

Among Iranian singers, [[Mohsen Namjoo]] composed music and vocals on several poems such as ''Zolf'', ''Del Miravad'', ''Nameh'', and others. [[Hayedeh]] performed the song \"Padeshah-e Khooban\", with music by [[Farid Zoland]].  [[Mohammad-Reza Shajarian]] performed the song \"Del Miravad Ze Dastam\", with music by [[Parviz Meshkatian]]. The Ottoman composer [[Buhurizade Mustafa Itri]] composed his magnum opus Neva K\u00e2r based upon one of Hafez's poems. The Polish composer [[Karol Szymanowski]] composed [[The Love Songs of Hafiz]] based upon a German translation of Hafez poems.\n\n===In Afghan music===\nMany Afghan Singers, including [[Ahmad Zahir]] and [[Sarban (singer)|Sarban]], have composed songs such as \"Ay Padeshah-e Khooban\", \"Gar-Zulfe Parayshanat\"\n\n==Interpretation==\n[[File:Hafez statute at Tehran's Hafez street.jpg|thumb|upright|Hafez's statue in a street with his name in [[Tehran]]]]\nThe question of whether his work is to be interpreted literally, mystically, or both has been a source of contention among western scholars.<ref>Schroeder, Eric, \"The Wild Deer Mathnavi\" in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 11, No. 2, Special Issue on Oriental Art and Aesthetics (December 1952), p.118</ref> On the one hand, some of his early readers such as [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] saw in him a conventional lyricist similar to European love poets such as [[Petrarch]].<ref>[[William Jones (philologist)|Jones, William]] (1772) \"Preface\" in ''Poems, Consisting Chiefly of Translations from the Asiatick Tongues'' p. iv</ref> Others scholars such as [[Henry Wilberforce Clarke]] saw him as purely a poet of didactic, ecstatic [[mysticism]] in the manner of [[Rumi]], a view that a minority of twentieth century critics and literary historians have come to challenge.<ref>Dick Davis: Hafez Faces of Love and the Poets of Shiraz, introduction</ref>\n\nThis confusion stems from the fact that, early in Persian literary history, the poetic vocabulary was usurped by mystics, who believed that the ineffable could be better approached in poetry than in prose. In composing poems of mystic content, they imbued every word and image with mystical undertones, causing mysticism and lyricism to converge into a single tradition. As a result, no fourteenth-century Persian poet could write a [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poem]] without having a flavor of mysticism forced on it by the poetic vocabulary itself.<ref>Thackston, Wheeler: ''A Millennium of Classical Persian Poetry'', Ibex Publishers Inc. 1994, p.&nbsp;ix in \"Introduction\"</ref><ref>Davis, Dick, \"On Not Translating Hafez\" in the ''[[New England Review]]'' 25:1-2 [2004]: 310-18</ref> While some poets, such as [[Ubayd Zakani]], attempted to distance themselves from this fused mystical-lyrical tradition by writing [[satire]]s, Hafez embraced the fusion and thrived on it. [[Wheeler Thackston]] has said of this that Hafez \"sang a rare blend of human and mystic love so balanced... that it is impossible to separate one from the other\".<ref>[[Wheeler Thackston|Thackston, Wheeler]], ''A Millennium of Classical Persian Poetry'', Ibex Publishers Inc.' 1994, p.64</ref> \n\nFor reason such as that, the history of the translation of H\u0101fez is fraught with complications, and few translations into western languages have been wholly successful.\n\nOne of the figurative gestures for which he is most famous (and which is among the most difficult to translate) is ''[[\u012bh\u0101m]]'' or artful [[pun]]ning. Thus, a word such as ''gowhar'', which could mean both \"essence, truth\" and \"pearl,\" would take on ''both'' meanings at once as in a phrase such as \"a pearl/essential truth outside the shell of superficial existence\".\n\nHafez often took advantage of the aforementioned lack of distinction between lyrical, mystical, and [[panegyric]] writing by using highly intellectualized, elaborate [[metaphor]]s and images to suggest multiple possible meanings. For example, a [[couplet]] from one of Hafez's poems reads:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}<!--whose translation? Source?-->\n{{poemquote|Last night, from the cypress branch, the nightingale sang,\nIn Old Persian tones, the lesson of spiritual stations.}}\n\nThe [[cypress]] tree is a symbol both of the beloved and of a regal presence; the [[Common nightingale|nightingale]] and birdsong evoke the traditional setting for human love. The \"lessons of spiritual stations\" suggest, obviously, a mystical undertone as well (though the word for \"spiritual\" could also be translated as \"intrinsically meaningful\"). Therefore, the words could signify at once a prince addressing his devoted followers, a lover courting a beloved, and the reception of spiritual wisdom.<ref>Meisami, Julie Scott (May, 1985). \"Allegorical Gardens in the Persian Poetic Tradition: Nezami, Rumi, Hafez.\" ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' 17(2), 229-260</ref>\n\n== Satire, religion, and politics  ==\n[[File:Hafis-Goethe-Denkmal in Weimar.jpg|thumb|Hafez-Goethe monument in [[Weimar]], Germany]]\nThough Hafez is well known for his poetry, he is less commonly recognized for his intellectual and political contributions.<ref>[http://www.hawzah.net/fa/magazine/magart/3282/4773/39121# Hafez, singing love Mahmood Soree, Golbarg magazine, mehr 1382, number 43]</ref> A defining feature of Hafez' poetry is its [[irony|ironic tone]] and the theme of hypocrisy, widely believed to be a critique of the religious and ruling establishments of the time.<ref name=\"views\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=98s_RXcO2c4C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=Amir+Mobarez+Din+Mohammad&source=bl&ots=cZh_56OsbH&sig=DyDIytnAPRcHbtzGCvlmsFzDtnY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAmoVChMI_aOc_b2hxwIVSWw-Ch2n_A0a#v=onepage&q=hafez&f=false Views from the Edge]</ref><ref name=\"aftabir\">[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/art_culture/literature_verse/c5c1230197619_hafez_p1.php/\u0637\u0646\u0632-\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez humor aftabir.com]</ref> [[Persian satire]] developed during the 14th century, within the courts of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol Period]].

Administratively at state level, it is both a department with a single departmental arrondissement (not to be confused with the 20 city districts of Paris, or ''arrondissements municipaux'', which are local subdivisions existing in very populated municipalities, including Paris, Lyon and Marseille, with their own arrondissement councils and arrondissement mayors also elected during municipal elections), however the prefecture of Paris is split between the prefecture of police of Paris (which covers the 3 other surrounding departments in the first ring) and the department prefecture (which is also the region prefecture, whose competence on police does not cover the 4 departments of Paris and the small ring). As the department of Paris has no department council elected during departmental elections, it is not subdivided into ''cantons'', but its 20 districts are considered equivalent.\n\nThe department councils of the two departments of [[Corsica]] and of the region merged into a unitary authority, officially a ''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale''. Its area of competence covers the whole administrative region and the two administrative departments (which were kept at state level with their two prefectures and their respective subprefectures for state-managed services).\n\nThe overseas departements and regions were all proposed to merge their single departmental council (''conseil d\u00e9partemental'') coexisting with their regional council (''conseil r\u00e9gional'') on the same territory (at state level they are unified as ''DROM'' for their prefectures) into a ''collectivit\u00e9 unique''. The proposal was rejected by local referendum in [[Guadeloupe]] and in [[R\u00e9union]], but this occurred in [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana]] whose former departemental and regional councils were merged into a single unitary authority named ''assembl\u00e9e'', elected during departmental elections. [[Mayotte]] with its newer status of department chose to keep this designation for its unitary authority, named departmental council (no regional council was ever created), but which also has the competence of a regional council (plus a few specific competences transferred from the state like other French overseas).\n\nThe [[M\u00e9tropole de Lyon]] was created as a metropole from an earlier EPCI (public establishment of intercommunal cooperation) but gained the competences of the departmental council. The departmental council of Rh\u00f4ne only covers the rest of the administrative department (which is still subdivided into two subprefectures, one of which includes the m\u00e9tropole). So the metropole is not an unitary authority, and no longer an EPCI (like other French metropoles), but it has a specific status, considered equivalent to a department council, except that its seats are elected during the municipal French elections (at the same time as its municipal councils in each member ''commune''), and that (like departments and regions, but unlike other French EPCI's including other metropoles) it is a territorial collectivity, with legal personality and fiscal autonomy.\n\n==New Zealand==\nIn [[local government in New Zealand|New Zealand]], a unitary authority is a [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] (district or city) that also performs the functions of a [[Regions of New Zealand|regional council]] (first-level division). There are five unitary authorities; they are (with the year they were constituted): [[Gisborne District Council]] (1989), [[Nelson City Council]] (1992), [[Tasman District Council]] (1992), [[Marlborough District Council]] (1992), and [[Auckland Council]] (2010).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/info-about-2013-census-data/2013-census-definitions-forms/definitions/u.aspx |title=2013 Census definitions and forms: U |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.localcouncils.govt.nz/lgip.nsf/wpgurl/Resources-Glossary-Index |title=Glossary |work= localcouncils.govt.nz |publisher= Department of Internal Affairs |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Chatham Islands]], located east of the [[South Island]], have a council with its own special legislation, constituted (1995) with powers similar to those of a regional authority.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 No 41 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act Contents \u2013 New Zealand Legislation|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0041/latest/DLM367666.html|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=5 February 2017|language=en-NZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Minutes of the Statutory Meeting of the Chatham Islands Council |publisher=[[Chatham Islands]] Council |url=http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/councilMeetings/cic-council-statutory-minutes-281010.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205012614/http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/councilMeetings/cic-council-statutory-minutes-281010.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2011 |date=October 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Poland==\n{{main|City with powiat rights}}\nIn [[Poland]], a ''miasto na prawach powiatu'', or shortly ''powiat grodzki'' (''city with [[powiat]] rights'', or ''urban county'' in short) is a, typically big, city which is also responsible for district (poviat) administrative level, being part of no other ''powiat'' (e.g. [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Pozna\u0144]]).

Until 1996 two-tier systems existed in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], but these have now been replaced by systems based on a single-tier of local government with some functions shared between groups of adjacent authorities. A single-tier system has existed in [[Northern Ireland]] since 1973.\n\nFor many years the description of the number of tiers in UK local government arrangements has routinely ignored any current or previous bodies at the lowest level of authorities elected by the voters within their area such as parish (in England and Wales) or community councils; such bodies do not exist or have not existed in all areas.\n\n===Rest of the United Kingdom===\nThe definitive description \"unitary authority\" is specific to England alone in UK legislation.

In some areas, the reverse is true; for example, [[Howard County, Maryland]] and [[Arlington County, Virginia]] are examples of counties that, despite being densely developed, have no municipalities and are thus the only tier of general-purpose local government. \n\nIn Virginia, all municipalities with ''city'' status are, by definition, independent from any county.  Three other cities across the United States are also [[Independent city (United States)|independent of any county government]]: [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Carson City, Nevada]].  There are also several [[consolidated city-county|consolidated cities]] where the county government and municipal government are unified.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure.

The disaster was caused by low-temperature impairment of an O-ring, a mission critical seal used between segments of the SRB casing. Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of events which caused the orbiter to disintegrate.<ref name=challenger_report_ch3>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch3.htm |title= Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter III: The Accident |publisher=NASA |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 14, 2020}}</ref> Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53&nbsp;\u00b0F (12&nbsp;\u00b0C) had been ignored by NASA managers.<ref name=challenger_report_ch6>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |publisher=Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' disintegrated during re-entry, killing its crew of seven, because of damage to the [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon]] leading edge of the wing caused during launch.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]].
