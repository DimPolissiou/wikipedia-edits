It also made an appearance in the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' television series as well as the 1976 CBS Saturday morning children's live action TV show ''[[Ark II]]''.\n\n== History ==\nWendell F. Moore began working on a rocket pack as early as 1953 (possibly, after learning about Thomas Moore's work) while working as an engineer at [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerosystems]]. Experiments began in the mid-1950s. Developing the engine did not present difficulties &mdash; the application of hydrogen peroxide was well developed by [[missile]]men. The main problem was achieving stable and steady flight; for this, a reliable and convenient control system had to be developed.\n\nIn 1959 the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] contracted [[Aerojet|Aerojet General]] to conduct feasibility studies on a Rocket Belt and contracted [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerosystems]] to develop a Small Rocket Lift Device (SRLD). The experimental rig, which worked on compressed nitrogen, was prepared. Its steel tubing frame allowed a tester to be attached to the rig. Two hinged nozzles were set on the frame. Nitrogen at 35 atmospheres (3.5 MPa) was supplied to the nozzles by flexible hoses. An engineer-operator on the ground regulated the supply of nitrogen through a valve. Additionally, the tester regulated the thrust using levers under his shoulders. The tester inclined the nozzles forward and backward, trying to reach stable hovering at a limited height. A safety tether was attached from below, so that the rig and tester could not fly too high.\n\n===Testing===\nThe first tests showed that the human body was a very unstable platform. Testing found the best arrangement for the jet nozzles relative to the center of gravity of both the pilot and pack that allowed for directional control. Wendell Moore and other members of his group participated in the test flights. These first flights were just sharp leaps, but proved the concept and persuaded the military to fund development. The Bell company was awarded a contract to develop, flight test, and demonstrate a practical SRLD.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nA rocket motor with a thrust of 280 [[Pound-force|pounds-force]] (1.25 [[Newton (unit)|kN]] or 127 [[kilogram-force|kgf]]) was chosen. The pack with its fuel weighed 125&nbsp;lb (57&nbsp;kg). The pack had a [[fiberglass]] frame contoured to fit the operator's body, secured with straps, and cylinders of fuel and nitrogen were attached to the frame. The motor was fastened using a hinged assembly that was controlled by levers under the shoulders while thrust was controlled through a regulator assembly connected to a throttle handle on the right lever of the device. The handle on the left lever governed the slant of the (jetavators) nozzles. Tests of the pack began toward the end of 1960 and were performed in a large hangar with a safety tether. Wendell Moore completed the first 20 tethered takeoffs while making incremental improvements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nOn 17 February 1961, the pack veered sharply, reaching the end of the safety tether, which then broke, causing Moore to fall approximately 2.5 meters, breaking his [[kneecap]] and rendering him unfit for further flights. Engineer Harold Graham took over as [[test pilot]] and testing resumed on 1 March. He then carried out 36 more tethered tests which enabled them to achieve stable control of the pack. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nOn 20 April 1961 (the week after [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight), on a vacant spot near the [[Niagara Falls]] airport, the first free flight of a rocket pack was performed. Harold Graham reached a height of approximately 4 feet (1.2 meters), and then flew smoothly forward at a speed of approximately 10&nbsp;km/h for a distance of 108 feet (less than 35 meters) and then landed. The flight lasted 13 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn subsequent flights Graham learned how to control the pack and perform more complex maneuvers: flying in a circle and turning on a spot. He flew over streams and cars, ten-meter hills, and between trees. From April through May 1961 Graham carried out 28 additional flights. Wendell Moore worked to achieve reliability from the pack and confident piloting from Graham in preparation of presenting the rocket pack to the public. In the course of testing, maximums of duration and distance were achieved: duration 21 seconds; range 120 m; height 10 m; speed, 55&nbsp;km/h.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Demonstrations===\nOn 8 June 1962, the pack was publicly demonstrated for the first time before several hundred officers at the [[Fort Eustis]] military base. Other public demonstrations then followed, including the famous flight in [[the Pentagon]] courtyard.  On that day Harold Graham flew before 3000 members of the military department, who observed with enthusiasm.\n\nOn 11 October 1961, (according to other data, 12 October) the pack was demonstrated personally to President [[John F. Kennedy]] in the course of experimental maneuvers on the military base Fort Bragg. Graham took off from an amphibious [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]], flew over a strip of water, and landed in front of the President.\n\nHarold Graham and a support crew travelled to many cities in the USA. They visited Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Germany, and France, as well as other countries. Each time they successfully demonstrated the rocket pack in action before the public. However, the army was disappointed. The maximum duration of flight of the rocket pack was 21 seconds, with a range of only 120 m. A large contingent of service personnel needed to accompany the rocket pack. During flight 5 U.S. gallons (19 liters) of [[hydrogen peroxide]] was expended. In the opinion of the military, the \"Bell Rocket Belt\" was more a spectacular toy than an effective means of transport. The army spent $150,000 on the Bell Aerosystems contract. Bell spent an additional $50,000. The army refused any further expenditure on the SRLD program, and the contract was cancelled.\n\n==Design==\nThe rocket could carry a man over 9-m-high obstacles and reached a speed of 11 to 16&nbsp;km/h. However, its flying time was limited to 20 seconds. A later advancement during the years 1995-2000 could not improve the flying time to any more than 30 seconds.\n\nApart from the extremely limited working time, this rocket belt did not allow for a controlled landing should its drive fail, as it would operate at altitudes far too low for a [[parachute]] to function.  This represents a substantial safety risk and differentiates the rocket belt from [[airplane]]s and [[helicopter]]s, which can land safely without power by gliding or [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]].\n\n===Operating principle===\n[[File:Rocket Belt general view.png|thumb|USA patent No 3243144, 1966 rocket pack \"Bell Rocket Belt\"]]\nAll existing rocket packs are based on the construction of the \"Bell Rocket Belt\" pack, developed in 1960-1969 by Wendell Moore.\n\nMoore's pack has two major parts:\n* Rigid glass-plastic corset (8), strapped to the pilot (10). The corset has a tubular metallic frame on the back, on which are fixed three [[gas cylinder]]s: two with liquid hydrogen peroxide (6), and one with compressed nitrogen (7). When the pilot is on the ground, the corset distributes the weight of the pack to the pilot's back.\n* The rocket engine, able to move on a ball and socket joint (9) in the upper part of the corset. The rocket engine consists of a gas generator (1) and two pipes (2) rigidly connected with it, which end with jet nozzles with controlled tips (3). The engine is rigidly connected to two levers, which are passed under the pilot's hands. Using these levers the pilot inclines the engine forward or back and to the sides. On the right lever is the thrust control throttle (5), connected via a cable to the regulator valve (4) to supply fuel to the engine. On the left lever is the steering handle, which moves the tips of the jet nozzles, allowing the pilot to control his yaw.\n\n[[File:Rocket Belt Propulsion.svg|thumb|right|Operating principle of rocket engine]]\nThe whole construction is simple and reliable; except for the regulator valve and steerable nozzles, the rocket engine has no moving parts.\n* The figure at right shows the engine, hydrogen peroxide cylinders and compressed nitrogen cylinder (pressure c. 40 atm or 4 MPa).\n* The pilot turns the engine thrust control handle, opening the regulator valve (3).\n* Compressed nitrogen (1) displaces liquid hydrogen peroxide (2), which is piped to the gas generator (4).\n* There it contacts the catalyst (thin [[silver]] plates, covered with a layer of [[samarium]] [[nitrate]]) and decomposes.\n* The resulting hot high-pressure mixture of steam and oxygen gas enters two pipes, which emerge from the gas generator.\n* These pipes are covered with a layer of insulation to reduce heat loss.\n* Then the hot gases enter the jet nozzles ([[De Laval nozzle]]s), where they are first constricted, then allowed to expand, thereby accelerating them to [[supersonic]] speed and creating reactive thrust.\n\n===Piloting===\nThe pack has two levers, rigidly connected to the engine installation. Pressing on these levers, the pilot deflects the nozzles back, and the pack flies forward. Accordingly, raising this lever makes the pack move back. It is possible to lean the engine installation to the sides (because of the ball and socket joint) to fly sideways.\n\nControl with the aid of the lever is somewhat rough; for finer control the pilot uses a handle on the left lever. This handle governs the tips of the jet nozzles. The tips (jetavators) are spring-opposed and can, with the aid of the flexible thrusts, be slanted forward or back. The pilot inclines the handle forward or back and slants both nozzle tips at the same time to fly [[Line (geometry)|straight]]. If pilot must turn, he turns handle, to slant the nozzles in opposite directions, one forward, another back, turning the pilot and the pack around its axis. By the combination of different motions of lever handles the pilot can fly any way, even sideways, to turn, rotate on the spot, etc.\n\nThe pilot can control his rocket pack's flight differently, by changing the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]] of his body. For example, if we bend the legs and raise them to the stomach, the center of gravity will move forwards, and pack will be inclined and it will also fly forward. Such a control of pack, with the aid of the body, is considered incorrect and is characteristic of novices. Most experienced pilot [[Bill Suitor]] asserts that during the flight it is necessary to hold legs together and straight, and to control flight by the pack's levers and handles. This is the only way to learn to competently pilot the pack and to confidently carry out complex aerial maneuvers.\n\nThe throttle handle is on the right lever. In the closed position it completely shuts the fuel regulator valve, stopping fuel from reaching the engine. Turning the handle counterclockwise, the pilot increases the engine thrust. During servicing of the pack with compressed nitrogen the handle is held in the closed position with a [[shear pin]] for safety. The pilot's timer is on the same handle. Since the pack has fuel for only for 21 seconds of flight, it is critical to know when the pack will run out of fuel, so that the pilot can safely land before his tanks are empty.\n\nBefore the flight the timer is set for 21 seconds. When the pilot turns the handle for the takeoff, the timer begins counting and will give second-by-second signals to a buzzer in the pilot's helmet. In 15 seconds the signal becomes continuous, telling the pilot that it is time to land.\n\n===Special features of flights of the Bell Rocket Belt===\n<!-- ([[:ru:\u0418\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435:Rocket Belt Condensation.jpg|IMAGE:]] The first flight of the pack was on 20 April 1961, air temperature 4degC, air humidity 80%. Harold Graham is wrapped in clouds of condensed vapor.) -->\n\nThe pack's pilot wears protective overalls made of thermal resistant material, since the exhaust jet and the engine's pipes are very hot. He also wears a crash helmet containing hearing protection and the buzzer for the low-fuel warning timer. The rocket thrust-chamber's supersonic exhaust jet makes a deafeningly loud (130 [[decibel]]s), shrill screeching sound, very different from the roar of an airplane's jet engine.\n\nThe jet exhaust is transparent and usually not visible in air. But in cold weather the water vapor, which is a large part of the steam-gas mixture, condenses soon after it leaves the nozzle, enveloping the pilot in a cloud of fog (for this reason, the very first tethered flights of the Bell Rocket Belt were carried out in a hangar). The jet exhaust is also visible if the fuel is not decomposed completely in the gas generator, which can occur if the [[Catalysis|catalyst]] or the hydrogen peroxide is contaminated.\n\n==RB2000 Rocket Belt== <!-- do not change - linked from [[Jet_pack]] -->\nIn 1992 a company was formed by Brad Barker (a former insurance salesman), Joe Wright (a Houston-based businessman), and Larry Stanley (an [[engineer]] and owner of an [[oil well]]), after inviting professional inventor [[Doug Malewicki]], with the goal of developing a new version of the rocket pack.  By 1994 they had a working prototype, which they named \"RB 2000 Rocket Belt\". The \"RB 2000\" essentially reimplemented Wendell Moore's design using light alloys ([[titanium]], [[aluminium]]) and [[composite material]]s.  It featured increased fuel stock and increased power, and the maximum duration of flight was increased to 30 seconds.  It was flown on 12 June 1995 by Bill Suitor.<ref name=NS>New Scientist (October 2005), issue 2519.</ref>\n\nThe partnership broke down soon thereafter, with Stanley accusing Barker of fraud and Barker taking the RB-2000 to an unknown location.  A year later Stanley successfully sued Barker, who was ordered to return the RB-2000 to Stanley and pay 10 million dollars in costs and damages. When Barker refused to deliver, Stanley kidnapped him and held him captive in a box, from which Barker managed to escape after eight days. Stanley was arrested in 2002 for the kidnapping, and served an eight years sentence. The rocketbelt was never recovered.<ref name=NS/> The story is recounted in the book ''The Rocketbelt Caper: A True Tale of Invention, Obsession and Murder'' ({{ISBN|0955218373}}) by Paul Brown, and fictionalized in the 2008 movie ''[[Pretty Bird]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|'''Technical characteristics of rocket pack'''\n|-\n| \n| '''Bell Rocket Belt'''\n| '''RB 2000 Rocket Belt'''\n|-\n| Duration \n|21 s\n|30 s\n|-\n| Thrust \n| 136 kgf (1.33&nbsp;kN) <br />(calculated 127 kgf or 1.25&nbsp;kN)\n| 145 kgf (1.42&nbsp;kN)\n|-\n| Maximum distance\n|colspan=\"2\"| approximately 250 meters or 820 feet\n|-\n| Maximum altitude\n| 18 m (~59 feet)\n| 30 m (~98 feet)\n|-\n| Maximum speed\n| 55&nbsp;km/h or 34&nbsp;mph\n| 96&nbsp;km/h or 60&nbsp;mph\n|-\n| Equipped mass\n| 57&nbsp;kg or 125&nbsp;lbs\n| 60&nbsp;kg or 132&nbsp;lbs\n|- \n| Fuel stock\n| 19 liters or 5 gallons\n| 23 liters or 6 gallons\n|}\n\n==Books==\nIn 1993 a book was published by Derwin M.

On the left lever is the steering handle, which moves the tips of the jet nozzles, allowing the pilot to control his yaw.\n\n[[File:Rocket Belt Propulsion.svg|thumb|right|Operating principle of rocket engine]]\nThe whole construction is simple and reliable; except for the regulator valve and steerable nozzles, the rocket engine has no moving parts.\n* The figure at right shows the engine, hydrogen peroxide cylinders and compressed nitrogen cylinder (pressure c. 40 atm or 4 MPa).\n* The pilot turns the engine thrust control handle, opening the regulator valve (3).\n* Compressed nitrogen (1) displaces liquid hydrogen peroxide (2), which is piped to the gas generator (4).\n* There it contacts the catalyst (thin [[silver]] plates, covered with a layer of [[samarium]] [[nitrate]]) and decomposes.\n* The resulting hot high-pressure mixture of steam and oxygen gas enters two pipes, which emerge from the gas generator.\n* These pipes are covered with a layer of insulation to reduce heat loss.\n* Then the hot gases enter the jet nozzles ([[De Laval nozzle]]s), where they are first constricted, then allowed to expand, thereby accelerating them to [[supersonic]] speed and creating reactive thrust.\n\n===Piloting===\nThe pack has two levers, rigidly connected to the engine installation. Pressing on these levers, the pilot deflects the nozzles back, and the pack flies forward. Accordingly, raising this lever makes the pack move back. It is possible to lean the engine installation to the sides (because of the ball and socket joint) to fly sideways.\n\nControl with the aid of the lever is somewhat rough; for finer control the pilot uses a handle on the left lever. This handle governs the tips of the jet nozzles. The tips (jetavators) are spring-opposed and can, with the aid of the flexible thrusts, be slanted forward or back. The pilot inclines the handle forward or back and slants both nozzle tips at the same time to fly [[Line (geometry)|straight]]. If pilot must turn, he turns handle, to slant the nozzles in opposite directions, one forward, another back, turning the pilot and the pack around its axis. By the combination of different motions of lever handles the pilot can fly any way, even sideways, to turn, rotate on the spot, etc.\n\nThe pilot can control his rocket pack's flight differently, by changing the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]] of his body. For example, if we bend the legs and raise them to the stomach, the center of gravity will move forwards, and pack will be inclined and it will also fly forward. Such a control of pack, with the aid of the body, is considered incorrect and is characteristic of novices. Most experienced pilot [[Bill Suitor]] asserts that during the flight it is necessary to hold legs together and straight, and to control flight by the pack's levers and handles. This is the only way to learn to competently pilot the pack and to confidently carry out complex aerial maneuvers.\n\nThe throttle handle is on the right lever. In the closed position it completely shuts the fuel regulator valve, stopping fuel from reaching the engine. Turning the handle counterclockwise, the pilot increases the engine thrust. During servicing of the pack with compressed nitrogen the handle is held in the closed position with a [[shear pin]] for safety. The pilot's timer is on the same handle. Since the pack has fuel for only for 21 seconds of flight, it is critical to know when the pack will run out of fuel, so that the pilot can safely land before his tanks are empty.\n\nBefore the flight the timer is set for 21 seconds. When the pilot turns the handle for the takeoff, the timer begins counting and will give second-by-second signals to a buzzer in the pilot's helmet. In 15 seconds the signal becomes continuous, telling the pilot that it is time to land.\n\n===Special features of flights of the Bell Rocket Belt===\n<!-- ([[:ru:\u0418\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435:Rocket Belt Condensation.jpg|IMAGE:]] The first flight of the pack was on 20 April 1961, air temperature 4degC, air humidity 80%. Harold Graham is wrapped in clouds of condensed vapor.) -->\n\nThe pack's pilot wears protective overalls made of thermal resistant material, since the exhaust jet and the engine's pipes are very hot. He also wears a crash helmet containing hearing protection and the buzzer for the low-fuel warning timer. The rocket thrust-chamber's supersonic exhaust jet makes a deafeningly loud (130 [[decibel]]s), shrill screeching sound, very different from the roar of an airplane's jet engine.\n\nThe jet exhaust is transparent and usually not visible in air. But in cold weather the water vapor, which is a large part of the steam-gas mixture, condenses soon after it leaves the nozzle, enveloping the pilot in a cloud of fog (for this reason, the very first tethered flights of the Bell Rocket Belt were carried out in a hangar). The jet exhaust is also visible if the fuel is not decomposed completely in the gas generator, which can occur if the [[Catalysis|catalyst]] or the hydrogen peroxide is contaminated.\n\n==RB2000 Rocket Belt== <!-- do not change - linked from [[Jet_pack]] -->\nIn 1992 a company was formed by Brad Barker (a former insurance salesman), Joe Wright (a Houston-based businessman), and Larry Stanley (an [[engineer]] and owner of an [[oil well]]), after inviting professional inventor [[Doug Malewicki]], with the goal of developing a new version of the rocket pack.  By 1994 they had a working prototype, which they named \"RB 2000 Rocket Belt\". The \"RB 2000\" essentially reimplemented Wendell Moore's design using light alloys ([[titanium]], [[aluminium]]) and [[composite material]]s.  It featured increased fuel stock and increased power, and the maximum duration of flight was increased to 30 seconds.  It was flown on 12 June 1995 by Bill Suitor.<ref name=NS>New Scientist (October 2005), issue 2519.</ref>\n\nThe partnership broke down soon thereafter, with Stanley accusing Barker of fraud and Barker taking the RB-2000 to an unknown location.  A year later Stanley successfully sued Barker, who was ordered to return the RB-2000 to Stanley and pay 10 million dollars in costs and damages. When Barker refused to deliver, Stanley kidnapped him and held him captive in a box, from which Barker managed to escape after eight days. Stanley was arrested in 2002 for the kidnapping, and served an eight years sentence. The rocketbelt was never recovered.<ref name=NS/> The story is recounted in the book ''The Rocketbelt Caper: A True Tale of Invention, Obsession and Murder'' ({{ISBN|0955218373}}) by Paul Brown, and fictionalized in the 2008 movie ''[[Pretty Bird]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|'''Technical characteristics of rocket pack'''\n|-\n| \n| '''Bell Rocket Belt'''\n| '''RB 2000 Rocket Belt'''\n|-\n| Duration \n|21 s\n|30 s\n|-\n| Thrust \n| 136 kgf (1.33&nbsp;kN) <br />(calculated 127 kgf or 1.25&nbsp;kN)\n| 145 kgf (1.42&nbsp;kN)\n|-\n| Maximum distance\n|colspan=\"2\"| approximately 250 meters or 820 feet\n|-\n| Maximum altitude\n| 18 m (~59 feet)\n| 30 m (~98 feet)\n|-\n| Maximum speed\n| 55&nbsp;km/h or 34&nbsp;mph\n| 96&nbsp;km/h or 60&nbsp;mph\n|-\n| Equipped mass\n| 57&nbsp;kg or 125&nbsp;lbs\n| 60&nbsp;kg or 132&nbsp;lbs\n|- \n| Fuel stock\n| 19 liters or 5 gallons\n| 23 liters or 6 gallons\n|}\n\n==Books==\nIn 1993 a book was published by Derwin M.

A semi-final [[Coppa Italia]] knockout at the hands of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] followed by a quarter-final [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] knockout at the hands of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] left Milan fighting on only one front towards the end of the season\u2014the [[Scudetto]]. Even that was to be lost, however, with the ''Rossoneri'' finishing in second place to Juventus and therefore qualifying for [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League|next season's Champions League group stage]]. The season was also marked with controversy however, as in the second half of the season, Milan had a goal by [[Sulley Muntari]] disallowed in a key match against title rivals Juventus at the [[San Siro]], after they had already been leading 1\u20130; the match eventually ended in a 1\u20131 draw.<ref name=relationship/> Along with [[Adriano Galliani]], Allegri drew criticism for his decision to sell veteran deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo to Juventus, after excluding him from the starting eleven the previous season, and deeming him to be a surplus due to his age; Pirlo went on to play a key role in Juventus's victorious Serie A title.<ref name=relationship/>\n\nOn 13 January 2012, Allegri agreed to extend his contract with Milan to the end of 2013\u201314 season. On 5 June 2012, Allegri stated that he intends to coach for only 10 more years and plans to retire at the age of 55 due to the fact that coaching contains a high level of stress and anxiety. He also said that he hopes to coach the Italian national side before he retires. With the departure and retirement of several of the club's key players, Milan struggled at the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season, and had only collected 8 points from their first 7 games, putting Allegri in danger of getting fired early on.<ref name=relationship/> Despite all the criticism from the critics, Milan stuck with Allegri and he managed to get the best out of some younger players including [[Stephan El Shaarawy]], Milan's home-grown player [[Mattia De Sciglio]] and later on [[Mario Balotelli]]. Allegri managed to steer the Rossoneri from 16th place to a 3rd-place finish at the end of the season, with an epic 2\u20131 comeback victory away to [[A.C. Siena|Siena]]. The result gave Milan a spot in the playoff round for the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League|2013\u201314 Champions League]] campaign.<ref name=relationship/>\n\nOn 1 June 2013, club president [[Silvio Berlusconi]] confirmed Allegri to remain as the manager of Milan, despite numerous speculations that he would be given the sack. On 31 December 2013, Allegri confirmed he would leave the club at the end of the season, telling ''Gazzetta dello Sport'': \"Of course this is my last Christmas at A.C. Milan\".

Under Allegri, Juventus became slightly less aggressive and intense in their pressing off the ball while their playing style became more patient and focussed on keeping possession and gaining territorial advantage in order to conserve energy, tactics which he had previously used while at Milan. Although Allegri's team was still effective at winning the ball in midfield and scoring from counter-attacks, the club's attacking play on the ball usually involved a slower build-up, which mainly consisted of short passes, and fewer long balls from [[Andrea Pirlo|Pirlo]] and [[Leonardo Bonucci|Bonucci]].<ref name=stamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/60374/allegri%E2%80%99s-stamp-bianconeri|title=Allegri\u2019s stamp on the Bianconeri|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Luca Cetta|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=imagination>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/54899/%E2%80%98more-imagination-allegri%E2%80%99|title=More imagination with Allegri|publisher=Football Italia|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/news/show/144150|title=THE NUMBERS GAME|publisher=A.C.

The switch to a four-man back-line also allowed Allegri to rotate several players, such as centre-backs [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Andrea Barzagli]] and Leonardo Bonucci as well as right-backs [[Dani Alves]] and [[Stephan Lichtsteiner]], while centre-forward Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 was deployed in a deeper, wider role as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or attacking midfielder on the left flank\u2014this new position utilised the Croatian's work-rate, intelligence, hold-up play and ability to cover for teammates making overlapping runs, in particular those of left-back [[Alex Sandro]] while Mand\u017euki\u0107's height and ability in the air also enabled him to function essentially as a \"[[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|target man]]\" in wider areas.\n\nJuventus's tactical versatility was demonstrated by their ability to switch between the 3\u20135\u20132 and 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formations during matches; this trait was particularly evident in the team's first leg fixture of the Champions League semi-final against [[A.S. Monaco|Monaco]]. Ahead of the match, Allegri fielded Dani Alves as a right-sided wing-back in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation in lieu of Cuadrado and reverted to the team's trademark back-three composed of Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini. When in possession, Juventus kept the ball and played it out from the back and usually attacked with a [[Formation (association football)#3\u20136\u20131|3\u20132\u20134\u20131]], [[Formation (association football)#3\u20134\u20133|3\u20134\u20133]] or 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation as Dani Alves often made offensive overlapping runs behind the opposition's defence, essentially acting as a winger, which created difficulties for Monaco's back-line while Barzagli moved out wide to cover for the Brazilian, functioning as a makeshift right-back. When defending behind the ball, the team reverted to an organised 3\u20135\u20132 or [[Formation (association football)#5\u20133\u20132|5\u20133\u20132 formation]], which was difficult for Monaco to break down, courtesy of the strength of Juventus's defensive trio, who were dubbed \"the [[BBC (disambiguation)|BBC]]\" in the media, a reference to the defenders' initials\u2014Juventus's defensive solidity ensured that the club only conceded three goals en route to the 2017 Champions League final and also allowed the Turin side to create goalscoring opportunities from swift, sudden and efficient counter-attacks after winning back possession. Juventus ended the season by capturing their third consecutive domestic double, which included an unprecedented Italian record sixth consecutive league title; and also reached the Champions League final for the second time in three years, losing out 4\u20131 to defending champions Real Madrid.<ref name=\"Galatasaray go for Mandzukic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/99125/galatasaray-go-mandzukic|title=Galatasaray go for Mandzukic|publisher=Football Italia|date=2 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/97325/audacious-juve-new-norm|title=Audacious Juve the new norm|publisher=Football Italia| first = Nick | last = Valerio|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/95794/west-ham-want-mandzukic-zaza|title=West Ham want Mandzukic for Zaza|publisher=Football Italia|date=17 December 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/10659388/who-could-tottenham-hotspur-target-in-january|title=Who could Tottenham Hotspur target in January?|publisher=Sky Sports|date=6 November 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Mandzukic proving worth to Juventus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/club/juventus/111/blog/post/3013358/mario-mandzukic-proving-worth-to-juventus-and-max-allegri-yet-again|title=Mario Mandzukic proving worth to Juventus and Max Allegri yet again|publisher=ESPN FC|first = Mina | last = Rzouki |date=6 December 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/97804/juventus-cant-forget-3-5-2|title=Juventus can't forget 3\u20135\u20132|publisher=Football Italia| first = Gaby | last = McKay|date=2 February 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acmilan.com/en/news/first-team/2017-03-08/opponents-under-the-microscope-juventus|title= OPPONENTS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: JUVENTUS |publisher=A.C.

After beginning his managerial career in 2003 with several smaller Italian sides, he later played a key role in [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]]'s rise through the lower Italian divisions and subsequently led [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] to their best Serie A finish in nearly 15 years, winning the [[Panchina d'Oro]] Award for best Serie A coach in [[2008\u201309 Serie A|2009]]. His performances as head coach of Cagliari earned him a move to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in 2010, where he remained until January 2014; in the [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]], Allegri helped Milan to their first Serie A title since the 2003\u201304 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/05/07/milan.serie.a.champions/index.html|title=Milan crowned Serie A champions after Roma draw|work=[[CNN News]]|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter joining Juventus in 2014, he won four consecutive domestic [[Double (association football)|doubles]] between 2015 and 2018, the only coach to achieve this feat in the top 5 European leagues.\n\n== Club career ==\nAfter spending the earlier part of his career in the lower leagues, including his hometown club [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], Allegri joined [[Pescara Calcio|Pescara]] in 1991. A talented and creative player, he established himself in midfield as [[Giovanni Galeone]]'s side won promotion to [[Serie A]] in 1992. Allegri was an outstanding performer for Pescara in Serie A. Despite the side's relegation in last place, there was no shortage of goals and Allegri scored an impressive 12 goals from midfield. He moved on to [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and then [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] before returning to Pescara. Brief spells at [[A.C.

Following an impressive season with them, Allegri was called to head [[U.S. Grosseto F.C.|Grosseto]], then in [[Serie C1]], but his experience with the ''biancazzurri'' proved not to be as successful as with Aglianese and he was ultimately sacked shortly after the beginning of the 2006\u201307 Serie C1 season.

A semi-final [[Coppa Italia]] knockout at the hands of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] followed by a quarter-final [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] knockout at the hands of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] left Milan fighting on only one front towards the end of the season\u2014the [[Scudetto]]. Even that was to be lost, however, with the ''Rossoneri'' finishing in second place to Juventus and therefore qualifying for [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League|next season's Champions League group stage]]. The season was also marked with controversy however, as in the second half of the season, Milan had a goal by [[Sulley Muntari]] disallowed in a key match against title rivals Juventus at the [[San Siro]], after they had already been leading 1\u20130; the match eventually ended in a 1\u20131 draw.<ref name=relationship/> Along with [[Adriano Galliani]], Allegri drew criticism for his decision to sell veteran deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo to Juventus, after excluding him from the starting eleven the previous season, and deeming him to be a surplus due to his age; Pirlo went on to play a key role in Juventus's victorious Serie A title.<ref name=relationship/>\n\nOn 13 January 2012, Allegri agreed to extend his contract with Milan to the end of 2013\u201314 season. On 5 June 2012, Allegri stated that he intends to coach for only 10 more years and plans to retire at the age of 55 due to the fact that coaching contains a high level of stress and anxiety. He also said that he hopes to coach the Italian national side before he retires. With the departure and retirement of several of the club's key players, Milan struggled at the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season, and had only collected 8 points from their first 7 games, putting Allegri in danger of getting fired early on.<ref name=relationship/> Despite all the criticism from the critics, Milan stuck with Allegri and he managed to get the best out of some younger players including [[Stephan El Shaarawy]], Milan's home-grown player [[Mattia De Sciglio]] and later on [[Mario Balotelli]]. Allegri managed to steer the Rossoneri from 16th place to a 3rd-place finish at the end of the season, with an epic 2\u20131 comeback victory away to [[A.C. Siena|Siena]].

management ==\nAllegri has been praised for his tactical intelligence and his ability to build effectively upon [[Antonio Conte]]'s successful tactics and winning mentality as Juventus's manager, albeit in a less rigorous manner. He initially continued to use Conte's trademark [[Formation (association football)#3\u20135\u20132|3\u20135\u20132 formation]], but later switched to a four-man back-line, in particular in the UEFA Champions League. Under Allegri, Juventus became slightly less aggressive and intense in their pressing off the ball while their playing style became more patient and focussed on keeping possession and gaining territorial advantage in order to conserve energy, tactics which he had previously used while at Milan. Although Allegri's team was still effective at winning the ball in midfield and scoring from counter-attacks, the club's attacking play on the ball usually involved a slower build-up, which mainly consisted of short passes, and fewer long balls from [[Andrea Pirlo|Pirlo]] and [[Leonardo Bonucci|Bonucci]].<ref name=stamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/60374/allegri%E2%80%99s-stamp-bianconeri|title=Allegri\u2019s stamp on the Bianconeri|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Luca Cetta|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=imagination>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/54899/%E2%80%98more-imagination-allegri%E2%80%99|title=More imagination with Allegri|publisher=Football Italia|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/news/show/144150|title=THE NUMBERS GAME|publisher=A.C.

The switch to a four-man back-line also allowed Allegri to rotate several players, such as centre-backs [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Andrea Barzagli]] and Leonardo Bonucci as well as right-backs [[Dani Alves]] and [[Stephan Lichtsteiner]], while centre-forward Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 was deployed in a deeper, wider role as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or attacking midfielder on the left flank\u2014this new position utilised the Croatian's work-rate, intelligence, hold-up play and ability to cover for teammates making overlapping runs, in particular those of left-back [[Alex Sandro]] while Mand\u017euki\u0107's height and ability in the air also enabled him to function essentially as a \"[[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|target man]]\" in wider areas.\n\nJuventus's tactical versatility was demonstrated by their ability to switch between the 3\u20135\u20132 and 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formations during matches; this trait was particularly evident in the team's first leg fixture of the Champions League semi-final against [[A.S. Monaco|Monaco]]. Ahead of the match, Allegri fielded Dani Alves as a right-sided wing-back in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation in lieu of Cuadrado and reverted to the team's trademark back-three composed of Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini. When in possession, Juventus kept the ball and played it out from the back and usually attacked with a [[Formation (association football)#3\u20136\u20131|3\u20132\u20134\u20131]], [[Formation (association football)#3\u20134\u20133|3\u20134\u20133]] or 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation as Dani Alves often made offensive overlapping runs behind the opposition's defence, essentially acting as a winger, which created difficulties for Monaco's back-line while Barzagli moved out wide to cover for the Brazilian, functioning as a makeshift right-back.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Buug was derived from the word '<nowiki/>''bog'<nowiki/>'', a [[Subanon language|Subanen]] word for [[secondary forest]] which is the same as the Cebuano-Visayan term '<nowiki/>''buog'<nowiki/>''. Accordingly, a group of Subanens stumbled upon this '<nowiki/>''bog''' that was endowed with a stream and sufficient supply of water while they were moving from one place to another in search of a safe place to start a living away from marauders who were in search for slaves and things to loot. From then on people began to refer to the ''bog'' as Buug.\n\n==Geography==\n\nBuug is located in the central [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], on the island of [[Mindanao]]. It has a pentagon-like shape bounded on the south by [[Dumanquilas Bay]], [[Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur|Bayog]] on the north, [[Kumalarang, Zamboanga del Sur|Kumalarang]] on the east, [[Diplahan, Zamboanga Sibugay|Diplahan]] on the west, and [[Malangas, Zamboanga Sibugay|Malangas]] on south-west. The distance from [[Manila]] to Buug is approximately {{Convert|790|km}}. It is five hours away from [[Zamboanga City]] by bus, one hour and 45 minutes bus drive from the [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]], and {{Convert|57|km}} away from [[Pagadian]], or 45 minutes of travel by bus.\n\nIt has an average temperature of {{Convert|26|C}} and has an average elevation of {{Convert|200|m}} above sea level. It is away from the typhoon belt and enjoying a [[Climate of the Philippines|Type IV climate]], i.e. rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n===Barangays===\n\nBuug belongs to the first district of [[Zamboanga Sibugay]]. The local executive council is administered by a mayor. The legislative council is headed by a vice mayor with ten municipal councilors as members, eight of which are elected, plus the representative of ''[[Sangguniang Kabataan]]'' and the president of the [[Association of Barangay Captains]] (ABC). It is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=28em|\n* Agutayan\n* Bagong Borbon\n* Basalem\n* Bawang\n* Bliss\n* Bulaan\n* Compostela\n* Danlugan\n* Datu Panas\n* Del Monte\n* Guintuloan\n* Guitom\n* Guminta\n* Labrador\n* Lantawan\n* Mabuhay\n* Maganay\n* Manlin\n* Muyo\n* Pamintayan\n* Pling\n* [[Poblacion]]\n* Pulog\n* San Jose\n* Talairan\n* Talamimi\n* Villacastor (Galit)\n}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Late Mayor Quirino Matugas Gonzales.jpg|thumbnail|right|160px|Quirino Matugas Gonzales, founder of the Municipality of Buug.]]\n\nBuug grew into a thriving community through the initiative of the ''timuays'', the Subanen chieftains, who held leadership of the community. A school was opened which drew in the first trickle of [[Subanon people|Subanon]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], and other [[Visayans|Visayan]] settlers. When the Samar Mining Company (SAMICO) opened the Sibuguey project in 1957 at Bobuan (now part of the municipality of [[Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur|Bayog]]), the next group of settlers flooded in. More people came when the Pagadian-Zamboanga National Highway reached Buug in 1958. The highway is part of the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] (also known as the Maharlika Highway and AH26).\n\nBuug was originally a [[barangay]] of the municipality of [[Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur|Margosatubig]] and became a baranggay of [[Malangas, Zamboanga Sibugay|Malangas]] when the former was divided in 1951. It became a municipality through Executive Order No. 380 issued by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] on February 2, 1960. Instrumental in the formation of Municipality of Buug was the persistence of Mr. Quirino M. Gonzales, a fisherman who also was a councilor of Malangas and a native of [[Merida, Leyte]]. He is also a distant relative of then Senator [[Neptali Gonzales]]. Gonzales became the first appointed mayor and was called the \"Father of Buug\". After being proclaimed as a municipality, flocks of settlers established residence and trade in the place.<ref>{{cite web|last=Manlin|first=Alicia|title=Municipality of Buug|url=http://www.sibugayprovince.com/index.php/the-mayors/buug|work=Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= none\n| cols = 2\n| title= Population census of Buug\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = \n| 1939 = \n| 1948 = \n| 1960 = \n| 1970 = 22858\n| 1975 = 25724\n| 1980 = 19648\n| 1990 = 32815\n| 1995 = 34175\n| 2000 = 33623\n| 2007 = 34289\n| 2010 = 35969\n| 2015 = 36634\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nCredit institutions and commercial businesses have multiplied. Appliance centers and merchandisers with main branches in big cities have invested in the area. [[Cottage industries]] have also sprouted. Buug\u2019s economy is based on two sectors categorized by the local government:\n# Agriculture which consists of farming, livestock & poultry, and fisheries.\n# Service Activities such as trade/commerce & industry, finance, personal and community service.\n\n==Education==\n\nThere are two higher education institutions in Buug. [[Mindanao State University\u2013Buug|Mindanao State University- Buug]]  offers courses in education, agriculture, fisheries, liberal arts, information technology, hospitality industry, environmental science, etc. It also has a high school which serves as the laboratory school of the College of Education.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Buug was derived from the word '<nowiki/>''bog'<nowiki/>'', a [[Subanon language|Subanen]] word for [[secondary forest]] which is the same as the Cebuano-Visayan term '<nowiki/>''buog'<nowiki/>''. Accordingly, a group of Subanens stumbled upon this '<nowiki/>''bog''' that was endowed with a stream and sufficient supply of water while they were moving from one place to another in search of a safe place to start a living away from marauders who were in search for slaves and things to loot. From then on people began to refer to the ''bog'' as Buug.\n\n==Geography==\n\nBuug is located in the central [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], on the island of [[Mindanao]]. It has a pentagon-like shape bounded on the south by [[Dumanquilas Bay]], [[Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur|Bayog]] on the north, [[Kumalarang, Zamboanga del Sur|Kumalarang]] on the east, [[Diplahan, Zamboanga Sibugay|Diplahan]] on the west, and [[Malangas, Zamboanga Sibugay|Malangas]] on south-west. The distance from [[Manila]] to Buug is approximately {{Convert|790|km}}. It is five hours away from [[Zamboanga City]] by bus, one hour and 45 minutes bus drive from the [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]], and {{Convert|57|km}} away from [[Pagadian]], or 45 minutes of travel by bus.\n\nIt has an average temperature of {{Convert|26|C}} and has an average elevation of {{Convert|200|m}} above sea level. It is away from the typhoon belt and enjoying a [[Climate of the Philippines|Type IV climate]], i.e. rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nBuug belongs to the first district of [[Zamboanga Sibugay]]. The local executive council is administered by a mayor. The legislative council is headed by a vice mayor with ten municipal councilors as members, eight of which are elected, plus the representative of ''[[Sangguniang Kabataan]]'' and the president of the [[Association of Barangay Captains]] (ABC). It is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=28em|\n* Agutayan\n* Bagong Borbon\n* Basalem\n* Bawang\n* Bliss\n* Bulaan\n* Compostela\n* Danlugan\n* Datu Panas\n* Del Monte\n* Guintuloan\n* Guitom\n* Guminta\n* Labrador\n* Lantawan\n* Mabuhay\n* Maganay\n* Manlin\n* Muyo\n* Pamintayan\n* Pling\n* [[Poblacion]]\n* Pulog\n* San Jose\n* Talairan\n* Talamimi\n* Villacastor (Galit)\n}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Late Mayor Quirino Matugas Gonzales.jpg|thumbnail|right|160px|Quirino Matugas Gonzales, founder of the Municipality of Buug.]]\n\nBuug grew into a thriving community through the initiative of the ''timuays'', the Subanen chieftains, who held leadership of the community. A school was opened which drew in the first trickle of [[Subanon people|Subanon]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], and other [[Visayans|Visayan]] settlers. When the Samar Mining Company (SAMICO) opened the Sibuguey project in 1957 at Bobuan (now part of the municipality of [[Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur|Bayog]]), the next group of settlers flooded in. More people came when the Pagadian-Zamboanga National Highway reached Buug in 1958. The highway is part of the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] (also known as the Maharlika Highway and AH26).\n\nBuug was originally a [[barangay]] of the municipality of [[Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur|Margosatubig]] and became a baranggay of [[Malangas, Zamboanga Sibugay|Malangas]] when the former was divided in 1951. It became a municipality through Executive Order No. 380 issued by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] on February 2, 1960. Instrumental in the formation of Municipality of Buug was the persistence of Mr. Quirino M. Gonzales, a fisherman who also was a councilor of Malangas and a native of [[Merida, Leyte]]. He is also a distant relative of then Senator [[Neptali Gonzales]]. Gonzales became the first appointed mayor and was called the \"Father of Buug\". After being proclaimed as a municipality, flocks of settlers established residence and trade in the place.<ref>{{cite web|last=Manlin|first=Alicia|title=Municipality of Buug|url=http://www.sibugayprovince.com/index.php/the-mayors/buug|work=Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= none\n| cols = 2\n| title= Population census of Buug\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = \n| 1939 = \n| 1948 = \n| 1960 = \n| 1970 = 22858\n| 1975 = 25724\n| 1980 = 19648\n| 1990 = 32815\n| 1995 = 34175\n| 2000 = 33623\n| 2007 = 34289\n| 2010 = 35969\n| 2015 = 36634\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nCredit institutions and commercial businesses have multiplied. Appliance centers and merchandisers with main branches in big cities have invested in the area. [[Cottage industries]] have also sprouted. Buug\u2019s economy is based on two sectors categorized by the local government:\n# Agriculture which consists of farming, livestock & poultry, and fisheries.\n# Service Activities such as trade/commerce & industry, finance, personal and community service.\n\n==Education==\n\nThere are two higher education institutions in Buug. [[Mindanao State University\u2013Buug|Mindanao State University- Buug]]  offers courses in education, agriculture, fisheries, liberal arts, information technology, hospitality industry, environmental science, etc. It also has a high school which serves as the laboratory school of the College of Education.
