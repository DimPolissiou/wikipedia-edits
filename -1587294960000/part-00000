After the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], he left for [[Paris]], where he made his directorial debut. He moved to [[Hollywood]] in 1933, and in 1939 he had a hit when he co-wrote the screenplay for the romantic comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]]. Wilder established his directorial reputation with an adaption of James M. Cain's ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a [[film noir]].

His parents were Eugenia (''n\u00e9e'' Dittler) and Max Wilder. He was nicknamed \"Billie\" by his mother (he changed this to \"Billy\" after arriving in America). He had an elder brother, [[W. Lee Wilder|William Lee Wilder]] (1904\u20131982), who also became a screenwriter, film producer, and director. His parents had a successful and well-known cake shop in Sucha's train station and unsuccessfully tried to persuade their son to join the family business. Soon the family moved to [[Vienna]], where Wilder attended school. Instead of attending the [[University of Vienna]], Wilder became a journalist. In 1926, jazz band leader [[Paul Whiteman]] was on tour in Vienna when he met and was interviewed by Wilder, a fan of Whiteman's band.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/29/us/billy-wilder-master-of-caustic-films-dies-at-95.html|title=Billy Wilder, Master of Caustic Films, Dies at 95|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|date=March 29, 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 4, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Whiteman liked young Wilder enough that he took him with the band to [[Berlin]], where Wilder was able to make more connections in the entertainment field.

Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. He collaborated with several other novices (with [[Fred Zinnemann]] and [[Robert Siodmak]]) on the 1929 feature ''[[Menschen am Sonntag|People on Sunday]]''. He wrote the screenplay for the 1931 film adaptation of a novel by [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], ''[[Emil and the Detectives (1931 film)|Emil and the Detectives]]''. After the [[rise of Adolf Hitler]], Wilder, Jewish, left for Paris, where he made his directorial debut with the 1934 film ''[[Mauvaise Graine]]''.

He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1939, having spent time in Mexico waiting for the US government after his six-month visa had expired in 1934, an episode reflected in his 1941 ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''.<ref name=\"Armstrong2004\">{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Armstrong |title=Billy Wilder, American Film Realist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYuACgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |date=2004 |page=9 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-2119-0}}</ref> Wilder's first significant success was ''[[Ninotchka]]'' in 1939, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. This [[romantic comedy]] starred [[Greta Garbo]] (generally known as a [[tragedy|tragic]] heroine in film [[melodrama]]s), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline, \"Garbo Laughs!\", it also took Garbo's career in a new direction. The film also marked Wilder's first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, which he shared with co-writer [[Charles Brackett]] (although their collaboration on ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'' had been well received). For twelve years Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett, from 1938 through 1950. He followed ''Ninotchka'' with a series of box office hits in 1942, including his ''Hold Back the Dawn'' and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', as well as his directorial feature debut, ''[[The Major and the Minor]]''.\n\nHis third film as director, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) was a major hit. A ''[[film noir]]'', nominated for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], although the two men did not get along. ''Double Indemnity'' not only set conventions for the ''noir'' genre (such as \"venetian blind\" lighting and voice-over narration), but was also a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. The original [[James M. Cain]] novel ''Double Indemnity'' featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the [[Hays Code]], because adultery was central to its plot. ''Double Indemnity'' is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' with the narrative elements of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941).\n\nDuring the liberation of concentration camps in 1945, the [[Psychological Warfare Department]] (PWD) of the United States Department of War produced an American propaganda documentary film directed by Billy Wilder. The film known as ''[[Death Mills]]'', or [[:de:Die Todesm\u00fchlen|''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'']], was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, ''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'', Hanu\u0161 Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version.\n\nTwo years later, Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R. Jackson]] story, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), the first major American film to make a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the dark and cynical ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', which paired rising star [[William Holden]] with [[Gloria Swanson]]. Swanson played Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star who, with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era, dreams of a [[wikt:comeback|comeback]]. Holden portrays an aspiring screenwriter who can't make ends meet and becomes a [[kept man]] to her. It was critically acclaimed and marked the end of Wilder's long writing partnership with Charles Brackett. In 1951, Wilder followed ''Sunset Boulevard'' with ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Carnival''), a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea for the film had been pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny. Desny sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the California copyright case ''Wilder v Desny'', ultimately receiving a settlement of $14,350.<ref>46 Cal.2d 715, 299 P.2d 257, CAL. 1956.</ref><ref>Sikov, Ed. ''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', Hyperion Press, 1998, pg. 328</ref> Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wilder also directed two adaptations of Broadway plays, the prisoner of war drama ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), which resulted in a Best Actor Oscar for [[William Holden]], and the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957). In the mid-1950s, Wilder became interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star [[Laurel and Hardy]]. He then held discussions with [[Groucho Marx]] concerning a new [[Marx Brothers]] comedy, tentatively titled \"A Day at the U.N.\" This project was abandoned when [[Chico Marx]] died in 1961.<ref name=\"Gore\">Gore, Chris (1999). ''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1950s onwards, Wilder made mostly comedies.<ref name=\"DavidCookhis\"/> Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). Wilder's humor is sometimes sardonic. In ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), a young and innocent [[Audrey Hepburn]] does not wish to be young or innocent with playboy [[Gary Cooper]], and pretends to be a married woman in search of extramarital amusement. The film was Wilder's first collaboration with writer-producer [[I. A. L. Diamond]], an association that continued until the end of both men's careers.\n\nIn 1959, United Artists released Wilder's Prohibition-era farce ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' without a [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] seal of approval, withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] play musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis's character courts a singer played by [[Marilyn Monroe]], while Lemmon is wooed by [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]]\u2014setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies \"Well, nobody's perfect\".  A box office success, the film was lightly regarded during its original release.  But its critical reputation grew prodigiously; in 2000, the [[American Film Institute]] selected it as the best American comedy ever made.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Funniest American Movies Of All Time |url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/laughs.aspx |work=[[American Film Institute]] |date=2000 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>  In 2012, the [[British Film Institute]] decennial [[Sight and Sound]] poll of the world's film critics rated it as the 43rd best movie ever made, and the second-highest-ranking comedy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |work=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}-</ref>\n\nAfter winning three [[Academy Awards]] for 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'' (for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay), Wilder's career slowed. His [[Cold War]] farce ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961) featured a rousing comic performance by [[James Cagney]]. It was followed by films including ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]''. Wilder gained his last Oscar nomination for his screenplay ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (UK: ''Meet Whiplash Willie'') (1966). His 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as a major [[roadshow theatrical release|roadshow release]], but was heavily cut by the studio and has never been fully restored.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Later films such as ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978) and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]'' (1981) failed to impress critics or the public.\n\n===Directorial style===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billy Wilder.jpg|thumb]] -->\nWilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder's pictures have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the end result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations.<ref>\"One Head Is Better than Two,\" in Films and Filming (London), February 1957.</ref> Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing [[silent film|silent era]] legends [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] out of retirement for roles in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.\n\nFor ''[[Stalag 17]]'', Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant [[William Holden]] (Holden had wanted to make his character more likable; Wilder refused). Wilder sometimes cast against type for major parts such as [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]''. MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. [[Humphrey Bogart]] shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''. [[James Cagney]], not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', [[Ray Milland]] in ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[William Holden]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Gloria Swanson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Erich von Stroheim]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Nancy Olson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] in ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', [[Charles Laughton]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Jack Kruschen]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Shirley MacLaine]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and [[Walter Matthau]] in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''. Milland, Holden and Matthau won Oscars for their performances in Wilder films. Wilder mentored [[Jack Lemmon]] and was the first director to pair him with Walter Matthau, in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966). Wilder had great respect for Lemmon, calling him the hardest working actor he had ever met. Lemmon starred in seven of Wilder's films.\n\nSome{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} say that Wilder's films often lacked any discernible political tone or sympathies, which was not unintentional. He was less interested in current political fashions than in human nature and the issues that confronted ordinary people. He was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and had little sympathy for those who were.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Of the blacklisted '[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]' Wilder said, \"Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly.\" In general, Wilder had an intense dislike for formula and genre films.<ref>Morris Dickstein (Spring 1988). \"Sunset Boulevard\" ''Grand Street'' Vol. 7 No. 3 p. 180</ref>\n\nOthers say that his films derive their parodies from the politics of the world around him, capitalist and Communist, and that Wilder opposed the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). He co-created the \u201cCommittee for the First Amendment\u201d, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to \u201csupport those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators\u201d. Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, \"I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath.\"<ref>Jos\u00e9-Vidal Pelaz L\u00f3pez.

(2012).</ref>\n\nWilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. In ''Ball of Fire'', his [[American burlesque|burlesque]] queen 'Sugarpuss' points at her sore throat and complains \"Pink? It's as red as the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and twice as sore.\" Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name \"[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\". Wilder is sometimes confused with director [[William Wyler]]; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking [[Jew]]s with similar backgrounds and names. However, their output as directors was quite different: Wyler preferred to direct epics and heavy dramas, while Wilder was noted for his comedies and [[film noir]] type dramas.\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:BW1989 crop.jpg|thumb|Billy Wilder in Berlin, 1989]]\nWilder was recognized with the [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid-80s, \"It's a sickness. I don't know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want \u2013 or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights, and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it.\"<ref>Ed Sikov. ''On Sunset Boulevard \u2013 the Life and Times of Billy Wilder''  \"Turnaround\", pg. 582.</ref> Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works of his own. By the early 90s, Wilder had amassed a beguiling assortment of plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer [[Louis Stern]], a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled ''Billy Wilder's March\u00e9 aux Puces'' and the ''Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete'' segment was an unqualified crowd pleaser. This series featured busts of the Egyptian queen wrapped ''\u00e0 la'' [[Christo]], or splattered ''\u00e0 la'' [[Jackson Pollock]], or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to [[Andy Warhol]].<ref>Charlotte Chandler. ''Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder \u2013 A Personal Biography''. \"Nefertete\", pg. 317.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946.  Wilder met [[Audrey Young (actress)|Audrey Young]] at [[Paramount Pictures]] on the set of ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' in 1945, and she became his second wife on June 30, 1949. They stayed together until his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/audrey-young-dies-billy-wilder-widow-334813|title=Audrey Young Dies; Actress and Widow of Billy Wilder|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|date=June 7, 2012|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWilder died in 2002 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 95 after battling health problems,<ref>{{cite news\n| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/28/billy.wilder.obit/\n| title=Legendary director Billy Wilder dead at 95\n| author=Clinton, Paul\n| work=[[CNN]]\n| date=March 29, 2002}}</ref> including cancer, at his home in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. He was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]] near [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s crypt is located in the same cemetery. Wilder died the same day as two other comedy legends: [[Milton Berle]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The next day, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' titled its front-page obituary, \"Billy Wilder dies. Nobody's perfect.\" \u2013 quoting the final gag line in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Billy Wilders grave (978339409).jpg|thumb|Wilder's gravestone]]\nWilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He is responsible for two of the film noir era's most definitive films in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. Along with [[Woody Allen]] and the [[Marx Brothers]], he leads the list of films on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|American Film Institute's list of 100 funniest American films]] with five films written as well as having the honor of holding the top spot on it with ''[[Some Like it Hot]]''. Also on the list are ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' which he directed, and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' and ''[[Ninotchka]]'' which he co-wrote. The [[American Film Institute]] has ranked four of Wilder's films among their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|top 100 American films of the 20th century]]: ''Sunset Boulevard'' (no. 12), ''Some Like It Hot'' (no. 14), ''Double Indemnity'' (no. 38) and ''The Apartment'' (no. 93). For the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|tenth anniversary edition of their list]], the AFI moved ''Sunset Boulevard'' to No. 16, ''Some Like it Hot'' to No. 22, ''Double Indemnity'' to No. 29 and ''The Apartment'' to No. 80.\n\nSpanish filmmaker [[Fernando Trueba]] said in his acceptance speech for the 1993 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film: \"I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so, thank you, Mr. Wilder.\" According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: \"Fernando, it's God.\" French filmmaker [[Michel Hazanavicius]] also thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] acceptance speech for ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' by saying \"I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder.\" Wilder's 12 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when [[Woody Allen]] received a 13th nomination for ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{main|Billy Wilder filmography}}\n\n==Awards==\nWilder received twenty one nominations at the [[Academy Awards]]; thirteen for his screenwriting, and eight for his direction. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), and ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960). The former was named the Best American Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the latter also won him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]]. Wilder garnered eight [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations with the sole win for his work on ''The Apartment''. He received seven nominations at the [[Golden Globe Awards]], winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950). He won seven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]] including two [[Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement|Laurel Awards for Screenwriting Achievement]]. He garnered lifetime achievement awards including the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[BAFTA Fellowship]], the [[David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures]], and the Honorary Golden Bear from the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Award\n!scope=\"col\"|Year{{efn|Year in which awards ceremony was held}}\n!scope=\"col\"|Film(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Category\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=22|[[Academy Awards]]\n|[[12th Academy Awards|1940]]\n|''[[Ninotchka]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]], and [[Walter Reisch]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1940|title=The 12th Academy Awards|accessdate=December 17, 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[14th Academy Awards|1942]]\n|''[[Ball of Fire]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Thomas Monroe (writer)|Thomas Monroe]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942|title=The 14th Academy Awards|accessdate=December 17, 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|name=Brackett|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[17th Academy Awards|1945]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{nom}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1945|title=The 17th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Raymond Chandler]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[18th Academy Awards|1946]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{won}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1946|title=The 18th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=December 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{won}}{{efn|name=Brackett}}\n|-\n|[[21st Academy Awards|1949]]\n|''[[A Foreign Affair]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]] and [[Richard L.

After the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], he left for [[Paris]], where he made his directorial debut. He moved to [[Hollywood]] in 1933, and in 1939 he had a hit when he co-wrote the screenplay for the romantic comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]]. Wilder established his directorial reputation with an adaption of James M. Cain's ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a [[film noir]].

His parents were Eugenia (''n\u00e9e'' Dittler) and Max Wilder. He was nicknamed \"Billie\" by his mother (he changed this to \"Billy\" after arriving in America). He had an elder brother, [[W. Lee Wilder|William Lee Wilder]] (1904\u20131982), who also became a screenwriter, film producer, and director. His parents had a successful and well-known cake shop in Sucha's train station and unsuccessfully tried to persuade their son to join the family business. Soon the family moved to [[Vienna]], where Wilder attended school. Instead of attending the [[University of Vienna]], Wilder became a journalist. In 1926, jazz band leader [[Paul Whiteman]] was on tour in Vienna when he met and was interviewed by Wilder, a fan of Whiteman's band.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/29/us/billy-wilder-master-of-caustic-films-dies-at-95.html|title=Billy Wilder, Master of Caustic Films, Dies at 95|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|date=2002-03-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Whiteman liked young Wilder enough that he took him with the band to [[Berlin]], where Wilder was able to make more connections in the entertainment field.

Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. He collaborated with several other novices (with [[Fred Zinnemann]] and [[Robert Siodmak]]) on the 1929 feature ''[[Menschen am Sonntag|People on Sunday]]''. He wrote the screenplay for the 1931 film adaptation of a novel by [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], ''[[Emil and the Detectives (1931 film)|Emil and the Detectives]]''. After the [[rise of Adolf Hitler]], Wilder, Jewish, left for Paris, where he made his directorial debut with the 1934 film ''[[Mauvaise Graine]]''.

He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1939, having spent time in Mexico waiting for the US government after his six-month visa had expired in 1934, an episode reflected in his 1941 ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''.<ref name=\"Armstrong2004\">{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Armstrong |title=Billy Wilder, American Film Realist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYuACgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |date=2004 |page=9 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-2119-0}}</ref> Wilder's first significant success was ''[[Ninotchka]]'' in 1939, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. This [[romantic comedy]] starred [[Greta Garbo]] (generally known as a [[tragedy|tragic]] heroine in film [[melodrama]]s), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline, \"Garbo Laughs!\", it also took Garbo's career in a new direction. The film also marked Wilder's first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, which he shared with co-writer [[Charles Brackett]] (although their collaboration on ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'' had been well received). For twelve years Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett, from 1938 through 1950. He followed ''Ninotchka'' with a series of box office hits in 1942, including his ''Hold Back the Dawn'' and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', as well as his directorial feature debut, ''[[The Major and the Minor]]''.\n\nHis third film as director, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) was a major hit. A ''[[film noir]]'', nominated for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], although the two men did not get along. ''Double Indemnity'' not only set conventions for the ''noir'' genre (such as \"venetian blind\" lighting and voice-over narration), but was also a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. The original [[James M. Cain]] novel ''Double Indemnity'' featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the [[Hays Code]], because adultery was central to its plot. ''Double Indemnity'' is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' with the narrative elements of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941).\n\nDuring the liberation of concentration camps in 1945, the [[Psychological Warfare Department]] (PWD) of the United States Department of War produced an American propaganda documentary film directed by Billy Wilder. The film known as ''[[Death Mills]]'', or [[:de:Die Todesm\u00fchlen|''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'']], was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, ''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'', Hanu\u0161 Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version.\n\nTwo years later, Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R. Jackson]] story, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), the first major American film to make a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the dark and cynical ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', which paired rising star [[William Holden]] with [[Gloria Swanson]]. Swanson played Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star who, with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era, dreams of a [[wikt:comeback|comeback]]. Holden portrays an aspiring screenwriter who can't make ends meet and becomes a [[kept man]] to her. It was critically acclaimed and marked the end of Wilder's long writing partnership with Charles Brackett. In 1951, Wilder followed ''Sunset Boulevard'' with ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Carnival''), a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea for the film had been pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny. Desny sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the California copyright case ''Wilder v Desny'', ultimately receiving a settlement of $14,350.<ref>46 Cal.2d 715, 299 P.2d 257, CAL. 1956.</ref><ref>Sikov, Ed. ''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', Hyperion Press, 1998, pg. 328</ref> Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wilder also directed two adaptations of Broadway plays, the prisoner of war drama ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), which resulted in a Best Actor Oscar for [[William Holden]], and the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957). In the mid-1950s, Wilder became interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star [[Laurel and Hardy]]. He then held discussions with [[Groucho Marx]] concerning a new [[Marx Brothers]] comedy, tentatively titled \"A Day at the U.N.\" This project was abandoned when [[Chico Marx]] died in 1961.<ref name=\"Gore\">Gore, Chris (1999). ''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1950s onwards, Wilder made mostly comedies.<ref name=\"DavidCookhis\"/> Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). Wilder's humor is sometimes sardonic. In ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), a young and innocent [[Audrey Hepburn]] does not wish to be young or innocent with playboy [[Gary Cooper]], and pretends to be a married woman in search of extramarital amusement. The film was Wilder's first collaboration with writer-producer [[I. A. L. Diamond]], an association that continued until the end of both men's careers.\n\nIn 1959, United Artists released Wilder's Prohibition-era farce ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' without a [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] seal of approval, withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] play musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis's character courts a singer played by [[Marilyn Monroe]], while Lemmon is wooed by [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]]\u2014setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies \"Well, nobody's perfect\".  A box office success, the film was lightly regarded during its original release.  But its critical reputation grew prodigiously; in 2000, the [[American Film Institute]] selected it as the best American comedy ever made.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Funniest American Movies Of All Time |url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/laughs.aspx |work=[[American Film Institute]] |date=2000 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>  In 2012, the [[British Film Institute]] decennial [[Sight and Sound]] poll of the world's film critics rated it as the 43rd best movie ever made, and the second-highest-ranking comedy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |work=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}-</ref>\n\nAfter winning three [[Academy Awards]] for 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'' (for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay), Wilder's career slowed. His [[Cold War]] farce ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961) featured a rousing comic performance by [[James Cagney]]. It was followed by films including ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]''. Wilder gained his last Oscar nomination for his screenplay ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (UK: ''Meet Whiplash Willie'') (1966). His 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as a major [[roadshow theatrical release|roadshow release]], but was heavily cut by the studio and has never been fully restored.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Later films such as ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978) and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]'' (1981) failed to impress critics or the public.\n\n===Directorial style===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billy Wilder.jpg|thumb]] -->\nWilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder's pictures have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the end result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations.<ref>\"One Head Is Better than Two,\" in Films and Filming (London), February 1957.</ref> Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing [[silent film|silent era]] legends [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] out of retirement for roles in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.\n\nFor ''[[Stalag 17]]'', Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant [[William Holden]] (Holden had wanted to make his character more likable; Wilder refused). Wilder sometimes cast against type for major parts such as [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]''. MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. [[Humphrey Bogart]] shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''. [[James Cagney]], not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', [[Ray Milland]] in ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[William Holden]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Gloria Swanson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Erich von Stroheim]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Nancy Olson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] in ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', [[Charles Laughton]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Jack Kruschen]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Shirley MacLaine]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and [[Walter Matthau]] in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''. Milland, Holden and Matthau won Oscars for their performances in Wilder films. Wilder mentored [[Jack Lemmon]] and was the first director to pair him with Walter Matthau, in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966). Wilder had great respect for Lemmon, calling him the hardest working actor he had ever met. Lemmon starred in seven of Wilder's films.\n\nSome{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} say that Wilder's films often lacked any discernible political tone or sympathies, which was not unintentional. He was less interested in current political fashions than in human nature and the issues that confronted ordinary people. He was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and had little sympathy for those who were.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Of the blacklisted '[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]' Wilder said, \"Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly.\" In general, Wilder had an intense dislike for formula and genre films.<ref>Morris Dickstein (Spring 1988). \"Sunset Boulevard\" ''Grand Street'' Vol. 7 No. 3 p. 180</ref>\n\nOthers say that his films derive their parodies from the politics of the world around him, capitalist and Communist, and that Wilder opposed the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). He co-created the \u201cCommittee for the First Amendment\u201d, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to \u201csupport those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators\u201d. Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, \"I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath.\"<ref>Jos\u00e9-Vidal Pelaz L\u00f3pez.

(2012).</ref>\n\nWilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. In ''Ball of Fire'', his [[American burlesque|burlesque]] queen 'Sugarpuss' points at her sore throat and complains \"Pink? It's as red as the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and twice as sore.\" Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name \"[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\". Wilder is sometimes confused with director [[William Wyler]]; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking [[Jew]]s with similar backgrounds and names. However, their output as directors was quite different: Wyler preferred to direct epics and heavy dramas, while Wilder was noted for his comedies and [[film noir]] type dramas.\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:BW1989 crop.jpg|thumb|Billy Wilder in Berlin, 1989]]\nWilder was recognized with the [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid-80s, \"It's a sickness. I don't know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want \u2013 or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights, and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it.\"<ref>Ed Sikov. ''On Sunset Boulevard \u2013 the Life and Times of Billy Wilder''  \"Turnaround\", pg. 582.</ref> Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works of his own. By the early 90s, Wilder had amassed a beguiling assortment of plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer [[Louis Stern]], a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled ''Billy Wilder's March\u00e9 aux Puces'' and the ''Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete'' segment was an unqualified crowd pleaser. This series featured busts of the Egyptian queen wrapped ''\u00e0 la'' [[Christo]], or splattered ''\u00e0 la'' [[Jackson Pollock]], or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to [[Andy Warhol]].<ref>Charlotte Chandler. ''Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder \u2013 A Personal Biography''. \"Nefertete\", pg. 317.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946.  Wilder met [[Audrey Young (actress)|Audrey Young]] at [[Paramount Pictures]] on the set of ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' in 1945, and she became his second wife on June 30, 1949. They stayed together until his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/audrey-young-dies-billy-wilder-widow-334813|title=Audrey Young Dies; Actress and Widow of Billy Wilder|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|date=June 7, 2012|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWilder died in 2002 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 95 after battling health problems,<ref>{{cite news\n| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/28/billy.wilder.obit/\n| title=Legendary director Billy Wilder dead at 95\n| author=Clinton, Paul\n| work=[[CNN]]\n| date=March 29, 2002}}</ref> including cancer, at his home in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. He was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]] near [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s crypt is located in the same cemetery. Wilder died the same day as two other comedy legends: [[Milton Berle]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The next day, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' titled its front-page obituary, \"Billy Wilder dies. Nobody's perfect.\" \u2013 quoting the final gag line in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Billy Wilders grave (978339409).jpg|thumb|Wilder's gravestone]]\nWilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He is responsible for two of the film noir era's most definitive films in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. Along with [[Woody Allen]] and the [[Marx Brothers]], he leads the list of films on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|American Film Institute's list of 100 funniest American films]] with five films written as well as having the honor of holding the top spot on it with ''[[Some Like it Hot]]''. Also on the list are ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' which he directed, and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' and ''[[Ninotchka]]'' which he co-wrote. The [[American Film Institute]] has ranked four of Wilder's films among their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|top 100 American films of the 20th century]]: ''Sunset Boulevard'' (no. 12), ''Some Like It Hot'' (no. 14), ''Double Indemnity'' (no. 38) and ''The Apartment'' (no. 93). For the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|tenth anniversary edition of their list]], the AFI moved ''Sunset Boulevard'' to No. 16, ''Some Like it Hot'' to No. 22, ''Double Indemnity'' to No. 29 and ''The Apartment'' to No. 80.\n\nSpanish filmmaker [[Fernando Trueba]] said in his acceptance speech for the 1993 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film: \"I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so, thank you, Mr. Wilder.\" According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: \"Fernando, it's God.\" French filmmaker [[Michel Hazanavicius]] also thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] acceptance speech for ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' by saying \"I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder.\" Wilder's 12 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when [[Woody Allen]] received a 13th nomination for ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{main|Billy Wilder filmography}}\n\n==Awards==\nWilder received twenty one nominations at the [[Academy Awards]]; thirteen for his screenwriting, and eight for his direction. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), and ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960). The former was named the Best American Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the latter also won him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]]. Wilder garnered eight [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations with the sole win for his work on ''The Apartment''. He received seven nominations at the [[Golden Globe Awards]], winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950). He won seven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]] including two [[Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement|Laurel Awards for Screenwriting Achievement]]. He garnered lifetime achievement awards including the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[BAFTA Fellowship]], the [[David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures]], and the Honorary Golden Bear from the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Award\n!scope=\"col\"|Year{{efn|Year in which awards ceremony was held}}\n!scope=\"col\"|Film(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Category\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=22|[[Academy Awards]]\n|[[12th Academy Awards|1940]]\n|''[[Ninotchka]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]], and [[Walter Reisch]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1940|title=The 12th Academy Awards|accessdate=17 December 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[14th Academy Awards|1942]]\n|''[[Ball of Fire]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Thomas Monroe (writer)|Thomas Monroe]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942|title=The 14th Academy Awards|accessdate=17 December 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|name=Brackett|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[17th Academy Awards|1945]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{nom}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1945|title=The 17th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Raymond Chandler]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[18th Academy Awards|1946]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{won}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1946|title=The 18th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{won}}{{efn|name=Brackett}}\n|-\n|[[21st Academy Awards|1949]]\n|''[[A Foreign Affair]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]] and [[Richard L.

He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|were divided]] among the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sasanian Empire, reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the [[Caucasus]], as well as other major parts of the [[West Asia|west]] and [[central Asia]], and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.<ref name=\"books.google.nl\"/>\n\n[[File:Mooze Naderi.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Nader Shah]], the powerful [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler, at Naderi Museum.]]\nNader Shah [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invaded India and sacked far off Delhi]] by the late 1730s. His territorial expansion, as well as his military successes, went into a decline following the final [[Nader's Dagestan campaign|campaigns in the Northern Caucasus]] against then revolting [[Lezgins]]. The assassination of Nader Shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] of the [[Zand dynasty]] came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.<ref name=Immortal/>\n\n====Zands====\n{{main|Zand dynasty}}\nCompared to its preceding dynasties, the geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited. Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained ''de facto'' autonomy, and were locally ruled through various [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Caucasian khanates]]. However, despite the self-ruling, they all remained [[commoner|subjects]] and vassals to the Zand king.<ref>Encyclopedia of Soviet law By Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge, Gerard Pieter van den Berg, William B. Simons, Page 457</ref> Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779, out of which [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]] emerged, founding the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1794.\n\n====Qajars====\n{{main|Qajar Iran}}\nIn 1795, following the disobedience of the [[Georgians|Georgian]] subjects and their [[Treaty of Georgievsk|alliance with the Russians]], the Qajars captured [[Tbilisi]] by the [[Battle of Krtsanisi]], and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing the Iranian [[suzerainty]] over the region.\n\n[[File:Gulistan-Treaty.jpg|thumb|left|A map showing the 19th-century northwestern borders of Iran, comprising modern-day eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Armenia]], and the [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]], before being ceded to the neighboring [[Russian Empire]] by the [[Russo-Persian Wars|Russo-Iranian wars]].]]\nThe Russo-Iranian wars of [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u201313)|1804\u20131813]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u201328)|1826\u20131828]] resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus, comprising all of [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Dagestan]], which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries,{{sfn|Fisher|Avery|Hambly|Melville|1991|pp=329\u2013330}} and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire.\n\nAs a result of the 19th-century Russo-Iranian wars, the Russians took over the Caucasus, and Iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region (comprising modern-day Dagestan, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]]), which got confirmed per the treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]].<ref name=\"Timothy C.

Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], and the unelected institutions under his control. Human rights abuses continued unabated in 2016, with the authorities carrying out Iran's largest mass execution in years and launching a renewed crackdown on women's rights activists. The regime maintained restrictions on freedom of expression, both offline and online, and made further arrests of journalists, bloggers, labor union activists, and dual nationals visiting the country, with some facing heavy prison sentences. Hard-liners in control of powerful institutions, including the judiciary and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were behind many of the year's abuses. There were no indications that President Hassan Rouhani, a self-proclaimed moderate seeking reelection in 2017, was willing or able to push back against repressive forces and deliver the greater social freedoms he had promised. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi remained under house arrest for a sixth year without being formally charged or put on trial.

ethnic groups and the influences from the neighboring cultures, the cuisine of Iran is diverse. Herbs are frequently used, along with fruits such as plums, pomegranate, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavorings such as saffron, dried lime, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onion and garlic are commonly used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form.\n\nIranian cuisine includes a wide range of main dishes, including various types of [[kebab]], [[pilaf]], [[stew]] ([[khoresh]]), [[soup]] and [[\u0101sh]], and [[omelette]].

On the other hand, when the Safavids (not Reza Shah, as is popularly assumed) revived a national state officially known as Iran, bureaucratic usage in the Ottoman empire and even Iran itself could still refer to it by other descriptive and traditional appellations.|isbn=9781845110628 }}</ref>\n| established_event5                = [[Buyid dynasty]]\n| established_date5                = 934 AD\n| established_event6                = [[Safavid dynasty]]\n| established_date6                = 1501<ref name=\"Andrew J.

The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from [[peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian populations]] into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s, which was caused by internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the [[Hotak dynasty|Pashtun rebels]] who besieged Isfahan and defeated [[Sultan Husayn]] in 1722.\n\n====Afsharids====\n{{main||Afsharid dynasty}}\nIn 1729, [[Nader Shah]], a chieftain and military genius from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders. He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|were divided]] among the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sasanian Empire, reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the [[Caucasus]], as well as other major parts of the [[West Asia|west]] and [[central Asia]], and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.<ref name=\"books.google.nl\"/>\n\n[[File:Mooze Naderi.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Nader Shah]], the powerful [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler, at Naderi Museum.]]\nNader Shah [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invaded India and sacked far off Delhi]] by the late 1730s. His territorial expansion, as well as his military successes, went into a decline following the final [[Nader's Dagestan campaign|campaigns in the Northern Caucasus]] against then revolting [[Lezgins]]. The assassination of Nader Shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] of the [[Zand dynasty]] came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.<ref name=Immortal/>\n\n====Zands====\n{{main|Zand dynasty}}\nCompared to its preceding dynasties, the geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited. Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained ''de facto'' autonomy, and were locally ruled through various [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Caucasian khanates]]. However, despite the self-ruling, they all remained [[commoner|subjects]] and vassals to the Zand king.<ref>Encyclopedia of Soviet law By Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge, Gerard Pieter van den Berg, William B.

Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], and the unelected institutions under his control. Human rights abuses continued unabated in 2016, with the authorities carrying out Iran's largest mass execution in years and launching a renewed crackdown on women's rights activists. The regime maintained restrictions on freedom of expression, both offline and online, and made further arrests of journalists, bloggers, labor union activists, and dual nationals visiting the country, with some facing heavy prison sentences. Hard-liners in control of powerful institutions, including the judiciary and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were behind many of the year's abuses. There were no indications that President Hassan Rouhani, a self-proclaimed moderate seeking reelection in 2017, was willing or able to push back against repressive forces and deliver the greater social freedoms he had promised. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi remained under house arrest for a sixth year without being formally charged or put on trial.

ethnic groups and the influences from the neighboring cultures, the cuisine of Iran is diverse. Herbs are frequently used, along with fruits such as plums, pomegranate, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavorings such as saffron, dried lime, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onion and garlic are commonly used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form.\n\nIranian cuisine includes a wide range of main dishes, including various types of [[kebab]], [[pilaf]], [[stew]] ([[khoresh]]), [[soup]] and [[\u0101sh]], and [[omelette]].

After a successful incursion as far as [[Eshowe]] (then also known as '''Fort Ekowe''' or '''kwaMondi'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=THD18790714.2.19|title=Life in Ekowe Fort|work=natlib.govt.nz|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battlefieldsroute.co.za/place/the-siege-of-fort-kwamondi The Siege of Fort KwaMondi],  Battlefields Route</ref>), Colonel [[Charles Pearson (soldier)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged there for two months by the Zulus.\n\n==Prelude: Inyezane==\n\nNo.1 Column of the British invasion force, under Colonel Charles Pearson, had been ordered to establish an advanced base at Eshowe before continuing the advance upon [[Ulundi]]. The force crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] on 12 January 1879. The advance was smooth and steady until 22 January, when a Zulu force attempted to bar their way. The British were camped about 4 miles south of the [[Inyezane River]], which they had crossed the previous day, beneath a steep ridge with three spurs leading down towards the river, and surrounded by scrub. A prominent knoll sat about halfway, and a small [[kraal]] near the left of the crest.\n\nShortly after 08:00 a small number of Zulus appeared near the knoll on the ridge, and a company of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), under Lieutenant Hart, were sent up the spur after them. While this company gave chase a mass of Zulus appeared over the crest of the ridge and began pouring downwards. These men were the left \"horn\" of a 6,000 strong force, dispatched at the same time as the army that engaged the British at Isandlwana, who were preparing just over the crest, to attack the British camp. This left horn had been prompted into a premature attack by the advance of Lieutenant Hart's company, and in the face of this advance the NNC fled, leaving their European officers and NCOs to make a fruitless stand before being swept aside. As soon as Hart and his men began firing, the camp prepared for defence, forming a hasty firing line. A naval company and two companies of [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] with a [[Gatling gun]] and 7-pounders moved up to the knoll, opening up across the advancing Zulu column. Thus, when the Zulus emerged from scrub and began their assault on the camp, they were taking heavy fire on both their flank and front of their force. The Zulus wavered and then withdrew the way they had come.\n\nWhile the left horn was being repulsed, the rest of the Zulu [[impi]] appeared over the crest. The kraal was taken, and switching their guns to focus on it, the force previously attacking the left horn's flank advanced up the slope and captured the kraal. This position allowed the British to move the Gatling gun onto the crest where its rapid fire soon drove the Zulus off the centre and left end of the ridge, as the British mounted troops came up the right-hand spur to complete the action. The successful counter-attack resulted in 10 British killed and 16 wounded. The Zulu impi withdrew with 350 killed.\n\n==Arrival at Eshowe==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Crossingtugela.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Troops crossing the Tugela River.]] -->\nPearson continued his march unhindered and the following day reached the mission fort near Eshowe at {{coord|28|54|28.7|S|31|27|41|E|type:landmark|name=Fort Nongqwayi}}, 2,000 feet above sea level. Eshowe consisted of a deserted church, school and the house of a [[Norway|Norwegian]] missionary. Low hills surrounded it about a quarter of a mile away to the north, east and west, but to the south the Indian Ocean could be seen. Pearson sent a group of empty wagons, with escorts, to collect fresh supplies from the Lower Drift while the rest of his force began entrenching themselves. The next day, 24 January, bore a disturbing message for Pearson: Col. [[Anthony Durnford]]'s No. 2 column had been wiped out in the Middle Drift, leaving the Lower Drift behind Eshowe in grave danger. If the Zulus took the lower drift, Eshowe would be cut off and there would be nothing between the Zulu Army and Natal.\n\nTwo days later, [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] contacted Pearson. Without giving any details of the disaster at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]] he informed him that all previous orders were cancelled, and that he was to take such as action as he thought fit to preserve his column, including withdrawal from Eshowe if necessary. If he withdrew, he was to hold the bridgehead at the Lower Drift, but he might be attacked by the whole Zulu Army. Pearson had no precise information on the whereabouts of the enemy, and although his defences around the mission would soon be complete, it was not an ideal position to defend. His force was good for ammunition, but other supplies were insufficient and the general consensus of his subordinates was to pull back to the Lower Drift. The decision to stay was settled on when news arrived of the return of the supply wagons, with five further companies as reinforcement from the Lower Drift.\n\n==Eshowe besieged==\n\nThe fort enclosing the mission was roughly rectangular, 200 yards long and 50 yards wide, with loopholed walls 6 feet high, and was surrounded by a broad ditch in which sharpened sticks were embedded. A second line of defence, should the outer rampart fall, was formed by [[laager]]ing the wagons inside the walls. A horse and cattle kraal was constructed, as was an [[abattis]], and a field of fire was cleared all round out to 800 yards. The garrison numbered 1,300 soldiers and sailors, plus 400 wagoners.\n\nThe appearance of large bodies of Zulu on the surrounding hills on 2 February, although they retreated under shelling from the 7-pounders, compelled Pearson to request reinforcements. A week later, he learned for the first time the full extent of the centre column's defeat at Isandlwana and was told that no reinforcements could be made. Pearson was on his own, but could still withdraw. Pearson considered withdrawing part of his garrison, if Chelmsford agreed, but receiving no response and no further runners, it became clear that Eshowe was now completely cut off. The garrison would run out of provisions by the beginning of April.<ref>Thompson, Paul Singer. ''Black soldiers of the queen: the Natal native contingent in the Anglo-Zulu War'', University of Alabama Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8173-5368-2}}, p.47, p. 92.</ref>\n\nFebruary passed with no Zulu attack, save for sniping attacks and skirmishes between patrols. The beginning of March led Pearson to attack a kraal 7 miles away, to keep the soldiers from idling. The next day a [[heliostat]] was spotted signalling from [[Fort Tenedos]] and a makeshift apparatus allowed Eshowe to reply. The garrison learnt that a relief force would depart the Lower Drift on 13 March and that they were to advance to the Inyezane to meet it. This was cheering news for the garrison, with rations running low and sickness having killed 20 men. A few days later another message advised a delay in the arrival of the relief column until 1 April.\n\n==The Relief Column==\n{{main|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n\n[[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] led this column, consisting of 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans to relieve the forces at [[Eshowe]]. The force had a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders, four 24-pounder rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s. The progress was slow, as in addition to taking a roundabout route to avoid ambush, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains. By the evening of 1 April, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane. The laager was sited on a 300-foot ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot [[Umisi Hill]]. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which itself encompassed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards in length. Here the relief column fought the [[Battle of Gingindlovu]], a British victory, before continuing on to Eshowe.\n\n==Eshowe relieved==\n\nOn 3 April, the relief column entered Eshowe, led by the pipers of the [[91st Highlanders]]. The two-month siege had been lifted. Chelmsford concluded that Eshowe did not need to be retained, and the laboriously constructed defences were demolished. Bivouacking on the first night after their departure from it on 6 April, Pearson's men could see that the Zulus had set Eshowe alight.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brookes|first1=Edgar H|authorlink=|last2=Webb |first2=Colin de B. |title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances E.|first2=Edward |last2=Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26\u201333|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

After a successful incursion as far as [[Eshowe]] (then also known as '''Fort Ekowe''' or '''kwaMondi'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=THD18790714.2.19|title=Life in Ekowe Fort|work=natlib.govt.nz|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battlefieldsroute.co.za/place/the-siege-of-fort-kwamondi The Siege of Fort KwaMondi],  Battlefields Route</ref>), Colonel [[Charles Pearson (soldier)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged there for two months by the Zulus.\n\n==Prelude: Inyezane==\n\nNo.1 Column of the British invasion force, under Colonel Charles Pearson, had been ordered to establish an advanced base at Eshowe before continuing the advance upon [[Ulundi]]. The force crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] on 12 January 1879. The advance was smooth and steady until 22 January, when a Zulu force attempted to bar their way. The British were camped about 4 miles south of the [[Inyezane River]], which they had crossed the previous day, beneath a steep ridge with three spurs leading down towards the river, and surrounded by scrub. A prominent knoll sat about halfway, and a small [[kraal]] near the left of the crest.\n\nShortly after 08:00 a small number of Zulus appeared near the knoll on the ridge, and a company of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), under Lieutenant Hart, were sent up the spur after them. While this company gave chase a mass of Zulus appeared over the crest of the ridge and began pouring downwards. These men were the left \"horn\" of a 6,000 strong force, dispatched at the same time as the army that engaged the British at Isandlwana, who were preparing just over the crest, to attack the British camp. This left horn had been prompted into a premature attack by the advance of Lieutenant Hart's company, and in the face of this advance the NNC fled, leaving their European officers and NCOs to make a fruitless stand before being swept aside. As soon as Hart and his men began firing, the camp prepared for defence, forming a hasty firing line. A naval company and two companies of [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] with a [[Gatling gun]] and 7-pounders moved up to the knoll, opening up across the advancing Zulu column. Thus, when the Zulus emerged from scrub and began their assault on the camp, they were taking heavy fire on both their flank and front of their force. The Zulus wavered and then withdrew the way they had come.\n\nWhile the left horn was being repulsed, the rest of the Zulu [[impi]] appeared over the crest. The kraal was taken, and switching their guns to focus on it, the force previously attacking the left horn's flank advanced up the slope and captured the kraal. This position allowed the British to move the Gatling gun onto the crest where its rapid fire soon drove the Zulus off the centre and left end of the ridge, as the British mounted troops came up the right-hand spur to complete the action. The successful counter-attack resulted in 10 British killed and 16 wounded. The Zulu impi withdrew with 350 killed.\n\n==Arrival at Eshowe==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Crossingtugela.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Troops crossing the Tugela River.]] -->\nPearson continued his march unhindered and the following day reached the mission fort near Eshowe at {{coord|28|54|28.7|S|31|27|41|E|type:landmark|name=Fort Nongqwayi}}, 2,000 feet above sea level. Eshowe consisted of a deserted church, school and the house of a [[Norway|Norwegian]] missionary. Low hills surrounded it about a quarter of a mile away to the north, east and west, but to the south the Indian Ocean could be seen. Pearson sent a group of empty wagons, with escorts, to collect fresh supplies from the Lower Drift while the rest of his force began entrenching themselves. The next day, 24 January, bore a disturbing message for Pearson: Col. [[Anthony Durnford]]'s No. 2 column had been wiped out in the Middle Drift, leaving the Lower Drift behind Eshowe in grave danger. If the Zulus took the lower drift, Eshowe would be cut off and there would be nothing between the Zulu Army and Natal.\n\nTwo days later, [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] contacted Pearson. Without giving any details of the disaster at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]] he informed him that all previous orders were cancelled, and that he was to take such as action as he thought fit to preserve his column, including withdrawal from Eshowe if necessary. If he withdrew, he was to hold the bridgehead at the Lower Drift, but he might be attacked by the whole Zulu Army. Pearson had no precise information on the whereabouts of the enemy, and although his defences around the mission would soon be complete, it was not an ideal position to defend. His force was good for ammunition, but other supplies were insufficient and the general consensus of his subordinates was to pull back to the Lower Drift. The decision to stay was settled on when news arrived of the return of the supply wagons, with five further companies as reinforcement from the Lower Drift.\n\n==Eshowe besieged==\n\nThe fort enclosing the mission was roughly rectangular, 200 yards long and 50 yards wide, with loopholed walls 6 feet high, and was surrounded by a broad ditch in which sharpened sticks were embedded. A second line of defence, should the outer rampart fall, was formed by [[laager]]ing the wagons inside the walls. A horse and cattle kraal was constructed, as was an [[abattis]], and a field of fire was cleared all round out to 800 yards. The garrison numbered 1,300 soldiers and sailors, plus 400 wagoners.\n\nThe appearance of large bodies of Zulu on the surrounding hills on 2 February, although they retreated under shelling from the 7-pounders, compelled Pearson to request reinforcements. A week later, he learned for the first time the full extent of the centre column's defeat at Isandlwana and was told that no reinforcements could be made. Pearson was on his own, but could still withdraw. Pearson considered withdrawing part of his garrison, if Chelmsford agreed, but receiving no response and no further runners, it became clear that Eshowe was now completely cut off. The garrison would run out of provisions by the beginning of April.<ref>Thompson, Paul Singer. ''Black soldiers of the queen: the Natal native contingent in the Anglo-Zulu War'', University of Alabama Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8173-5368-2}}, p.47, p. 92.</ref>\n\nFebruary passed with no Zulu attack, save for sniping attacks and skirmishes between patrols. The beginning of March led Pearson to attack a kraal 7 miles away, to keep the soldiers from idling. The next day a [[heliostat]] was spotted signalling from [[Fort Tenedos]] and a makeshift apparatus allowed Eshowe to reply. The garrison learnt that a relief force would depart the Lower Drift on 13 March and that they were to advance to the Inyezane to meet it. This was cheering news for the garrison, with rations running low and sickness having killed 20 men. A few days later another message advised a delay in the arrival of the relief column until 1 April.\n\n==The Relief Column==\n{{main|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n\n[[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] led this column, consisting of 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans to relieve the forces at [[Eshowe]]. The force had a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders, four 24-pounder rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s. The progress was slow, as in addition to taking a roundabout route to avoid ambush, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains. By the evening of 1 April, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane. The laager was sited on a 300-foot ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot [[Umisi Hill]]. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which itself encompassed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards in length. Here the relief column fought the [[Battle of Gingindlovu]], a British victory, before continuing on to Eshowe.\n\n==Eshowe relieved==\n\nOn 3 April, the relief column entered Eshowe, led by the pipers of the [[91st Highlanders]]. The two-month siege had been lifted. Chelmsford concluded that Eshowe did not need to be retained, and the laboriously constructed defences were demolished. Bivouacking on the first night after their departure from it on 6 April, Pearson's men could see that the Zulus had set Eshowe alight.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brookes|first1=Edgar H|authorlink=|last2=Webb |first2=Colin de B. |title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances E.|first2=Edward |last2=Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26\u201333|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.
