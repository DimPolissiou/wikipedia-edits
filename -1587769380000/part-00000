However, Sinatra recalled wanting to become a pianist and songwriter from his earliest days.\n\n===Kidnapping===\nSinatra was kidnapped at the age of 19, on December 8, 1963, at [[Harrah's Lake Tahoe]] (room 417).<ref name=kidnapping /> He was released two days later after his father paid the $240,000 [[ransom]] demanded by the kidnappers ({{Inflation|US|240000|1963|fmt=eq|r=-4}}).

The younger Sinatra was technically not a \"junior\" (his father's middle name was Albert) but was nonetheless known as Frank Jr. throughout his life.  Sinatra Jr. hardly saw his father, who was constantly on the road, either performing or working in films. However, Sinatra recalled wanting to become a pianist and songwriter from his earliest days.\n\n===Kidnapping===\nSinatra was kidnapped at the age of 19, on December 8, 1963, at [[Harrah's Lake Tahoe]] (room 417).<ref name=kidnapping /> He was released two days later after his father paid the $240,000 [[ransom]] demanded by the kidnappers ({{Inflation|US|240000|1963|fmt=eq|r=-4}}). [[Barry Keenan]], Johnny Irwin, and Joe Amsler were soon captured, prosecuted for kidnapping, convicted, and sentenced to long [[prison]] terms, of which they served only small portions. Mastermind Keenan was later adjudged to have been legally [[insanity|insane]] at the time of the crime and hence not legally responsible for his actions.<ref name=kidnapping>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/frank_sinatra_jr/1_index.html |title=The Kidnapping of Frank Sinatra Jr. \u2013 The Snatch \u2013|website=Crime Library on Trutv.com |date=December 8, 1963 |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> Famed attorney [[Gladys Root]] represented Johnny Irwin.\n\nThe kidnappers demanded that all communication be conducted by [[payphone]].

In 2005, the judges of the [[50th Filmfare Awards]] named it the [[Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years|Best Film of 50 Years]].\n\nThe film was shot in the rocky terrain of [[Ramanagara]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/the-hills-around-bengaluru-are-alive-with-the-sound-of-tourists/article29292458.ece|title=The hills around Bengaluru are alive with the sound of tourists|last=Prabhu|first=Nagesh|date=2019-08-29|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-02-03|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> in the [[South India|southern]] state of [[Karnataka]], over a span of two and a half years. After the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] mandated the removal of several violent scenes, ''Sholay'' was released with a length of 198&nbsp;minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204&nbsp;minutes became available on home media. When first released, ''Sholay'' received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. The film was also an [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|overseas success]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. It was the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian film]] ever at the time, and was the [[List of highest-grossing films in India|highest-grossing film in India]] up until ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994). By some accounts, ''Sholay'' remains the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe film is a [[Dacoit Western]] (sometimes called a \"[[Curry Western]]\"), combining the conventions of Indian [[dacoit film]]s with that of [[Spaghetti Western]]s along with elements of [[Samurai cinema]]. ''Sholay'' is also a defining example of the [[masala film]], which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, [[homosocial]] bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory.<ref>For glorification of violence, see Wimal Dissanayake, Malti Sahai, ''Sholay: A Cultural Reading (Delhi: Wiley Eastern, 1992), 115-19. {{ISBN|8122403948}}; for fuedal ethos, see Hrishikesh Ingle, \"Regionalist Disjuncture in Bollywood\", in Vikrant Kishore et al., eds., ''Salaam Bollywood: Representations and interpretations'' (London: Routledge, 2016), 202. {{ISBN|1317232852}}; on social order/disorder, see Dissanayake, \"The Concepts of Evil and Social Order in Indian Melodrama: An Evolving Dialect\", in ''Melodrama and Asian Cinema'', ed.

D. Burman]], and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural [[meme]]s and becoming part of India's daily [[vernacular]]. In January 2014, ''Sholay'' was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Baldev Singh summons a pair of small-time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo{{snd}}Veeru and Jai{{snd}}would be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh, a [[Dacoity|dacoit]] wanted by the authorities for a {{INR}}50,000{{efn|name=exchange|The exchange rate in 1975 was 8.94 Indian rupees ({{INR}}) per 1 US dollar (US$).{{sfn|Statistical Abstract of the United States|1977|p=917}}}} reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional {{INR}}20,000 reward.\n\nThe two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of [[Holi]]. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Though Thakur has a gun within his reach, he does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and had both his arms cut off a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a [[shawl]].\n\nLiving in Ramgarh, the jovial Veeru and cynical Jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers. Veeru is attracted to Basanti, a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse-cart. Jai is drawn to Radha, Thakur's reclusive, widowed daughter-in-law, who subtly returns his affections.\n\nSkirmishes between Gabbar's gang and Jai-Veeru finally result in the capture of Veeru and Basanti by the dacoits. Jai attacks the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place. Meanwhile, Jai, who is continuing the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range.\n\nVeeru returns, and Jai dies in his arms. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and catches the dacoit. Veeru nearly beats Gabbar to death when Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the promise to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and destroy his hands. The police then arrive and arrest Gabbar. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train. Radha is left alone again.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dharmendra]] as Veeru\n* [[Sanjeev Kumar]] as [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Baldev Singh\n* [[Hema Malini]] as Basanti\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Jai (Jaidev)\n* [[Jaya Bhaduri]] as Radha, Thakur's daughter-in-law\n* [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] as [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]]\n* [[Satyen Kappu]] as Ramlaal, Thakur's servant\n* [[A.

Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society.{{sfn|Prasad|1998|pp=156\u2013160}} Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept [[Feudalism|feudal order]].{{sfn|Prasad|1998|pp=156\u2013160}} Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.{{sfn|Banerjea|2005|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\nGabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=199}} Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=199}} He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=200}} He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in ''Sholay'', the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=200}} Dissanayake argues that ''Sholay'' can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=201}} The narrative style of ''Sholay'', with its violence, revenge, and [[vigilante]] action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in [[the Emergency (India)|the Emergency]] ([[rule by decree]]) declared by prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1975.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayward|1y=2006|1pp=63\u201364|2a1=Holtzman|2y=2011|2p=118}}\n\nDissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully \"Indianised\".{{sfnm|1a1=Dissanayake|1a2=Sahai|1y=1992|1p=125|2a1=Dissanayake|2y=1993|2p=197}} As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in ''Sholay'' with a similar scene in ''Once Upon a Time in the West''. Although both films were similar in technical style, ''Sholay'' emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach.{{sfn|Heide|2002|p=52}} Maithili Rao, in ''Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema'', notes that ''Sholay'' infuses the style of the Western genre into a \"feudalistic ethos\".{{sfn|Rao|2003|p=95}} Ted Shen of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' notes ''Sholay''{{'}}s \"hysterical visual style\" and intermittent \"populist message\".<ref name=\"shen chic reader\" /> Cultural critic and Islamic scholar [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lampoons the film in his book ''The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema'', both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers.{{sfn|Sardar|1998|pp=48\u201349}} Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam).

P. Sippy]]. The film is about two criminals, Veeru and Jai (played by [[Dharmendra]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]] respectively), hired by a retired police officer ([[Sanjeev Kumar]]) to capture the ruthless [[dacoit]] [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]] ([[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]]). [[Hema Malini]] and [[Jaya Bhaduri]] also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests, Basanti and Radha, respectively. ''Sholay'' is considered a classic and one of the best [[Cinema of India|Indian films]]. It was ranked first in the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2002 poll of \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the [[50th Filmfare Awards]] named it the [[Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years|Best Film of 50 Years]].\n\nThe film was shot in the rocky terrain of [[Ramanagara]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/the-hills-around-bengaluru-are-alive-with-the-sound-of-tourists/article29292458.ece|title=The hills around Bengaluru are alive with the sound of tourists|last=Prabhu|first=Nagesh|date=2019-08-29|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-02-03|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> in the [[South India|southern]] state of [[Karnataka]], over a span of two and a half years. After the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] mandated the removal of several violent scenes, ''Sholay'' was released with a length of 198&nbsp;minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204&nbsp;minutes became available on home media. When first released, ''Sholay'' received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. The film was also an [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|overseas success]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. It was the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian film]] ever at the time, and was the [[List of highest-grossing films in India|highest-grossing film in India]] up until ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994). By some accounts, ''Sholay'' remains the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe film is a [[Dacoit Western]] (sometimes called a \"[[Curry Western]]\"), combining the conventions of Indian [[dacoit film]]s with that of [[Spaghetti Western]]s along with elements of [[Samurai cinema]]. ''Sholay'' is also a defining example of the [[masala film]], which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, [[homosocial]] bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory.<ref>For glorification of violence, see Wimal Dissanayake, Malti Sahai, ''Sholay: A Cultural Reading (Delhi: Wiley Eastern, 1992), 115-19. {{ISBN|8122403948}}; for fuedal ethos, see Hrishikesh Ingle, \"Regionalist Disjuncture in Bollywood\", in Vikrant Kishore et al., eds., ''Salaam Bollywood: Representations and interpretations'' (London: Routledge, 2016), 202. {{ISBN|1317232852}}; on social order/disorder, see Dissanayake, \"The Concepts of Evil and Social Order in Indian Melodrama: An Evolving Dialect\", in ''Melodrama and Asian Cinema'', ed.

D. Burman]], and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural [[meme]]s and becoming part of India's daily [[vernacular]]. In January 2014, ''Sholay'' was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Baldev Singh summons a pair of small-time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo{{snd}}Veeru and Jai{{snd}}would be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh, a [[Dacoity|dacoit]] wanted by the authorities for a {{INR}}50,000{{efn|name=exchange|The exchange rate in 1975 was 8.94 Indian rupees ({{INR}}) per 1 US dollar (US$).{{sfn|Statistical Abstract of the United States|1977|p=917}}}} reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional {{INR}}20,000 reward.\n\nThe two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of [[Holi]]. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Though Thakur has a gun within his reach, he does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and had both his arms cut off a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a [[shawl]].\n\nLiving in Ramgarh, the jovial Veeru and cynical Jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers. Veeru is attracted to Basanti, a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse-cart. Jai is drawn to Radha, Thakur's reclusive, widowed daughter-in-law, who subtly returns his affections.\n\nSkirmishes between Gabbar's gang and Jai-Veeru finally result in the capture of Veeru and Basanti by the dacoits. Jai attacks the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition and also to drop Basanti at a safe place. Meanwhile, Jai, who is continuing the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range.\n\nVeeru returns, and Jai dies in his arms. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and catches the dacoit. Veeru nearly beats Gabbar to death when Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the promise to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and destroy his hands. The police then arrive and arrest Gabbar. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train. Radha is left alone again.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dharmendra]] as Veeru\n* [[Sanjeev Kumar]] as [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Baldev Singh\n* [[Hema Malini]] as Basanti\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Jai (Jaidev)\n* [[Jaya Bhaduri]] as Radha, Thakur's daughter-in-law\n* [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] as [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]]\n* [[Satyen Kappu]] as Ramlaal, Thakur's servant\n* [[A.

Asrani spiced up his character with some ideas about Hitler's speech delivery he had heard from a teacher in [[Film and Television Institute of India|FTII]].

He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini.{{sfn|Chopra|2000|pp=35\u201336}} Hema Malini was reluctant to play the role of a ''tangewali'', more so after Sippy told her that the film belongs to Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan, but she trusted Sippy to give her a meaty role, given that he had played a huge role in essaying her stardom.{{sfn|Chopra|2000|page=30}}\n\nDuring the film's production, four of the leads became romantically involved.<ref name=\"rediff1\" /> Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to shooting delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By the time of the film's release, she was pregnant with their son [[Abhishek Bachchan|Abhishek]]. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film ''[[Seeta Aur Geeta]]'' (1972), and used the location shoot of ''Sholay'' to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him to spend more time with her. The couple married five years after the film's release.{{sfn|Chopra|2000|pp=91\u2013105}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Ramdevarabetta.jpg|thumb|Ramdevarabetta, near the town of Ramanagara; much of ''Sholay'' was shot in rocky locations such as this.|alt=A rocky outcrop such as those used in filming Sholay]]\n\nMuch of ''Sholay'' was shot in the rocky terrain of [[Ramanagara]], a town near [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Ramgarh-of-Sholay-to-become-district/articleshow/2140172.cms? |title=Ramgarh of Sholay to become district |accessdate=23 December 2008 |date=22 June 2007 |work=The Times of India |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013005634/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Ramgarh-of-Sholay-to-become-district/articleshow/2140172.cms |archivedate=13 October 2015 }}</ref> The filmmakers had to build a road from the Bangalore highway to Ramanagara for convenient access to the sets.{{sfn|Chopra|2000|p=45}} Art director Ram Yedekar had an entire township built on the site.

Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society.{{sfn|Prasad|1998|pp=156\u2013160}} Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept [[Feudalism|feudal order]].{{sfn|Prasad|1998|pp=156\u2013160}} Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.{{sfn|Banerjea|2005|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\nGabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=199}} Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=199}} He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=200}} He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in ''Sholay'', the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=200}} Dissanayake argues that ''Sholay'' can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India.{{sfn|Dissanayake|1993|p=201}} The narrative style of ''Sholay'', with its violence, revenge, and [[vigilante]] action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in [[the Emergency (India)|the Emergency]] ([[rule by decree]]) declared by prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1975.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayward|1y=2006|1pp=63\u201364|2a1=Holtzman|2y=2011|2p=118}}\n\nDissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully \"Indianised\".{{sfnm|1a1=Dissanayake|1a2=Sahai|1y=1992|1p=125|2a1=Dissanayake|2y=1993|2p=197}} As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in ''Sholay'' with a similar scene in ''Once Upon a Time in the West''. Although both films were similar in technical style, ''Sholay'' emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach.{{sfn|Heide|2002|p=52}} Maithili Rao, in ''Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema'', notes that ''Sholay'' infuses the style of the Western genre into a \"feudalistic ethos\".{{sfn|Rao|2003|p=95}} Ted Shen of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' notes ''Sholay''{{'}}s \"hysterical visual style\" and intermittent \"populist message\".<ref name=\"shen chic reader\" /> Cultural critic and Islamic scholar [[Ziauddin Sardar]] lampoons the film in his book ''The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema'', both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers.{{sfn|Sardar|1998|pp=48\u201349}} Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam).
