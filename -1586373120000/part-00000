Rahman]] and lyrics by [[Vairamuthu]]. The film opened on 2 November 1994 as one among the Deepavali releases audio song released November 1994 and received critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is about a quasi-mother-son relationship between Pavithra ([[Raadhika Sarathkumar|Raadhika]]) and Ashok ([[Ajith Kumar]]). Ashok is a patient suffering from [[cancer]], and Pavithra is a nurse in the hospital where he is being treated. Since Ashok's age is same as her child (which was still born and died and she is childless), Pavithra showers maternal affection on him, which her husband mistakes as something else because of a villain doctor, who is a rogue. Confusion ensues, and Pavithra misunderstands Ashok.

The first European settlers in the area were mainly engaged in dairy farming or growing produce. By 1862, there were sixteen properties along what was then Cabbage Tree Swamp Road.<ref>{{cite news|title=Public Notification|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18620429.2.2.5|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=Daily Southern Cross|date=29 April 1862}}</ref> In 1877, Cabbage Tree Swamp residents successfully lobbied to have the road's name changed to Kingsland Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Dick|title=In Old Mount Albert|year=1983|publisher=Southern Cross Book|location=Auckland, NZ|edition=2nd enlarged|page=41}}</ref> The road and suburb were renamed again as Edendale in 1916, and finally as Sandringham in 1929.\n\nThrough the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the suburb grew slowly and remained mostly farmland and scrub.

Eden Park and Gribblehurst Park became lakes during heavy winter rain, as did the reserve land east of Sandringham Shops. After a heavy storm in 1919, locals recalled boating through the streets and floodwaters \"flowing through the bay windows\" of one low-lying house.<ref>{{cite news|title=[no title]|newspaper=Sandringham Star|date=May 1961|page=1}}</ref> Substantial development only came around 1925 with the construction of the tramline, resulting in the core of what is now the Sandringham Shopping Centre being built. Rows of evenly spaced streets spread on each side of Sandringham road and were lined with wooden [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] houses. Large parts of the area remained undeveloped however, and services such as telephone, electricity and gas were only provided at a minimum level.\n\nOver the following decades more retail buildings were constructed. Large-scale subdivision of farmland began in the 1920s, and [[California Bungalow|Californian bungalows]] began to dominate the architecture of the area. Around 1927, the Mayfair Cinema was built, an elegant building in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Neo-Greek]] style; it was demolished in the early 1990s. The Sandringham Service Station, still operating in 2011, was first erected by Sydney Waring in 1929.<ref name=\"Truttman 2008 24\">{{cite web|last=Truttman|first=Lisa|title=Sandringham Shopping Centre: character heritage study|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/district/updates/t132b/Sandringhamshoppingcentrecharacterstudy.pdf|publisher=Auckland City Council|accessdate=29 March 2011 |author2=Matthews & Matthews Architects Ltd |author3=R.A.

Sandringham Village is a virtually intact example of an interwar suburban shopping precinct.\n\nAs part of the [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden electorate]], Sandringham became a [[Prohibition|no-licence]] area from 1909 until 2000, meaning that alcohol could not be sold.

Large parts of the area remained undeveloped however, and services such as telephone, electricity and gas were only provided at a minimum level.\n\nOver the following decades more retail buildings were constructed. Large-scale subdivision of farmland began in the 1920s, and [[California Bungalow|Californian bungalows]] began to dominate the architecture of the area. Around 1927, the Mayfair Cinema was built, an elegant building in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Neo-Greek]] style; it was demolished in the early 1990s.

Part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] of the Andes, it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of {{convert|4670|m}} in a depression. The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several [[lava dome]]s.\n\nThe caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several [[ignimbrite]]s. A recent eruption occurred 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra P\u00f3mez ignimbrite layer. About 2,300 \u00b1 160 BCE,<ref name=GVP /> the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. Over {{convert|170|km3}} of [[tephra]] were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.\n\nThe volcano is also known for giant [[ripple marks]] that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures. These ripple marks have heights up to {{convert|1|m}} and are separated by distances up to {{convert|30|m}}. Unlike [[dune]]s, they do not migrate with the wind and are stationary. These ripple marks are among the most extreme on Earth and have been compared to [[Mars|Martian]] ripple marks by geologists.\n\n== Geography and geomorphology ==\n\nThe caldera lies at the southern margin of the Argentine [[Puna]]{{efn|The [[Altiplano]]-Puna is the second-largest [[high plateau]] on Earth after the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and consists of a number of [[mountain range]]s separated by valleys with [[closed drainage]].{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=138}} }},{{sfn|Kay|Coira|Mpodozis|2006|p=499}} on the border between the [[Antofagasta de la Sierra Department]] and the [[Tinogasta Department]]{{sfn|Ratto|Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez|Basile|P\u00e9rez Torrado|2018|p=76}} in the [[Catamarca Province]] of Argentina.{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|p=3}} [[Trail]]s run through the area,{{sfn|Milana|2009|p=343}} and there are abandoned [[mining]] operations.{{sfn|Milana|2009|p=344}} [[Provincial Route 34 (Catamarca)]] between [[Fiambal\u00e1]] and [[Antofagasta de la Sierra]] runs past Cerro Blanco.{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=140}} The volcano is sometimes known as Cerro Blanco and sometimes as Robledo,{{sfn|Pritchard|Simons|2004|p=10}} with the latter name used by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].{{sfn|Brunori|Bignami|Stramondo|Bustos|2013|p=279}}\n\n=== Calderas and lava domes ===\n\nCerro Blanco lies at an elevation of {{convert|3500|-|4700|m}} and consists of four nested calderas{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|pp=4-5}} with discontinuous borders,{{sfn|Seggiaro|Hongn|Castillo|Pereyra|2006|p=27}} fallout deposits, [[lava dome]]s{{sfn|Brunori|Bignami|Stramondo|Bustos|2013|p=281}} and [[pyroclastic]] deposits.{{sfn|Chiodi|Tassi|B\u00e1ez|Filipovich|2019|p=2}} The two inconspicuous El Ni\u00f1o and Pie de San Buenaventura calderas are nested in the northern part of the complex{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|pp=4-5}} and form a {{convert|15|km}} wide depression.{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=140}} Only their northern margins are recognizable in satellite images; their southern parts are filled with [[block and ash flow]]s from the southern calderas.

Part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] of the Andes, it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of {{convert|4670|m}} in a depression. The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several [[lava dome]]s.\n\nThe caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several [[ignimbrite]]s. A recent eruption occurred 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra P\u00f3mez ignimbrite layer. About 2,300 \u00b1 160 BCE,<ref name=GVP /> the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. Over {{convert|170|km3}} of [[tephra]] were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.\n\nThe volcano is also known for giant [[ripple marks]] that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures.

Wayne Reitz|Reitz]] in 1957.]]\n'''Florida Blue Key''' is a student leadership [[honor society]] at the [[University of Florida]] which was founded in 1923. \n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early years===\n[[Image:Aamurphree.jpg|right|150px|thumb|President [[Albert Murphree]]]]\n\"Florida Blue Key was founded on November 1, 1923, several days prior to the University's Homecoming celebration.  At the suggestion of President Albert E. Murphree, Bert C. Riley, Dean of General Extension, brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization which would recognize leadership and promote service to the University.  Among the duties assigned to Florida Blue Key were playing host to campus visitors and to be at the call of the President of the University for any duty designated by him.\n\nIn this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing Homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since.  Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad's Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life.  Dad's Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.\n\nThe organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInitially, membership in the organization was ''ex officio''; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.<ref name=\"auto\">Who's Who in Florida Blue Key; Volume XIII</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state's only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education.<ref>Pursuant to the [[Buckman Act]], adopted by the Florida Legislature in 1905, the [[University of Florida]] was reserved for white male students, [[Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]] was reserved for white female students, and [[Florida A & M University|Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]] was a coeducational institution for black students.</ref> During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida. If one of those leaders were college educated, it was most likely he went to the University of Florida and, to a large measure, it was consistent that student leaders at the University of Florida would likely remain in Florida and would assume roles of leadership within the professional, political, governmental, business, education cultural, religious, and social life of the state. The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida. While Florida Blue Key membership offered many opportunities for service to the University, it also provided opportunities for personal enhancement and advancement. Many doors were opened to young college graduates whose resume included membership in Florida Blue Key.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Separation with national chapters===\n\nThe concept of a group of student leaders pooling their talents and interests to plan and promote a major event for their campus was a popular idea.  Through Dean Riley's travels and professional contacts, similar organizations were developed on other campuses and it wasn't long before it seemed appropriate to organize into a national group.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the University of Florida chapter decided not to be part of the national organization between 1932 and 1935.  The Florida group thought the proposed Constitution of the national organization took too much control from the hands of the students; and it disagreed with some specific tenets of membership, including the requirement of a 2.5 grade point average.  The Florida group believed the organization was not an academic one but, rather, a leadership and service group; thus, if one was progressing satisfactorily toward a degree (i.e. 2.0), one should be eligible for membership. Since then, Florida Blue Key has changed its stance on the grade point average requirement, now requiring a 2.75 GPA in order to be tapped. The Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country. Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida. \n\nThe Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country.  Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida.  The dispute was a clear indication that FBK did not intend to serve as a passive honor for University of Florida students, but rather as an active force in shaping the events of the university and state.\n\nThe parting of the ways between the parent chapter and other chapters forming the national organization left deep wounds on many Florida students.  The perceptions of the conflict being a very important part of any subsequent discussions about the organization for years to come; including discussions of orientation of new members.  The active members at that time wanted nothing to do with the national organization once it was founded, and, further, wanted to be sure that their successors would not become involved in it.  Examples of such feelings are expressed in the last sentence of the Oath of Membership in Florida Blue Key and the Constitution.  Through the 1940s, the orientation of new members included hours on the discussion of this topic.\n\nToday, it is still part of the orientation, but only for the purposes of relating its historical significance and for emphasizing that Florida Blue Key is the name of the organization that it has no relationship to, and is not part of, The Blue Key National Honor Society.

Wayne Reitz|Reitz]] in 1957.]]\n'''Florida Blue Key''' is a student leadership [[honor society]] at the [[University of Florida]] which was founded in 1923. \n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\n[[Image:Aamurphree.jpg|right|150px|thumb|President [[Albert Murphree]]]]\n\"Florida Blue Key was founded on November 1, 1923, several days prior to the University's Homecoming celebration.  At the suggestion of President Albert E. Murphree, Bert C. Riley, Dean of General Extension, brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization which would recognize leadership and promote service to the University.  Among the duties assigned to Florida Blue Key were playing host to campus visitors and to be at the call of the President of the University for any duty designated by him.\n\nIn this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing Homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since.  Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad's Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life.  Dad's Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.\n\nThe organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInitially, membership in the organization was ''ex officio''; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.<ref name=\"auto\">Who's Who in Florida Blue Key; Volume XIII</ref>\n\n===Separation with national chapters===\n\nThe concept of a group of student leaders pooling their talents and interests to plan and promote a major event for their campus was a popular idea.  Through Dean Riley's travels and professional contacts, similar organizations were developed on other campuses and it wasn't long before it seemed appropriate to organize into a national group.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the University of Florida chapter decided not to be part of the national organization between 1932 and 1935.  The Florida group thought the proposed Constitution of the national organization took too much control from the hands of the students; and it disagreed with some specific tenets of membership, including the requirement of a 2.5 grade point average.  The Florida group believed the organization was not an academic one but, rather, a leadership and service group; thus, if one was progressing satisfactorily toward a degree (i.e. 2.0), one should be eligible for membership. Since then, Florida Blue Key has changed its stance on the grade point average requirement, now requiring a 2.75 GPA in order to be tapped. The Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country. Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida. \n\nThe Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country.  Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida.  The dispute was a clear indication that FBK did not intend to serve as a passive honor for University of Florida students, but rather as an active force in shaping the events of the university and state.\n\nThe parting of the ways between the parent chapter and other chapters forming the national organization left deep wounds on many Florida students.  The perceptions of the conflict being a very important part of any subsequent discussions about the organization for years to come; including discussions of orientation of new members.  The active members at that time wanted nothing to do with the national organization once it was founded, and, further, wanted to be sure that their successors would not become involved in it.  Examples of such feelings are expressed in the last sentence of the Oath of Membership in Florida Blue Key and the Constitution.  Through the 1940s, the orientation of new members included hours on the discussion of this topic.\n\nToday, it is still part of the orientation, but only for the purposes of relating its historical significance and for emphasizing that Florida Blue Key is the name of the organization that it has no relationship to, and is not part of, The Blue Key National Honor Society.  A transfer student to the University of Florida often assumes his membership in a Blue Key National Honor Society chapter at another institution provides him with reciprocal membership in Florida Blue Key only to find out that is not the case.   To this day, Florida Blue Key controls the use of all trademark and intellectual property rights related to Blue Key.  Furthermore, Blue Key National Honor Society is prohibited from chartering or forming chapters at any institution within the State of Florida.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Uniqueness and influence===\nFlorida Blue Key is one of the most unusual student organizations in American higher education. In the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state's only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education.<ref>Pursuant to the [[Buckman Act]], adopted by the Florida Legislature in 1905, the [[University of Florida]] was reserved for white male students, [[Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]] was reserved for white female students, and [[Florida A & M University|Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]] was a coeducational institution for black students.</ref> During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida. If one of those leaders were college educated, it was most likely he went to the University of Florida and, to a large measure, it was consistent that student leaders at the University of Florida would likely remain in Florida and would assume roles of leadership within the professional, political, governmental, business, education cultural, religious, and social life of the state. The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida. While Florida Blue Key membership offered many opportunities for service to the University, it also provided opportunities for personal enhancement and advancement. Many doors were opened to young college graduates whose resume included membership in Florida Blue Key.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Current responsibilities===\n[[Image:Miss UF.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Miss University of Florida]] in 1958]]\nThe organization continues to sponsor and organize the University of Florida's annual [[Homecoming]] celebration and Gator Growl.

The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} -->\nA legend tells of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands.

The problem with this assumption is that ''kilima'' actually means hill and is, therefore, the [[diminutive]] of ''mlima'', the proper Kiswahili word for mountain. However, \"[i]t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor, whose knowledge of [Kiswahili] was not extensive, changed ''mlima'' to ''kilima'' by analogy with the two [[Chaga languages|Wachagga]] names: ''Kibo'' and ''Kimawenzi''.\"<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/> A different approach is to assume that the kileman part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga ''kileme'', which means that which defeats, or ''kilelema'', which means that which has become difficult or impossible.

Considering that the name Kilimanjaro has never been current among the [[Chaga people|Wachagga people]], it is possible that the name was derived from Wachagga saying that the mountain was unclimbable, ''kilemanjaare'' or ''kilemajyaro'', and porters misinterpreting this as being the name of the mountain.<ref name=\"Hutchinson\"/>\n\nIn the 1880s, the mountain became a part of [[German East Africa]] and was called Kilima-Ndscharo in German following the Kiswahili name components.<ref>Briggs, Philip (1996): \"Guide to Tanzania; 2nd edition.\" Bradt Guides.</ref> On 6 October 1889, [[Hans Meyer (geologist)|Hans Meyer]] reached the highest summit on the crater ridge of Kibo.

A few years later James Charles Stuart Strange was born. James attended the [[College of Navarre]] in Paris in 1770.<ref name=parliament/>\n\n==East India Company==\nIn 1772 James Strange obtained a [[East India Company#Writers|writership]] with the [[East India Company]] (EIC), in [[Chennai|Madras]], [[India]]. He gained this post through [[Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet|Sir Lawrence Dundas]], a relative of Strange's maternal grandmother.<ref name=parliament/> Like many members of former Jacobite families, James Strange and his brother Thomas Strange made their way to India, arriving in 1773. James advanced rapidly in the EIC and in private trade.<ref name=walker/> In 1778 he became a [[Factor (agent)|Factor]] of the EIC.<ref name=parliament/>\n\nIn 1780 Strange returned to England, having made a fortune. He was promoted to a Junior Merchant of the EIC in 1782.<ref name=parliament/> On February 18, 1785, Strange married Margaret Durham. The same year he returned to India with his new bride.<ref name=parliament/>\n\nFrom late 1785 to early 1787 he undertook a voyage to the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast, hoping to be the first to capitalize on the nascent [[maritime fur trade]]. Afterward he returned to India and continued his career with the EIC. He was promoted to Senior Merchant in 1790.<ref name=parliament/> In 1795 he was appointed Collector and Paymaster for the EIC in [[Thanjavur|Tanjore]], India. Later that year he retired from the East India Company and returned to England.<ref name=parliament/>\n\nLater he rejoined the EIC and became Magistrate Collector in [[Puducherry]] (Pondichery), in 1806, then Judge of Court of Appeal, in 1807. From 1813 to 1815 he served the EIC as Postmaster General and a Senior Member of the Board of Trade. In 1816 he retired and returned to Great Britain.<ref name=parliament/> On the voyage home he stopped at [[Saint Helena]] where he won a game of [[piquet]] with the exiled [[Napoleon]].<ref name=parliament/>\n\n==Voyage to the Pacific Northwest==\nIn 1785 while returning to India after marrying Margaret Durham, Strange read newly published accounts of the [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage of Captain Cook]],<ref name=\"Walker, p. 9\">Walker, p. 9</ref> including news of the large profits made by his crew in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), China, selling [[sea otter]] furs they had obtained at [[Nootka Sound]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast.<ref name=gough>{{cite book|last=Gough|first=Barry M.|title=The Northwest Coast: British Navigation, Trade and Discoveries to 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaazLIC7lgC&pg=PA78|accessdate=25 August 2017|year=2011|publisher=University of British Columbia Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4292-1|pages=78\u201382}}</ref> Captain [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]], who had helped take over after the death of Cook, wrote of the possible profits to be made selling northwest coast furs in China.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nUpon Strange's return to India and the [[East India Company]] (EIC) in later 1785, he discussed the idea of an expedition with [[David Scott (of Dunninald)|David Scott]], a prominent [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) merchant. Scott and his two partners, Tate and Adamson, obtained the support of the president and council of the East India Company in Bombay for an expedition of two ships from [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) to the Northwest Coast of America. Strange invested 10,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] in the venture, which he borrowed from David Scott.<ref name=gough/> Overall the cost of fitting out the expedition rose to the point where only a major success in fur trading could possibly pay back investments, let alone make a profit.<ref name=\"Walker, p. 9\"/>\n\nTwo Bombay-built, copper-hulled [[Snow (ship)|snows]] were purchased. They were the ''Captain Cook'' of 350 [[Tonnage|tons]], and the ''Experiment'' of 100 tons. The ''Captain Cook'' was commanded by Henry Laurie, and the ''Experiment'' by Henry Guise. Strange was [[supercargo]] and also in overall command of the voyage. As far as the EIC was concerned, Strange was a company servant in command of a company-sanctioned, private project that, it was hoped, would lead not only to the discovery of new channels of commerce but also forestall rival attempts.<ref name=gough/>\n\nStrange's instructions from the East India Company described two main purposes for the expedition. First, exploration for the benefit of navigation. This included instructions to return via [[Bering Strait]], the [[Arctic Ocean]] as far as the North Pole, then [[Kamchatka]], then [[China]].<ref name=gough/> Second, the establishment of a new channel of commerce from the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast to China and India. Despite these instructions, the actual voyage was a commercial fur-trading venture no different from other early [[maritime fur trade|maritime fur trading]] expeditions to the Northwest Coast.<ref name=day>{{cite book|last=Day|first=Alan|title=Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Northwest Passage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q20QAJEDcScC&pg=PA275|accessdate=25 August 2017|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6519-8|page=275}}</ref>\n\nStrange's expedition left Bombay in December, 1785. Unable to acquire goods on the Malabar Coast for trade in [[Macau]], Strange sailed directly for the Pacific Northwest.<ref name=gough/> The ''Experiment'' was holed while still in the [[Indian Ocean]], forcing a stop at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) for repairs, costing time and money.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nAfter a seven-month voyage the expedition arrived on the coast of [[Vancouver Island]] on June 25, 1786 late in the trading season. On the 28th Strange entered [[Nootka Sound]], but not the way he intended. It took nine more days to reach [[Yuquot]], which was where Captain Cook had anchored.<ref name=gough/> Strange named the harbor at Yuquot \"Friendly Cove\", a name which persisted for a long time.<ref name=lang/> He spent about a month trading for furs around Nootka Sound with the native Nuu-chah-nulth. Strange conducted the trading negotiations himself and, like other traders, found the Nuu-chah-nulth very shrewd traders.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nBeyond trading negotiations, Strange did not interact with the natives very much. Alexander Walker, an ensign of the [[Bombay Army]] and later [[Governor of Saint Helena]], who had shipped aboard the ''Experiment'', spent a great deal of time with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He had studied the language based on Cook's vocabularies, was able to talk with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He was astonished to learn that the British fur trader [[James Hanna (trader)|James Hanna]] had been at Nootka Sound a year before. Up until then Strange and his crew thought themselves the first fur traders on the Northwest Coast. Walker wrote favorably of chiefs [[Maquinna]] and [[Callicum]], who later came to figure prominently in the [[Nootka Crisis]].<ref name=gough/> Both Walker and Strange were confused about the rank of Maquinna and Callicum and generally about the Nuu-chah-nulth's system of social hierarchy. Maquinna was the highest ranked chief of the highest ranked [[House society|house]], while Callicum was the leading chief of the second ranking house. The visitors did not understand these things. Walker and Strange both showed preference to Callicum, and Strange made the mistake of giving gifts to Callicum before Maquinna. These things offended Maquinna and caused tension and uneasiness, which Walker failed to understand. Still, Walker's descriptions of the Nuu-chah-nulth are valuable as the earliest detailed documentation, other than Captain Cook's 1778 journal, since no first-hand account of Hanna's 1785 stay at Nootka Sound survives.<ref name=walker1421>Walker, p. 14-21</ref>\n\nStrange had been instructed to establish a trading relationship with the natives. To this end he left [[John Mackay (surgeon)|John Mackay]], assistant surgeon of the ''Experiment'', at Nootka Sound. Strange hoped to make a second expedition, which would benefit from Mackay's time at Nootka Sound, but a second expedition never happened.<ref name=walker1421/> Mackay remained with Maquinna's Nuu-chah-nulth for about a year. At first Mackay was quite satisfied, but one day he accidentally broke a taboo that earned him the wrath of Maquinna, after which Mackay was poorly treated and spent a miserable winter. In June 1787 [[Charles William Barkley]] arrived at Friendly Cove in the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]''. Mackay helped Barkley gain 700 sea otter pelts from the Nuu-chah-nulth. In August another maritime fur trader, [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|George Dixon]], arrived in the ''King George''. Mackay, eager to leave, shipped out with Dixon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackay_john_4E.html |title=Mackay, John |last=Bumsted |first=J.M. |publisher= University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval |website= Dictionary of Canadian Biography |date=1988 |accessdate= 25 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=gough/>\n\nLeaving Mackay behind, Strange left Nootka Sound in late July, 1786, sailing north. He stopped near the northern end of Vancouver Island, which he named [[Cape Scott]], after David Scott, his patron in Mumbai (Bombay).<ref>{{BCGNIS|40836|Cape Scott}}</ref> He found and named the [[Scott Islands]].<ref name=lang/> Strange explored the waters north of Vancouver Island, which he named [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]]. Contact was made with a group of [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] off the north coast of Vancouver<ref name=walker1421/> Continuing east and south around Vancouver Island Strange noted the more constricted waters of [[Queen Charlotte Strait]]. Strange's discovery of Queen Charlotte Strait revived speculation about Bartolome de Fonte's alleged [[Northwest Passage]]. Strange himself thought he had found the entrance to the fabled strait, but fur trading took priority and he did investigate.<ref name=Pethick>{{cite book|last=Pethick|first=Derek|title=First Approaches to the Northwest Coast|year=1976|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|isbn=978-0-88894-056-8|pages=80\u201391}}</ref><ref name=day/> Furs were not plentiful in this area, so Strange sailed north, making for [[Prince William Sound]] in [[Alaska]], as Cook had done.\n\nOn the way north land was sighted, probably [[Haida Gwaii]], but Strange kept far to sea and passed by. On August 29, 1786, [[Hinchinbrook Island (Alaska)|Cape Hinchinbrook]], the entrance to Prince William Sound, was sighted. The two ships entered and sailed to Snug Corner Cove, where Cook had anchored. They stayed for about two weeks, until September 16.<ref name=walker1421/> Strange tried to acquire furs but it was late in the season and there was little to be had.<ref name=canadian/> Additionally, the natives were far less enthusiastic about trade than the Nuu-chah-nulth.<ref name=walker1421/>\n\nWhile at Prince William Sound Strange was joined by William Tipping of the ''Sea Otter''. After their encounter, Tipping's ''Sea Otter'' was never seen again. It might have been attacked and destroyed, or it might have been lost at sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/kefj/hrs/hrs3.htm |title= Chapter 3: European Exploration and Russian Settlement Patterns on the Lower Kenai Peninsula |publisher= [[National Park Service]] |accessdate= 25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn September, 1786, Strange left Prince William Sound and sailed to Canton, China. He sold his furs for about \u00a35,600, which was not nearly enough to cover the expenses of the expedition, nor even his own personal investment.<ref name=canadian/> Although his venture was a financial disaster, Strange was one of the first trader-explorers working on Pacific Northwest Coast, along with [[James Hanna (trader)|James Hanna]], [[Charles William Barkley]], and [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|George Dixon]].<ref name=lang>{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=William L.|last2=Walker|first2=James V.|title=Explorers of the Maritime Pacific Northwest: Mapping the World through Primary Documents: Mapping the World through Primary Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nH0CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA117|accessdate=25 August 2017|year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-926-6|pages=117, 192}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1796 James Strange, a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], became a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) as a guest of [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]], a silent supporter of [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt's]] administration.

A few years later James Charles Stuart Strange was born. James attended the [[College of Navarre]] in Paris in 1770.<ref name=parliament/>\n\n==East India Company==\nIn 1772 James Strange obtained a [[East India Company#Writers|writership]] with the [[East India Company]] (EIC), in [[Chennai|Madras]], [[India]]. He gained this post through [[Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet|Sir Lawrence Dundas]], a relative of Strange\u2019s maternal grandmother.<ref name=parliament/> Like many members of former Jacobite families, James Strange and his brother Thomas Strange made their way to India, arriving in 1773. James advanced rapidly in the EIC and in private trade.<ref name=walker/> In 1778 he became a [[Factor (agent)|Factor]] of the EIC.<ref name=parliament/>\n\nIn 1780 Strange returned to England, having made a fortune. He was promoted to a Junior Merchant of the EIC in 1782.<ref name=parliament/> On February 18, 1785, Strange married Margaret Durham. The same year he returned to India with his new bride.<ref name=parliament/>\n\nFrom late 1785 to early 1787 he undertook a voyage to the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast, hoping to be the first to capitalize on the nascent [[maritime fur trade]]. Afterward he returned to India and continued his career with the EIC. He was promoted to Senior Merchant in 1790.<ref name=parliament/> In 1795 he was appointed Collector and Paymaster for the EIC in [[Thanjavur|Tanjore]], India. Later that year he retired from the East India Company and returned to England.<ref name=parliament/>\n\nLater he rejoined the EIC and became Magistrate Collector in [[Puducherry]] (Pondichery), in 1806, then Judge of Court of Appeal, in 1807. From 1813 to 1815 he served the EIC as Postmaster General and a Senior Member of the Board of Trade. In 1816 he retired and returned to Great Britain.<ref name=parliament/> On the voyage home he stopped at [[Saint Helena]] where he won a game of [[piquet]] with the exiled [[Napoleon]].<ref name=parliament/>\n\n==Voyage to the Pacific Northwest==\nIn 1785 while returning to India after marrying Margaret Durham, Strange read newly published accounts of the [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage of Captain Cook]],<ref name=\"Walker, p. 9\">Walker, p. 9</ref> including news of the large profits made by his crew in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), China, selling [[sea otter]] furs they had obtained at [[Nootka Sound]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast.<ref name=gough>{{cite book|last=Gough|first=Barry M.|title=The Northwest Coast: British Navigation, Trade and Discoveries to 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaazLIC7lgC&pg=PA78|accessdate=25 August 2017|year=2011|publisher=University of British Columbia Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4292-1|pages=78\u201382}}</ref> Captain [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]], who had helped take over after the death of Cook, wrote of the possible profits to be made selling northwest coast furs in China.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nUpon Strange's return to India and the [[East India Company]] (EIC) in later 1785, he discussed the idea of an expedition with [[David Scott (of Dunninald)|David Scott]], a prominent [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) merchant. Scott and his two partners, Tate and Adamson, obtained the support of the president and council of the East India Company in Bombay for an expedition of two ships from [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) to the Northwest Coast of America. Strange invested 10,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] in the venture, which he borrowed from David Scott.<ref name=gough/> Overall the cost of fitting out the expedition rose to the point where only a major success in fur trading could possibly pay back investments, let alone make a profit.<ref name=\"Walker, p. 9\"/>\n\nTwo Bombay-built, copper-hulled [[Snow (ship)|snows]] were purchased. They were the ''Captain Cook'' of 350 [[Tonnage|tons]], and the ''Experiment'' of 100 tons. The ''Captain Cook'' was commanded by Henry Laurie, and the ''Experiment'' by Henry Guise. Strange was [[supercargo]] and also in overall command of the voyage. As far as the EIC was concerned, Strange was a company servant in command of a company-sanctioned, private project that, it was hoped, would lead not only to the discovery of new channels of commerce but also forestall rival attempts.<ref name=gough/>\n\nStrange's instructions from the East India Company described two main purposes for the expedition. First, exploration for the benefit of navigation. This included instructions to return via [[Bering Strait]], the [[Arctic Ocean]] as far as the North Pole, then [[Kamchatka]], then [[China]].<ref name=gough/> Second, the establishment of a new channel of commerce from the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast to China and India. Despite these instructions, the actual voyage was a commercial fur-trading venture no different from other early [[maritime fur trade|maritime fur trading]] expeditions to the Northwest Coast.<ref name=day>{{cite book|last=Day|first=Alan|title=Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Northwest Passage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q20QAJEDcScC&pg=PA275|accessdate=25 August 2017|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6519-8|page=275}}</ref>\n\nStrange's expedition left Bombay in December, 1785. Unable to acquire goods on the Malabar Coast for trade in [[Macau]], Strange sailed directly for the Pacific Northwest.<ref name=gough/> The ''Experiment'' was holed while still in the [[Indian Ocean]], forcing a stop at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) for repairs, costing time and money.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nAfter a seven-month voyage the expedition arrived on the coast of [[Vancouver Island]] on June 25, 1786 late in the trading season. On the 28th Strange entered [[Nootka Sound]], but not the way he intended. It took nine more days to reach [[Yuquot]], which was where Captain Cook had anchored.<ref name=gough/> Strange named the harbor at Yuquot \"Friendly Cove\", a name which persisted for a long time.<ref name=lang/> He spent about a month trading for furs around Nootka Sound with the native Nuu-chah-nulth. Strange conducted the trading negotiations himself and, like other traders, found the Nuu-chah-nulth very shrewd traders.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nBeyond trading negotiations, Strange did not interact with the natives very much. Alexander Walker, an ensign of the [[Bombay Army]] and later [[Governor of Saint Helena]], who had shipped aboard the ''Experiment'', spent a great deal of time with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He had studied the language based on Cook's vocabularies, was able to talk with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He was astonished to learn that the British fur trader [[James Hanna (trader)|James Hanna]] had been at Nootka Sound a year before. Up until then Strange and his crew thought themselves the first fur traders on the Northwest Coast. Walker wrote favorably of chiefs [[Maquinna]] and [[Callicum]], who later came to figure prominently in the [[Nootka Crisis]].<ref name=gough/> Both Walker and Strange were confused about the rank of Maquinna and Callicum and generally about the Nuu-chah-nulth's system of social hierarchy. Maquinna was the highest ranked chief of the highest ranked [[House society|house]], while Callicum was the leading chief of the second ranking house. The visitors did not understand these things. Walker and Strange both showed preference to Callicum, and Strange made the mistake of giving gifts to Callicum before Maquinna. These things offended Maquinna and caused tension and uneasiness, which Walker failed to understand. Still, Walker's descriptions of the Nuu-chah-nulth are valuable as the earliest detailed documentation, other than Captain Cook's 1778 journal, since no first-hand account of Hanna's 1785 stay at Nootka Sound survives.<ref name=walker1421>Walker, p. 14-21</ref>\n\nStrange had been instructed to establish a trading relationship with the natives. To this end he left [[John Mackay (surgeon)|John Mackay]], assistant surgeon of the ''Experiment'', at Nootka Sound. Strange hoped to make a second expedition, which would benefit from Mackay's time at Nootka Sound, but a second expedition never happened.<ref name=walker1421/> Mackay remained with Maquinna's Nuu-chah-nulth for about a year. At first Mackay was quite satisfied, but one day he accidentally broke a taboo that earned him the wrath of Maquinna, after which Mackay was poorly treated and spent a miserable winter. In June 1787 [[Charles William Barkley]] arrived at Friendly Cove in the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]''. Mackay helped Barkley gain 700 sea otter pelts from the Nuu-chah-nulth. In August another maritime fur trader, [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|George Dixon]], arrived in the ''King George''. Mackay, eager to leave, shipped out with Dixon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackay_john_4E.html |title=Mackay, John |last=Bumsted |first=J.M. |publisher= University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval |website= Dictionary of Canadian Biography |date=1988 |accessdate= 25 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=gough/>\n\nLeaving Mackay behind, Strange left Nootka Sound in late July, 1786, sailing north. He stopped near the northern end of Vancouver Island, which he named [[Cape Scott]], after David Scott, his patron in Mumbai (Bombay).<ref>{{BCGNIS|40836|Cape Scott}}</ref> He found and named the [[Scott Islands]].<ref name=lang/> Strange explored the waters north of Vancouver Island, which he named [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]]. Contact was made with a group of [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] off the north coast of Vancouver<ref name=walker1421/> Continuing east and south around Vancouver Island Strange noted the more constricted waters of [[Queen Charlotte Strait]]. Strange's discovery of Queen Charlotte Strait revived speculation about Bartolome de Fonte's alleged [[Northwest Passage]]. Strange himself thought he had found the entrance to the fabled strait, but fur trading took priority and he did investigate.<ref name=Pethick>{{cite book|last=Pethick|first=Derek|title=First Approaches to the Northwest Coast|year=1976|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|isbn=978-0-88894-056-8|pages=80\u201391}}</ref><ref name=day/> Furs were not plentiful in this area, so Strange sailed north, making for [[Prince William Sound]] in [[Alaska]], as Cook had done.\n\nOn the way north land was sighted, probably [[Haida Gwaii]], but Strange kept far to sea and passed by. On August 29, 1786, [[Hinchinbrook Island (Alaska)|Cape Hinchinbrook]], the entrance to Prince William Sound, was sighted. The two ships entered and sailed to Snug Corner Cove, where Cook had anchored. They stayed for about two weeks, until September 16.<ref name=walker1421/> Strange tried to acquire furs but it was late in the season and there was little to be had.<ref name=canadian/> Additionally, the natives were far less enthusiastic about trade than the Nuu-chah-nulth.<ref name=walker1421/>\n\nWhile at Prince William Sound Strange was joined by William Tipping of the ''Sea Otter''. After their encounter, Tipping's ''Sea Otter'' was never seen again. It might have been attacked and destroyed, or it might have been lost at sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/kefj/hrs/hrs3.htm |title= Chapter 3: European Exploration and Russian Settlement Patterns on the Lower Kenai Peninsula |publisher= [[National Park Service]] |accessdate= 25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn September, 1786, Strange left Prince William Sound and sailed to Canton, China. He sold his furs for about \u00a35,600, which was not nearly enough to cover the expenses of the expedition, nor even his own personal investment.<ref name=canadian/> Although his venture was a financial disaster, Strange was one of the first trader-explorers working on Pacific Northwest Coast, along with [[James Hanna (trader)|James Hanna]], [[Charles William Barkley]], and [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|George Dixon]].<ref name=lang>{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=William L.|last2=Walker|first2=James V.|title=Explorers of the Maritime Pacific Northwest: Mapping the World through Primary Documents: Mapping the World through Primary Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nH0CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA117|accessdate=25 August 2017|year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-926-6|pages=117, 192}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1796 James Strange, a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], became a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) as a guest of [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]], a silent supporter of [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt's]] administration.

He was returned for Oxford in [[1774 British general election|1774]] and [[1780 British general election|1780]].  Spencer was an inveterate gambler and having lost his official salary found himself in financial difficulties around 1781, until he was admitted to a twelfth share in [[Charles James Fox|Fox]]\u2019s [[faro (card game)|faro]] bank at [[Brooks's]], with a fee of five or six guineas an hour.

He remained active in fund-raising appeals for the party for many years afterwards. In consequence the Duke of Marlborough replaced him as candidate for Oxford in 1790. Fox may have intended a seat for Winchelsea for him, but nothing transpired. He did not want to spent \u00a33,000 to buy a seat at Wootton Bassett or risk an expensive contest at Evesham,and did not want to be a liability on his party.[[File:Woolbeding House DSC 2033.jpg|thumb|left|Woolbeding House]] He maintained a vain hope that the family interest would be available at Oxford, but it was not.

He resigned his seat in February 1799.<ref name= HOP2/>\n\nIn March 1802 a vacancy arose for Spencer at [[Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)|Tavistock]] and he was elected at a by-election on 25 March 1802. In August 1802 he went to Paris with Fox, and met [[Napoleon]] with whom he discussed his great ancestor. Later when Napoleon was at St Helena Spencer sent him a  biography of Marlborough.  He was returned for Tavistock in the [[1802 United Kingdom general election|1802]]  and  [[1806 United Kingdom general election|1806 general election]]s. He was [[Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chases]] from  February 1806 to March 1807.

He was appointed a [[Lords of Trade|Lord of Trade]] in April 1770 but did not attend the Board regularly nor parliament itself. He resigned his seat in January 1771 and was elected MP for [[Oxford (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford]] in a by election on 31 January 1771. He was returned for Oxford in [[1774 British general election|1774]] and [[1780 British general election|1780]].  Spencer was an inveterate gambler and having lost his official salary found himself in financial difficulties around 1781, until he was admitted to a twelfth share in [[Charles James Fox|Fox]]\u2019s [[faro (card game)|faro]] bank at [[Brooks's]], with a fee of five or six guineas an hour. He was an ardent supporter of Fox throughout his career and after.

He remained active in fund-raising appeals for the party for many years afterwards. In consequence the Duke of Marlborough replaced him as candidate for Oxford in 1790. Fox may have intended a seat for Winchelsea for him, but nothing transpired. He did not want to spent \u00a33,000 to buy a seat at Wootton Bassett or risk an expensive contest at Evesham,and did not want to be a liability on his party.[[File:Woolbeding House DSC 2033.jpg|thumb|left|Woolbeding House]] He maintained a vain hope that the family interest would be available at Oxford, but it was not.

However, he was in financial difficulties in 1799 and lost through gambling again so heavily that he had to sell his London house and pictures. He resigned his seat in February 1799.<ref name= HOP2/>\n\nIn March 1802 a vacancy arose for Spencer at [[Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)|Tavistock]] and he was elected at a by-election on 25 March 1802. In August 1802 he went to Paris with Fox, and met [[Napoleon]] with whom he discussed his great ancestor. Later when Napoleon was at St Helena Spencer sent him a  biography of Marlborough.  He was returned for Tavistock in the [[1802 United Kingdom general election|1802]]  and  [[1806 United Kingdom general election|1806 general election]]s. He was [[Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chases]] from  February 1806 to March 1807. When Fox died his political raison d\u2019\u00eatre was gone and he gave up  his seat at [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807]]. He never ceased to lament and praise Fox.<ref name = HOP2/>\n\nSpencer married his mistress Harriet Bouverie on 2 October 1811, a year after the death of her husband. He  resumed his seat for Tavistock in 1817 as a stopgap for the Duke of Bedford when Lord John Russell vacated the seat through illness and was returned in a by-election on 12 March 1817.  Similarly he stood in for his own family at Woodstock in the [[1818 United Kingdom general election|1818 general election]] although his nephew the Duke of Marlborough withdrew him from Woodstock in [[1820 United Kingdom general election|1820]].<ref name = HOP2/>\n\nSpencer retired to Woolbeding which he had tastefully embellished. He died on 23 June 1831, \u201ca venerable grave old man\u201d.
