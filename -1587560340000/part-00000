Along with van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Husz\u00e1r]], [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[Jacobus Oud|J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''Neoplasticism''\u2014the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).\n\nAccording to Theo van Doesburg in the introduction of the magazine \"De Stijl\" 1917 no.1, the \"De Stijl\"-movement was a reaction to the \"Modern Baroque\" of the [[Amsterdam School]] movement ([[Expressionist architecture|Dutch expressionist architecture]]) with the magazine \"[[Wendingen]]\" (1918\u20131931).\n\n== Principles and influences ==\n[[File:Destijl anthologiebonset.jpg|thumb|right|''De Stijl'' November 1921, [[Dadaism]] ]]\n[[File:Manifest I of De Stijl.JPG|thumb|right|De Stijl Manifesto I, November 1918]]\n[[File:Rietveld chair 1bb.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Red and Blue Chair]]'', designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]], version without colors 1919, version with colors 1923]]\n[[File:RietveldSchroederhuis.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House]] in [[Utrecht]], 1924 \u2013 the only building realised completely according to the principles of \"De Stijl\"]]\n[[File:Aubette Cin\u00e9-dancing 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubette (building)|Aubette dance hall]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[Theo van Doesburg]] in collaboration with [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]] and [[Jean Arp]], 1929]]\n\nMondrian sets forth the delimitations of Neoplasticism in his essay \"Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art\". He writes, \"this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour\". With these constraints, his art allows only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/n/neo-plasticism|title=Neo-plasticism \u2013 Art Term \u2013 Tate|last=Tate|publisher=}}</ref> The De Stijl movement posited the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description/|title=The Solomon R.

The \"plastic vision\" of De Stijl artists, also called Neo-Plasticism, saw itself as reaching beyond the changing appearance of natural things to bring an audience into intimate contact with an immutable core of reality, a reality that was not so much a visible fact as an underlying spiritual vision.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Denker|first1=Susan A.|title=De Stijl: 1917\u20131931, Visions of Utopia|journal=Art Journal|date=September 1982|volume=42|issue=3|pages=242\u2013246|doi=10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803}}</ref> In general, De Stijl proposed ultimate simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]], and the three primary values, [[black]], [[white]], and [[grey]]. The works avoided symmetry and attained aesthetic balance by the use of opposition. This element of the movement embodies the second meaning of ''stijl'': \"a post, jamb or support\"; this is best exemplified by the construction of crossing joints, most commonly seen in [[carpentry]].\n\nIn many of the group's three-dimensional works, vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. This feature can be found in the [[Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House]] and the [[Red and Blue Chair]].\n\nDe Stijl was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about \"ideal\" geometric forms (such as the \"perfect straight line\") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of mathematician [[M.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by [[Neopositivism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=978-0-13-062084-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/artpastartpresen0002wilk/page/523 523]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/artpastartpresen0002wilk/page/523}}</ref>  The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, unlike the other \"-ism\" movements (e.g., [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]]) Neoplasticism was a collective project, a joint enterprise, nor would it adhere to the principles of the Bauhaus even though Van Doesburg had links to the art school through its principal [[Walter Gropius]].\n\nIn [[music]], De Stijl was an influence only on the work of composer [[Jakob van Domselaer]], a close friend of Mondrian. Between 1913 and 1916, he composed his ''Proeven van Stijlkunst'' (\"Experiments in Artistic Style\"), inspired mainly by Mondrian's paintings. This [[minimalist]]ic\u2014and, at the time, revolutionary\u2014music defined \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" musical elements and aimed at balancing those two principles. Van Domselaer was relatively unknown in his lifetime, and did not play a significant role within De Stijl.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nFrom the flurry of new art movements that followed the [[Impressionist]] revolutionary new perception of painting, [[Cubism]] arose in the early 20th century as an important and influential new direction. In the [[Netherlands]], too, there was interest in this \"new art\".\n\nHowever, because the Netherlands remained neutral in [[World War&nbsp;I]], Dutch artists were not able to leave the country after 1914 and were thus effectively isolated from the international art world\u2014and in particular, from [[Paris]], which was its centre then.\n\nDuring that period, Theo van Doesburg started looking for other artists to set up a [[Literary magazine|journal]] and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more successful writing about art than working as an independent artist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Theo van Doesburg|editor1-last=Translated by Janet Seligman|editor2-last=Introd. by Hans M.

He first met [[Piet Mondrian]] at an exhibition in [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Mondrian, who had moved to Paris in 1912 (and there, changed his name from \"Mondriaan\"), had been visiting the Netherlands when war broke out. He could not return to Paris, and was staying in the artists' community of [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], where he met [[Bart van der Leck]] and regularly saw [[M.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. In 1915, Schoenmaekers published ''Het nieuwe wereldbeeld'' (\"The New Image of the World\"), followed in 1916 by ''Beginselen der beeldende wiskunde'' (\"Principles of Plastic Mathematics\"). These two publications would greatly influence Mondrian and other members of De Stijl.\n\nVan Doesburg also knew [[J.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;P. Oud]] and the Hungarian artist [[Vilmos Husz\u00e1r]]. In 1917 the cooperation of these artists, together with the poet [[Anthony Kok]], resulted in the founding of De Stijl. The young architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]] joined the group in 1918.  At its height De Stijl had 100 members and the journal had a circulation of 300.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dujardin|first1=Alain|last2=Quirindongo|first2=Jop|title=This 100-Year-Old Dutch Movement Shaped Web Design Today|url=https://backchannel.com/100-years-of-clean-lines-how-de-stijl-is-influencing-digital-design-4397f1a72e37?curator=MediaREDEF#.kphtjs1er|journal=[[Backchannel (blog)]]|accessdate=29 January 2017|date=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nDuring those first few years, the group was still relatively homogeneous, although Van der Leck left in 1918 due to artistic differences of opinion. [[Manifesto]]s were being published, signed by all members. The social and economic circumstances of the time formed an important source of inspiration for their theories, and their ideas about architecture were heavily influenced by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].\n\nThe name ''Nieuwe Beelding'' was a term first coined in 1917 by Mondrian, who wrote a series of twelve articles called ''De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst'' (\"Neo-Plasticism in Painting\") that were published in the journal ''De Stijl''. In 1920 he published a book titled ''Le N\u00e9o-Plasticisme''.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/mondrian1920/0005 Piet Mondrian, ''Le N\u00e9o-Plasticisme, Principe G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Equivalence Plastique'', Paris, 1920], Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Heidelberg</ref>\n\n=== After 1920 ===\n[[File:Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior 1919.jpg|thumb|Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior, c.1919, [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Amsterdam]]]]\nAround 1921, the group's character started to change. From the time of van Doesburg's association with [[Bauhaus]], other influences started playing a role. These influences were mainly [[Malevich]] and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], to which not all members agreed. In 1924 Mondrian broke with the group after van Doesburg proposed the theory of elementarism, suggesting that a diagonal line is more vital than horizontal and vertical ones. In addition, the De Stijl group acquired many new \"members\". [[Dada]]ist influences, such as [[I.&nbsp;K. Bonset]]'s poetry and [[Aldo Camini]]'s \"antiphilosophy\" generated controversy as well. Only after Van Doesburg's death was it revealed that Bonset and Camini were two of his pseudonyms.\n\n=== After van Doesburg's death ===\n[[File:Cornelis van Eesteren and Theo van Doesburg 2.jpg|thumb|[[Theo van Doesburg]] (r) and [[Cornelis van Eesteren]] (l) in their studio in [[Paris]], 1923]]\n[[File:Uitnodiging tentoonstelling de Stijl.jpg|thumb|Exhibition \"De Stijl\" in [[Paris]], 15 October \u2013 15 November 1923]]\n[[File:Ontwikkelingstentoonstelling Theo van Doesburg Weimar 1923.jpg|thumb|[[Theo van Doesburg]], activities in [[Weimar]] (outside the [[Bauhaus|Bauhaus Weimar]] 1919\u20131925). Private courses, introduction of the Cubist architecture of \"De Stijl\", 1921\u20131922. Retrospective in Landesmuseum Weimar, 16 December 1923 \u2013 23 January 1924]]\nTheo van Doesburg died in [[Davos]], Switzerland, in 1931. His wife, Nelly, administered his estate.\n\nBecause of van Doesburg's pivotal role within De Stijl, the group did not survive. Individual members remained in contact, but De Stijl could not exist without a strong central character. Thus, it may be wrong to think of De Stijl as a close-knit group of artists. The members knew each other, but most communication took place by letter. For example, Mondrian and Rietveld never met in person.\n\nMany, though not all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, continued designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued working in the style he had initiated around 1920. Van der Leck, on the other hand, went back to figurative compositions after his departure from the group.\n\n=== Influence on architecture ===\nThe De Stijl influence on architecture remained considerable long after its inception; [[Mies van der Rohe]] was among the most important proponents of its ideas. Between 1923 and 1924, [[Gerrit Rietveld|Rietveld]] designed the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, the only building to have been created completely according to De Stijl principles. Examples of Stijl-influenced works by [[J.J.P. Oud]] can be found in [[Rotterdam]] (''{{Ill|Caf\u00e9 De Unie|nl}}'') and [[Hoek van Holland]]. Other examples include the [[Eames House]] by Charles and Ray Eames, and the interior decoration for the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette dance hall]] in Strasbourg, designed by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp and van Doesburg.\n\n=== Present day ===\nWorks by De Stijl members are scattered all over the world, but De Stijl-themed exhibitions are organised regularly. Museums with large De Stijl collections include the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in [[The Hague]] (which owns the world's most extensive, although not exclusively De Stijl-related, Mondrian collection) and [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Stedelijk Museum]], where many works by Rietveld and Van Doesburg are on display. The [[{{Not a typo|Centraal}} Museum]] of [[Utrecht]] has the largest Rietveld collection worldwide; it also owns the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, Rietveld's adjacent \"show house\", and the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der Archives.\n\nThe movement inspired the design aesthetics of [[Rumyantsevo (Moscow Metro)|Rumyantsevo]] and [[Salaryevo]] stations of [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/marble-and-mondrian-a-tour-of-moscows-metro/g-19098971|title=Marble and Mondrian: a tour of Moscow metro|publisher=DW|accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artlebedev.com/metro/rumyantsevo/|title=Type design for Rumyantsevo Moscow Metro station|accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref>\n\n== Neoplasticists ==\n<!--need a ref for each artist included here-->\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Theo van Doesburg in military service.JPG|[[Theo van Doesburg]]\nFile:AntonyKok-1915.jpg|[[Antony Kok]]\nFile:Piet Mondrian 2.jpg|[[Piet Mondrian]]\nFile:J.J.P.

He writes, \"this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour\".

The \"plastic vision\" of De Stijl artists, also called Neo-Plasticism, saw itself as reaching beyond the changing appearance of natural things to bring an audience into intimate contact with an immutable core of reality, a reality that was not so much a visible fact as an underlying spiritual vision.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Denker|first1=Susan A.|title=De Stijl: 1917\u20131931, Visions of Utopia|journal=Art Journal|date=September 1982|volume=42|issue=3|pages=242\u2013246|doi=10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803}}</ref> In general, De Stijl proposed ultimate simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]], and the three primary values, [[black]], [[white]], and [[grey]]. The works avoided symmetry and attained aesthetic balance by the use of opposition. This element of the movement embodies the second meaning of ''stijl'': \"a post, jamb or support\"; this is best exemplified by the construction of crossing joints, most commonly seen in [[carpentry]].\n\nIn many of the group's three-dimensional works, vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. This feature can be found in the [[Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House]] and the [[Red and Blue Chair]].\n\nDe Stijl was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about \"ideal\" geometric forms (such as the \"perfect straight line\") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of mathematician [[M.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by [[Neopositivism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=978-0-13-062084-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/artpastartpresen0002wilk/page/523 523]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/artpastartpresen0002wilk/page/523}}</ref>  The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an \"-ism\" (e.g., [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]]), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like the Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.\n\nIn [[music]], De Stijl was an influence only on the work of composer [[Jakob van Domselaer]], a close friend of Mondrian. Between 1913 and 1916, he composed his ''Proeven van Stijlkunst'' (\"Experiments in Artistic Style\"), inspired mainly by Mondrian's paintings. This [[minimalist]]ic\u2014and, at the time, revolutionary\u2014music defined \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" musical elements and aimed at balancing those two principles. Van Domselaer was relatively unknown in his lifetime, and did not play a significant role within De Stijl.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nFrom the flurry of new art movements that followed the [[Impressionist]] revolutionary new perception of painting, [[Cubism]] arose in the early 20th century as an important and influential new direction. In the [[Netherlands]], too, there was interest in this \"new art\".\n\nHowever, because the Netherlands remained neutral in [[World War&nbsp;I]], Dutch artists were not able to leave the country after 1914 and were thus effectively isolated from the international art world\u2014and in particular, from [[Paris]], which was its centre then.\n\nDuring that period, Theo van Doesburg started looking for other artists to set up a [[Literary magazine|journal]] and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more successful writing about art than working as an independent artist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Theo van Doesburg|editor1-last=Translated by Janet Seligman|editor2-last=Introd. by Hans M.

He first met [[Piet Mondrian]] at an exhibition in [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Mondrian, who had moved to Paris in 1912 (and there, changed his name from \"Mondriaan\"), had been visiting the Netherlands when war broke out. He could not return to Paris, and was staying in the artists' community of [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], where he met [[Bart van der Leck]] and regularly saw [[M.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. In 1915, Schoenmaekers published ''Het nieuwe wereldbeeld'' (\"The New Image of the World\"), followed in 1916 by ''Beginselen der beeldende wiskunde'' (\"Principles of Plastic Mathematics\"). These two publications would greatly influence Mondrian and other members of De Stijl.\n\nVan Doesburg also knew [[J.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;P. Oud]] and the Hungarian artist [[Vilmos Husz\u00e1r]]. In 1917 the cooperation of these artists, together with the poet [[Anthony Kok]], resulted in the founding of De Stijl. The young architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]] joined the group in 1918.  At its height De Stijl had 100 members and the journal had a circulation of 300.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dujardin|first1=Alain|last2=Quirindongo|first2=Jop|title=This 100-Year-Old Dutch Movement Shaped Web Design Today|url=https://backchannel.com/100-years-of-clean-lines-how-de-stijl-is-influencing-digital-design-4397f1a72e37?curator=MediaREDEF#.kphtjs1er|journal=[[Backchannel (blog)]]|accessdate=29 January 2017|date=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nDuring those first few years, the group was still relatively homogeneous, although Van der Leck left in 1918 due to artistic differences of opinion. [[Manifesto]]s were being published, signed by all members. The social and economic circumstances of the time formed an important source of inspiration for their theories, and their ideas about architecture were heavily influenced by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].\n\nThe name ''Nieuwe Beelding'' was a term first coined in 1917 by Mondrian, who wrote a series of twelve articles called ''De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst'' (\"Neo-Plasticism in Painting\") that were published in the journal ''De Stijl''. In 1920 he published a book titled ''Le N\u00e9o-Plasticisme''.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/mondrian1920/0005 Piet Mondrian, ''Le N\u00e9o-Plasticisme, Principe G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Equivalence Plastique'', Paris, 1920], Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Heidelberg</ref>\n\n=== After 1920 ===\n[[File:Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior 1919.jpg|thumb|Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior, c.1919, [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Amsterdam]]]]\nAround 1921, the group's character started to change. From the time of van Doesburg's association with [[Bauhaus]], other influences started playing a role. These influences were mainly [[Malevich]] and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], to which not all members agreed. In 1924 Mondrian broke with the group after van Doesburg proposed the theory of elementarism, suggesting that a diagonal line is more vital than horizontal and vertical ones. In addition, the De Stijl group acquired many new \"members\". [[Dada]]ist influences, such as [[I.&nbsp;K. Bonset]]'s poetry and [[Aldo Camini]]'s \"antiphilosophy\" generated controversy as well. Only after Van Doesburg's death was it revealed that Bonset and Camini were two of his pseudonyms.\n\n=== After van Doesburg's death ===\n[[File:Cornelis van Eesteren and Theo van Doesburg 2.jpg|thumb|[[Theo van Doesburg]] (r) and [[Cornelis van Eesteren]] (l) in their studio in [[Paris]], 1923]]\n[[File:Uitnodiging tentoonstelling de Stijl.jpg|thumb|Exhibition \"De Stijl\" in [[Paris]], 15 October \u2013 15 November 1923]]\n[[File:Ontwikkelingstentoonstelling Theo van Doesburg Weimar 1923.jpg|thumb|[[Theo van Doesburg]], activities in [[Weimar]] (outside the [[Bauhaus|Bauhaus Weimar]] 1919\u20131925). Private courses, introduction of the Cubist architecture of \"De Stijl\", 1921\u20131922. Retrospective in Landesmuseum Weimar, 16 December 1923 \u2013 23 January 1924]]\nTheo van Doesburg died in [[Davos]], Switzerland, in 1931. His wife, Nelly, administered his estate.\n\nBecause of van Doesburg's pivotal role within De Stijl, the group did not survive. Individual members remained in contact, but De Stijl could not exist without a strong central character. Thus, it may be wrong to think of De Stijl as a close-knit group of artists. The members knew each other, but most communication took place by letter. For example, Mondrian and Rietveld never met in person.\n\nMany, though not all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, continued designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued working in the style he had initiated around 1920. Van der Leck, on the other hand, went back to figurative compositions after his departure from the group.\n\n=== Influence on architecture ===\nThe De Stijl influence on architecture remained considerable long after its inception; [[Mies van der Rohe]] was among the most important proponents of its ideas. Between 1923 and 1924, [[Gerrit Rietveld|Rietveld]] designed the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, the only building to have been created completely according to De Stijl principles. Examples of Stijl-influenced works by [[J.J.P. Oud]] can be found in [[Rotterdam]] (''{{Ill|Caf\u00e9 De Unie|nl}}'') and [[Hoek van Holland]]. Other examples include the [[Eames House]] by Charles and Ray Eames, and the interior decoration for the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette dance hall]] in Strasbourg, designed by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp and van Doesburg.\n\n=== Present day ===\nWorks by De Stijl members are scattered all over the world, but De Stijl-themed exhibitions are organised regularly. Museums with large De Stijl collections include the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in [[The Hague]] (which owns the world's most extensive, although not exclusively De Stijl-related, Mondrian collection) and [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Stedelijk Museum]], where many works by Rietveld and Van Doesburg are on display. The [[{{Not a typo|Centraal}} Museum]] of [[Utrecht]] has the largest Rietveld collection worldwide; it also owns the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, Rietveld's adjacent \"show house\", and the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der Archives.\n\nThe movement inspired the design aesthetics of [[Rumyantsevo (Moscow Metro)|Rumyantsevo]] and [[Salaryevo]] stations of [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/marble-and-mondrian-a-tour-of-moscows-metro/g-19098971|title=Marble and Mondrian: a tour of Moscow metro|publisher=DW|accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artlebedev.com/metro/rumyantsevo/|title=Type design for Rumyantsevo Moscow Metro station|accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref>\n\n== Neoplasticists ==\n<!--need a ref for each artist included here-->\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Theo van Doesburg in military service.JPG|[[Theo van Doesburg]]\nFile:AntonyKok-1915.jpg|[[Antony Kok]]\nFile:Piet Mondrian 2.jpg|[[Piet Mondrian]]\nFile:J.J.P.

Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to [[capillary permeability]].<!-- <ref name=Martina09/> --> As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the [[stromal cell]]s leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.<ref name=Martina09/>\n\n===Viral replication===\nOnce inside the skin, dengue virus binds to [[Langerhans cell]]s (a population of [[dendritic cell]]s in the skin that identifies pathogens).<ref name=Martina09/> The virus [[Receptor-mediated endocytosis|enters the cells]] through binding between viral proteins and [[membrane protein]]s on the Langerhans cell, specifically, the [[C-type lectin]]s called DC-SIGN, [[mannose receptor]] and [[CLEC5A]].<ref name=Life10/> DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry.<ref name=Guzman10/> The dendritic cell moves to the nearest [[lymph node]]. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]], the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ([[glycoprotein]]s). The now mature new viruses are released by [[exocytosis]]. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s.<ref name=Life10/>\n\nThe initial reaction of infected cells is to produce [[interferon]], a [[cytokine]] that raises many defenses against viral infection through the [[innate immune system]] by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK-STAT pathway]]. Some serotypes of the dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the [[adaptive immune system]], which leads to the generation of [[antibody|antibodies]] against the virus as well as [[T cell]]s that directly attack any cell infected with the virus.<ref name=Life10/> Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion by [[phagocyte|specialized cells]] and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but can replicate further.<ref name=Life10/>\n\n===Severe disease===\n[[File:antibody_dependent_enhancement.svg|thumb|In antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), antibodies bind to both viral particles and Fc gamma receptors expressed on immune cells, increasing the likelihood that the viruses will infect those cells.]]\nIt is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of [[antibody-dependent enhancement]] (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Life10/><ref name=Guzman10/> There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications,<ref name=White10/><ref name=Carod2013/> and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the [[complement system]].<ref name=Martina09/>\n\nSevere disease is marked by the problems of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within the blood to pass) and disordered [[coagulation|blood clotting]].<ref name=India10/><ref name=NEJM2012/><!--NEJM specifies upon the capillary/microvasculature--> These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial [[glycocalyx]], which acts as a [[Molecular sieve|molecular filter]] of blood components.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) are thought to be caused by an immune system response.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Other processes of interest include infected cells that become [[necrosis|necrotic]]\u2014which affect both coagulation and [[fibrinolysis]] (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)\u2014and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.<ref name=Martina09/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;

IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14\u201321 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus.<ref name=Gubler2010/><ref name=Chen/><ref name=Guzman10/> In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis.<ref name=NEJM2012/> The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.<ref name=Gubler2010/>\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:Vector Control.jpg|upright=1.35|alt=A black and white photograph of people

Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to [[capillary permeability]].<!-- <ref name=Martina09/> --> As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the [[stromal cell]]s leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.<ref name=Martina09/>\n\n===Viral replication===\nOnce inside the skin, dengue virus binds to [[Langerhans cell]]s (a population of [[dendritic cell]]s in the skin that identifies pathogens).<ref name=Martina09/> The virus [[Receptor-mediated endocytosis|enters the cells]] through binding between viral proteins and [[membrane protein]]s on the Langerhans cell, specifically, the [[C-type lectin]]s called DC-SIGN, [[mannose receptor]] and [[CLEC5A]].<ref name=Life10/> DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry.<ref name=Guzman10/> The dendritic cell moves to the nearest [[lymph node]]. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]], the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ([[glycoprotein]]s). The now mature new viruses are released by [[exocytosis]]. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s.<ref name=Life10/>\n\nThe initial reaction of infected cells is to produce [[interferon]], a [[cytokine]] that raises many defenses against viral infection through the [[innate immune system]] by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK-STAT pathway]]. Some serotypes of the dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the [[adaptive immune system]], which leads to the generation of [[antibody|antibodies]] against the virus as well as [[T cell]]s that directly attack any cell infected with the virus.<ref name=Life10/> Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion by [[phagocyte|specialized cells]] and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but can replicate further.<ref name=Life10/>\n\n===Severe disease===\n[[File:antibody_dependent_enhancement.svg|thumb|In antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), antibodies bind to both viral particles and Fc gamma receptors expressed on immune cells, increasing the likelihood that the viruses will infect those cells.]]\nIt is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of [[antibody-dependent enhancement]] (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Life10/><ref name=Guzman10/> There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications,<ref name=White10/><ref name=Carod2013/> and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the [[complement system]].<ref name=Martina09/>\n\nSevere disease is marked by the problems of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within the blood to pass) and disordered [[coagulation|blood clotting]].<ref name=India10/><ref name=NEJM2012/><!--NEJM specifies upon the capillary/microvasculature--> These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial [[glycocalyx]], which acts as a [[Molecular sieve|molecular filter]] of blood components.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) are thought to be caused by an immune system response.<ref name=NEJM2012/> Other processes of interest include infected cells that become [[necrosis|necrotic]]\u2014which affect both coagulation and [[fibrinolysis]] (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)\u2014and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.<ref name=Martina09/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;

Some have powerful jets for [[massage]] purposes. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as [[spa]]s or by the trade name [[Jacuzzi]].\n\nIn contrast to a typical [[bathtub]], a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for [[swimming pool sanitation]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).\n\n==History==\nThe earliest hot tubs were [[Caldera|calderas]] in which hot stones were placed to heat the water.{{cn|date=August 2019}} [[Therma, Icaria|Therma]] in [[Icaria|Ikaria]] has been a very popular place particularly for hydrotherapy ever since the 4th century BC.<ref name=\"greeka.com\">[http://www.greeka.com/eastern_aegean/ikaria/ikaria-excursions/ikaria-ancient-spa.htm Ikaria: The Ancient Spa of Therma in Ikaria Greece, Eastern Aegean], Greeka.com.</ref> The remains of wrecked marble bathtubs along with a pre-historic aqueduct that have been unearthed from this area bear ample testimony of the place's popularity in the ancient times.<ref name=\"greeka.com\"/>\n\nIn 737 A.D., Japan's first [[onsen]] opened near [[Izumo, Shimane]], and centuries later the first [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] (inns) were built, offering food, accommodations, and soaking tubs called [[ofuro]].\n\nIn ancient Rome there were three types of baths: baths at home (balnea), private baths (balnea privata), and public baths (balnea publica). The practice of bathing was so engrained that the Roman legions, during their long occupations in foreign lands, built their own baths at mineral and thermal springs in the newly conquered lands. Examples are found all over Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schadewalt H. The history of Roman bathing culture [in Dutch]. Integraal1989;4:25\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in 476 and the rise of Christianity, cleanliness was abandoned since the Church considered that the practice of bathing a prelude to forbidden behaviour.<ref>Jackson R.

Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by [[Jacuzzi]]. [[Fiberglass]] shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.\n\n==Water treatment==\n\n===Plumbing===\nThe plumbing of the hot tub consists of:\n* A pressure system delivering water to the jets\n* A suction system returning water to the pumps.\n* A [[Hot tub filter|filtration system]]: the plumbing has to incorporate a filter system to help clean the water. Some models use a separate small 24/7 filter pump while others use programmed settings of the main pumps.\n* Induced air: The jets may use a [[venturi effect]] to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.\n* Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different \"bubbly\" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air.\n* An [[ozone]] system: ozonation is a common adjunct to water maintenance, and if installed will have its own set of hoses and fittings.\n\n===Heating and energy use===\nHot tubs are usually heated using an [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as [[solar hot water]] systems. Hot tubs are also found at natural [[hot spring]]s; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature.\n\nEffective insulation greatly improves the energy efficiency of a hot tub. There are several different styles of hot tub insulation: some manufacturers fill the entire cabinet with foam, while others insulate the underside of the shell, the inside of the cabinet, or both. Many manufacturers advertise the superiority of their approach to insulation, but few independent side-by-side comparisons are available. The hot tub pump and hot tub heater represent most of the power consumption in a hot tub and vary in use of power depending on their size.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tips to Improve Hot Tub Energy Use|url=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0332/1441/files/10_Hot_Tub_Energy_Saving_Tips_1.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nEnergy efficiency of the tubs has been studied by the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGEC)]].<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2003rulemaking/documents/case_studies/CASE_Portable_Spa.pdf\n |title=Analysis of Standards Options For Portable Electric Spas\n|date=May 12, 2004\n|author=Pacific Gas and Electric Company\n|publisher=California Energy Commission\n|accessdate=2008-09-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006153904/http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2003rulemaking/documents/case_studies/CASE_Portable_Spa.pdf |archivedate = 2006-10-06}} (archived from [http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2003rulemaking/documents/case_studies/CASE_Portable_Spa.pdf the original] on 2006-10-06).</ref>  The industry has responded to the study.<ref>Katherine Wang and Joshua Keim (September 2007).

Some covers are better for insulation and therefore are lighter on internal parts and energy efficiency. Some examples of covers are insulated, aluminum, rolling, or a tonneau.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Sanitation and water quality===\n{{Main article|Swimming pool sanitation}}\nSince some hot tubs are not drained after each use it is necessary to treat the water to keep it attractive and safe. It must be neither too alkaline nor too acidic, and must be sanitised to stay free of harmful microorganisms. Partly due to their high water temperatures, hot tubs can pose particular health risks if not regularly maintained: [[List of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks|outbreaks]] of [[Legionnaires' Disease]] have been traced to poorly sanitized hot tubs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke-on-Trent Legionnaires' deaths: Report calls for hot tub review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-21755913|author=BBC|date=12 March 2013|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref> Typically [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]] are used as sanitizers, but [[salt water chlorination]] is starting to become more common. Hot tubs should also be periodically shocked, which means oxidizing or breaking down organic material left behind from the sanitizer, as well as non-filterable material such as soap films and perspiration.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nSanitation can also be aided by a non-chemical [[Ozonator#Consumers|ozonator]].\n\nFor aesthetic reasons, and for the sanitizer to work properly, water should be neither too [[alkaline]] nor too acidic (low [[pH]]). The hardness level of the water, measured as the amount of dissolved calcium, is also important. Insufficient hardness can lead to corrosion and water foaming.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n==Types==\n[[File:Paljuilua 1.jpg|thumb|Wooden hot tub on a trailer, [[Finland]].]]\n* Portable vinyl-liner hot tub: these are cheaper and smaller, and require less power, e.g. 110\u2013120 V 15 A household power circuits in North America.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* [[rotational molding|Roto-molded]] hot tubs are constructed with the shell and surrounding cabinet as a single piece. They have molded seating.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Acrylic: these hot tubs have a cast acrylic shell, supported by a frame structure, and are usually surrounded by a skirt of either cedar or simulated wood-grain plastic. They typically can seat two to seven persons or more.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Cement: hot tubs can also be built of cement, above-ground, or in-ground like a small swimming pool.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Wooden hot tubs: round wooden hot tubs peaked in popularity in the 1970s, having now been replaced by modern construction methods. Wooden hot tubs are often made of redwood or cedar and assembled from vertical staves and the structure is held together like wooden barrels, with metal bands.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Stainless steel hot tubs can be made in any shape and size and are extremely durable.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Glasfiber hot tub: glass reinforced polyester (GRP) hot tubs have made of a plastic matrix reinforced by fine fibers of glass.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Inflatable PVC hot tubs\n\n==Safety==\nSitting in water above normal body temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness and subsequently result in drowning. The [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) recommends that water temperatures never exceed 40 degrees Celsius. A temperature of 37 degrees is considered safe for a healthy adult. Soaking in water above 39 degrees Celsius can cause fetal damage during the first three months of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|title=CPSC Warns Of Hot Tub Temperatures|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtml79/79071.html|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|accessdate=2 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011180133/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml79/79071.html|archivedate=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt is also recommended to install [[residual-current device]]s for protection against electrocution.

Some have powerful jets for [[massage]] purposes. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as [[spa]]s or by the trade name [[Jacuzzi]].\n\nIn contrast to a typical [[bathtub]], a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for [[swimming pool sanitation]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).\n\n==History==\nThe earliest hot tubs were [[Caldera|calderas]] in which hot stones were placed to heat the water.{{cn|date=August 2019}} [[Therma, Icaria|Therma]] in [[Icaria|Ikaria]] has been a very popular place particularly for hydrotherapy ever since the 4th century BC.<ref name=\"greeka.com\">[http://www.greeka.com/eastern_aegean/ikaria/ikaria-excursions/ikaria-ancient-spa.htm Ikaria: The Ancient Spa of Therma in Ikaria Greece, Eastern Aegean], Greeka.com.</ref> The remains of wrecked marble bathtubs along with a pre-historic aqueduct that have been unearthed from this area bear ample testimony of the place's popularity in the ancient times.<ref name=\"greeka.com\"/>\n\nIn 737 A.D., Japan's first [[onsen]] opened near [[Izumo, Shimane]], and centuries later the first [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] (inns) were built, offering food, accommodations, and soaking tubs called [[ofuro]].\n\nIn ancient Rome there were three types of baths: baths at home (balnea), private baths (balnea privata), and public baths (balnea publica). The practice of bathing was so engrained that the Roman legions, during their long occupations in foreign lands, built their own baths at mineral and thermal springs in the newly conquered lands. Examples are found all over Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schadewalt H. The history of Roman bathing culture [in Dutch]. Integraal1989;4:25\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in 476 and the rise of Christianity, cleanliness was abandoned since the Church considered that the practice of bathing a prelude to forbidden behaviour.<ref>Jackson R.

Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by [[Jacuzzi]]. [[Fiberglass]] shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.\n\n==Water treatment==\n\n===Plumbing===\nThe plumbing of the hot tub consists of:\n* A pressure system delivering water to the jets\n* A suction system returning water to the pumps.\n* A [[Hot tub filter|filtration system]]: the plumbing has to incorporate a filter system to help clean the water. Some models use a separate small 24/7 filter pump while others use programmed settings of the main pumps.\n* Induced air: The jets may use a [[venturi effect]] to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.\n* Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different \"bubbly\" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air.\n* An [[ozone]] system: ozonation is a common adjunct to water maintenance, and if installed will have its own set of hoses and fittings.\n\n===Heating and energy use===\nHot tubs are usually heated using an [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as [[solar hot water]] systems. Hot tubs are also found at natural [[hot spring]]s; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature.\n\nEffective insulation greatly improves the energy efficiency of a hot tub. There are several different styles of hot tub insulation: some manufacturers fill the entire cabinet with foam, while others insulate the underside of the shell, the inside of the cabinet, or both. Many manufacturers advertise the superiority of their approach to insulation, but few independent side-by-side comparisons are available. The hot tub pump and hot tub heater represent most of the power consumption in a hot tub and vary in use of power depending on their size.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tips to Improve Hot Tub Energy Use|url=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0332/1441/files/10_Hot_Tub_Energy_Saving_Tips_1.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nEnergy efficiency of the tubs has been studied by the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGEC)]].<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2003rulemaking/documents/case_studies/CASE_Portable_Spa.pdf\n |title=Analysis of Standards Options For Portable Electric Spas\n|date=May 12, 2004\n|author=Pacific Gas and Electric Company\n|publisher=California Energy Commission\n|accessdate=2008-09-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006153904/http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2003rulemaking/documents/case_studies/CASE_Portable_Spa.pdf |archivedate = 2006-10-06}} (archived from [http://www.energy.ca.gov/appliances/2003rulemaking/documents/case_studies/CASE_Portable_Spa.pdf the original] on 2006-10-06).</ref>  The industry has responded to the study.<ref>Katherine Wang and Joshua Keim (September 2007).

Some covers are better for insulation and therefore are lighter on internal parts and energy efficiency. Some examples of covers are insulated, aluminum, rolling, or a tonneau.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Sanitation and water quality===\n{{Main article|Swimming pool sanitation}}\nSince some hot tubs are not drained after each use it is necessary to treat the water to keep it attractive and safe. It must be neither too alkaline nor too acidic, and must be sanitised to stay free of harmful microorganisms. Partly due to their high water temperatures, hot tubs can pose particular health risks if not regularly maintained: [[List of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks|outbreaks]] of [[Legionnaires' Disease]] have been traced to poorly sanitized hot tubs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke-on-Trent Legionnaires' deaths: Report calls for hot tub review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-21755913|author=BBC|date=12 March 2013|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref> Typically [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]] are used as sanitizers, but [[salt water chlorination]] is starting to become more common. Hot tubs should also be periodically shocked, which means oxidizing or breaking down organic material left behind from the sanitizer, as well as non-filterable material such as soap films and perspiration.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nSanitation can also be aided by a non-chemical [[Ozonator#Consumers|ozonator]].\n\nFor aesthetic reasons, and for the sanitizer to work properly, water should be neither too [[alkaline]] nor too acidic (low [[pH]]). The hardness level of the water, measured as the amount of dissolved calcium, is also important. Insufficient hardness can lead to corrosion and water foaming.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n==Types==\n[[File:Paljuilua 1.jpg|thumb|Wooden hot tub on a trailer, [[Finland]].]]\n* Portable vinyl-liner hot tub: these are cheaper and smaller, and require less power, e.g. 110\u2013120 V 15 A household power circuits in North America.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* [[rotational molding|Roto-molded]] hot tubs are constructed with the shell and surrounding cabinet as a single piece. They have molded seating.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Acrylic: these hot tubs have a cast acrylic shell, supported by a frame structure, and are usually surrounded by a skirt of either cedar or simulated wood-grain plastic. They typically can seat two to seven persons or more.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Cement: hot tubs can also be built of cement, above-ground, or in-ground like a small swimming pool.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Wooden hot tubs: round wooden hot tubs peaked in popularity in the 1970s, having now been replaced by modern construction methods. Wooden hot tubs are often made of redwood or cedar and assembled from vertical staves and the structure is held together like wooden barrels, with metal bands.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Stainless steel hot tubs can be made in any shape and size and are extremely durable.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Glasfiber hot tub: glass reinforced polyester (GRP) hot tubs have made of a plastic matrix reinforced by fine fibers of glass.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n* Inflatable PVC hot tubs\n\n==Safety==\nSitting in water above normal body temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness and subsequently result in drowning. The [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) recommends that water temperatures never exceed 40 degrees Celsius. A temperature of 37 degrees is considered safe for a healthy adult. Soaking in water above 39 degrees Celsius can cause fetal damage during the first three months of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|title=CPSC Warns Of Hot Tub Temperatures|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtml79/79071.html|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|accessdate=2 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011180133/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml79/79071.html|archivedate=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt is also recommended to install [[residual-current device]]s for protection against electrocution.

They also can build nap nests to rest in the afternoon, these are usually more poorly constructed than the night nests and can be built both on the ground and on the trees. At some research sites such as Bili forest, in Congo, chimpanzees can build a significant proportion of their night nests on the ground. Nests consist of a mattress, supported on a strong foundation, and lined above with soft leaves and twigs. Nests are built in trees which have a minimum diameter of {{convert|5|cm|ft}} and may be located at a height of {{convert|1|to|45|m|ft}}. Day and night nests are built.

Young orangutans learn by observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. Nest-building is a leading reason for young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. Starting at 6 months of age, orangutans practice nest building and gain proficiency by the time they are 3 years old.<ref name=\"WichAtmoko2009\"/> Initially, a suitable tree is located: Orangutans are selective about sites even though many tree species are utilised. The foundation is then built by pulling together branches under them and joining them at a point. After the foundation has been built, they bend smaller, leafy branches onto the foundation; this serves the purpose of and is termed as the \"mattress\". After this, orangutans braid the tips of branches into the mattress. This increases the stability of the nest and forms the final process of nest building. Orangutans may add additional features such as \"pillows\", \"blankets\", \"roofs\" and \"bunk-beds\" to their nest.<ref name=\"WichAtmoko2009\"/> Orangutans make \"pillows\" by clumping together leafy branches with the leaves in the center and the twig shoots pointed outward. They bite the twigs to blunt sharp ends. Pillows are added to night nests but are usually absent from day nests. A \"blanket\" consists of large leafy branches with which orangutans cover themselves after lying down. Orangutans may create a waterproof overhead shelter for the nest by braiding together a loose selection of branches. They may also make a \"bunk-nest\" or \"bunk-bed\", a few metres above the main nest.<ref name=\"WichAtmoko2009\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\nA study on the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of primate behaviour has revealed that the use of tree holes or nests are important in the life-history strategies of many strepsirrhine species and some [[New World monkey]] species.<ref name=\"Kappeler1998\">{{cite journal |last1=Kappeler |first1=Peter M. |year=1998 |title=Nests, Tree Holes, and the Evolution of Primate Life Histories |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume= 46|issue=1 |pages=7\u201333 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)46:1<7::AID-AJP3>3.0.CO;2-# |pmid=9730211}}</ref>\n\nAlternative strategies of infant care which involve carrying the infants rather than leaving them, have evolved several times but have reproductive costs and generally slower rates of population increase than species which build nests.<ref name=\"Ross2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Ross |year=1991 |title=Park or ride?

They also can build nap nests to rest in the afternoon, these are usually more poorly constructed than the night nests and can be built both on the ground and on the trees. At some research sites such as Bili forest, in Congo, chimpanzees can build a significant proportion of their night nests on the ground. Nests consist of a mattress, supported on a strong foundation, and lined above with soft leaves and twigs. Nests are built in trees which have a minimum diameter of {{convert|5|cm|ft}} and may be located at a height of {{convert|1|to|45|m|ft}}. Day and night nests are built. Nests may be located in groups.<ref name=\"WranghamSciences1996\">{{cite book|last=Wrangham|first=Richard W.|title=Chimpanzee cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzBIHPeE45IC&pg=PA115|accessdate=2 July 2011|year=1996|publisher=Chicago Academy of Sciences, Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-11663-4|pages=115\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n===In orangutans===\n[[File:Orangutan Nest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Orangutan]] nest.]]\n[[Orangutan]]s build day and night nests. Young orangutans learn by observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. Nest-building is a leading reason for young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. Starting at 6 months of age, orangutans practice nest building and gain proficiency by the time they are 3 years old.<ref name=\"WichAtmoko2009\"/> Initially, a suitable tree is located: Orangutans are selective about sites even though many tree species are utilised. The foundation is then built by pulling together branches under them and joining them at a point. After the foundation has been built, they bend smaller, leafy branches onto the foundation; this serves the purpose of and is termed as the \"mattress\". After this, orangutans braid the tips of branches into the mattress. This increases the stability of the nest and forms the final process of nest building. Orangutans may add additional features such as \"pillows\", \"blankets\", \"roofs\" and \"bunk-beds\" to their nest.<ref name=\"WichAtmoko2009\"/> Orangutans make \"pillows\" by clumping together leafy branches with the leaves in the center and the twig shoots pointed outward. They bite the twigs to blunt sharp ends. Pillows are added to night nests but are usually absent from day nests. A \"blanket\" consists of large leafy branches with which orangutans cover themselves after lying down. Orangutans may create a waterproof overhead shelter for the nest by braiding together a loose selection of branches. They may also make a \"bunk-nest\" or \"bunk-bed\", a few metres above the main nest.<ref name=\"WichAtmoko2009\"/>\n\n==Evolution==\nA study on the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of primate behaviour has revealed that the use of tree holes or nests are important in the life-history strategies of many strepsirrhine species and some [[New World monkey]] species.<ref name=\"Kappeler1998\">{{cite journal |last1=Kappeler |first1=Peter M. |year=1998 |title=Nests, Tree Holes, and the Evolution of Primate Life Histories |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume= 46|issue=1 |pages=7\u201333 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1998)46:1<7::AID-AJP3>3.0.CO;2-# |pmid=9730211}}</ref>\n\nAlternative strategies of infant care which involve carrying the infants rather than leaving them, have evolved several times but have reproductive costs and generally slower rates of population increase than species which build nests.<ref name=\"Ross2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Ross |year=1991 |title=Park or ride?

Galagoes give birth to single young which is left in a nest as an infant and carried to a parking place in the vegetation orally by the mothers. In addition, the use of nests or tree holes as shelters for young infants differs functionally from the use of resting places by adult animals (which may be accompanied by infants).<ref name=\"Kappeler1998\"/>{{clarify|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ecosystem engineer]]\n* [[Template:Life timeline|Life timeline]]\n* [[Template:Nature timeline|Nature timeline]]\n* [[Niche construction]]\n* [[Structures built by animals]]\n* [[Tool use by animals]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] [http://www.nationalgeographicstock.com/ngsimages/explore/explorecomp.jsf?xsys=SE&id=440061 image of Aye-aye on nest]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} with caption \"An aye-aye wakes in its arboreal sleeping nest to begin foraging.\"\n\n{{Ethology}}\n{{portal bar|Evolutionary biology}}\n\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Shelters built or used by animals]]\n[[Category:Primate behavior]]\n", "name_user": "AshLin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cp eds image", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest-building_in_primates"}
