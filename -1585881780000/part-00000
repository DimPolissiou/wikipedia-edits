It participates in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]; the conference's [[American football|football]] programs compete in the [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS; formerly known as Division I-AA), the lower of two levels of Division I football competition. The OVC has 12 members, 9 of which compete in football in the conference.\n\n==History==\n''Primary source :''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcsports.com/sports/2012/6/13/GEN_0613124325.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/sports/2012/6/13/GEN_0613124325.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=OVC History |publisher=OVCSports.com |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref><br />\nThe Ohio Valley Conference can trace its roots to 1941 when [[Murray State Racers|Murray State]] athletic director Roy Stewart, [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels|Eastern Kentucky]] athletic director Charles \"Turkey\" Hughes, and [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers|Western Kentucky]] public relations director Kelly Thompson first formulated the idea of establishing a regional athletics conference. The plan was put on hold due to World War II, but it was resurrected after the conclusion of the war.  In 1948, the three schools joined with [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]], [[Morehead State]], and [[Evansville Purple Aces|Evansville]] to form the Ohio Valley Conference.  While many collegiate conferences are struggling today with the question of whether their policies and rules should be determined by the athletic departments or by the institutional heads, from the very beginning, the OVC has been run by the presidents of its member schools.\n\nHistorically, the OVC was a pioneer in racial desegregation, with Morehead State signing the conference's first black athlete, Marshall Banks, in 1958. The rest of the OVC soon followed in Morehead State's wake. From 1986 to 2018, the OVC was unique among NCAA Division I conferences in that it included one [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black university]], [[Tennessee State University]], in a conference that otherwise consists of institutions that are not traditionally black. During this period, every other HBCU in NCAA Division I belonged to either the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]] or [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]]. That distinction changed in July 2018 when [[Hampton University]] joined the [[Big South Conference]].\n\nThe OVC has also been a leader in advancement of sports opportunities for women. The conference began adding championship competitions for women in 1977 several years after the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] began sponsoring national championships for women, but seven years before the NCAA was ready to move into the field.  Since 2009, the OVC has been led by Commissioner Beth DeBauche, one of only six female commissioners for the thirty-two Division I conferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ovcsports.sidearmsports.com/staff.aspx?staff=1 |title=OVCSports.com \u2013 Staff Directory |publisher=Ovcsports.sidearmsports.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref>\n\nAthletic rivalries, really close colleges and especially when competitors are in relatively close proximity, can generate problems with fan behavior, and the conference leadership struggled with controlling the issue for many years.  When the national debate on the problem reached its apex in the mid-1990s, the OVC unveiled the national first of its kind \"Sportsmanship Statement\" in 1995, stating the conference's policy on, \"... principles of fair play, ethical conduct and respect for one's opponent.\"  Since then, the OVC has also introduced individual, team (for each sport), and institutional sportsmanship awards.\n\nFounded by six schools, the expansions of 2007 and 2011 have brought the Ohio Valley Conference membership to twelve schools, the most in its history.\n\n==OVC Digital Network==\nIn August 2012, the OVC announced that it had launched the OVC Digital Network as a replacement for and improvement over the conference's former efforts to provide [[streaming video]] coverage of many athletic events that had been in place since 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2012/8/20/BB_0820122244.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2012/8/20/BB_0820122244.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=Ohio Valley Conference Launches OVC Digital Network |publisher=OVCSports.com |date=2012-08-22 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref> This website carries live, student-produced coverage of most conference games and some non-conference games in baseball, men's and women's basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball as well as some coaches' shows, special presentations, and archived game-casts available for later viewing.\n\nIn its first two years, the network provided well over 600,000 viewings of streamed live video of more than 1400 events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2014/7/29/GEN_0729142851.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2014/7/29/GEN_0729142851.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=OVC Digital Network Ready For Year Three |publisher=OVCSports.com |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the OVC Digital Network used to be used to televise all our conference games, we have switched over to ESPN+.

After four seasons as an Independent, the team joined the Pioneer Football League in 2001, and remained there through the 2005 season. Austin Peay then returned to scholarship football, spending the 2006 season as an Independent before re-entering OVC football competition in 2007.\n\n==Conference divisions==\nStarting with the 2012\u201313 school year, the twelve member schools divided into two divisions for those sports in which all schools compete. In the 2014\u201315 season, women's sports with twelve teams returned to a single league table, while continuing to play a divisional schedule. Men's basketball moved to an 18-game schedule in 2017-18, and they continue to play home-and-home versus the former divisional rivals, and they play home-and-home versus two teams from the other division, with those opponents on a rotation that sets up different pairs from year-to-year.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* East Division\n** Belmont\n** Eastern Kentucky\n** Jacksonville State\n** Morehead State\n** Tennessee State\n** Tennessee Tech\n{{col-break}}\n* West Division\n** Austin Peay\n** Eastern Illinois\n** Murray State\n** Southeast Missouri\n** SIU Edwardsville\n** UT Martin\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Sports offered==\nThe Ohio Valley Conference currently offers championship competition in 19 NCAA sanctioned sports, with eight for men, 10 for women, and rifle for men's, women's, and coed teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcsports.com/ |title=Official Web Site of the Ohio Valley Conference |publisher=OVCSports.com |accessdate=2015-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/ |archivedate=October 2, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\n|+ '''Teams in OVC competition'''\n!Sport||Men's||Women's||Coed\n|-\n|[[College baseball|Baseball]]||<center>11</center>||<center>-</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n|[[College basketball|Basketball]]||<center>12</center>||<center>12</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n| [[Beach volleyball|Beach Volleyball]] || <center>\u2013</center> || <center>6</center> || <center>\u2013</center>\n|-\n|[[Cross country running|Cross Country]]||<center>12</center>||<center>12</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n|[[College football|Football]]||<center>9</center>||<center>-</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n|[[Golf]]||<center>11</center>||<center>10</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n|[[NCAA Rifle Championship|Rifle]]||<center>0</center> ||<center>1</center>||<center>4</center>\n|-\n||[[College soccer|Soccer]]||<center>-</center>||<center>11</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n|[[College softball|Softball]]||<center>-</center>||<center>12</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n||[[College tennis|Tennis]]||<center>6</center>||<center>9</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n||[[Track and field#Indoor|Track and Field (Indoor)]]||<center>6</center>||<center>11</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n||[[Track and field#Outdoor|Track and Field (Outdoor)]]||<center>7</center>||<center>11</center>||<center>-</center>\n|-\n| [[Volleyball|Volleyball (Indoor)]] || <center>\u2013</center> || <center>12</center> || <center>-</center>\n|}\n\n===Men's sponsored sports by school===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

It participates in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]; the conference's [[American football|football]] programs compete in the [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS; formerly known as Division I-AA), the lower of two levels of Division I football competition. The OVC has 12 members, 9 of which compete in football in the conference.\n\n==History==\n''Primary source :''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcsports.com/sports/2012/6/13/GEN_0613124325.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/sports/2012/6/13/GEN_0613124325.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=OVC History |publisher=OVCSports.com |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref><br />\nThe Ohio Valley Conference can trace its roots to 1941 when [[Murray State Racers|Murray State]] athletic director Roy Stewart, [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels|Eastern Kentucky]] athletic director Charles \"Turkey\" Hughes, and [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers|Western Kentucky]] public relations director Kelly Thompson first formulated the idea of establishing a regional athletics conference. The plan was put on hold due to World War II, but it was resurrected after the conclusion of the war.  In 1948, the three schools joined with [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]], [[Morehead State]], and [[Evansville Purple Aces|Evansville]] to form the Ohio Valley Conference.  While many collegiate conferences are struggling today with the question of whether their policies and rules should be determined by the athletic departments or by the institutional heads, from the very beginning, the OVC has been run by the presidents of its member schools.\n\nHistorically, the OVC was a pioneer in racial desegregation, with Morehead State signing the conference's first black athlete, Marshall Banks, in 1958. The rest of the OVC soon followed in Morehead State's wake. From 1986 to 2018, the OVC was unique among NCAA Division I conferences in that it included one [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black university]], [[Tennessee State University]], in a conference that otherwise consists of institutions that are not traditionally black. During this period, every other HBCU in NCAA Division I belonged to either the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]] or [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]]. That distinction changed in July 2018 when [[Hampton University]] joined the [[Big South Conference]].\n\nThe OVC has also been a leader in advancement of sports opportunities for women. The conference began adding championship competitions for women in 1977 several years after the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] began sponsoring national championships for women, but seven years before the NCAA was ready to move into the field.  Since 2009, the OVC has been led by Commissioner Beth DeBauche, one of only six female commissioners for the thirty-two Division I conferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ovcsports.sidearmsports.com/staff.aspx?staff=1 |title=OVCSports.com \u2013 Staff Directory |publisher=Ovcsports.sidearmsports.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref>\n\nAthletic rivalries, really close colleges and especially when competitors are in relatively close proximity, can generate problems with fan behavior, and the conference leadership struggled with controlling the issue for many years.  When the national debate on the problem reached its apex in the mid-1990s, the OVC unveiled the national first of its kind \"Sportsmanship Statement\" in 1995, stating the conference's policy on, \"... principles of fair play, ethical conduct and respect for one's opponent.\"  Since then, the OVC has also introduced individual, team (for each sport), and institutional sportsmanship awards.\n\nFounded by six schools, the expansions of 2007 and 2011 have brought the Ohio Valley Conference membership to twelve schools, the most in its history.\n\n==OVC Digital Network==\nIn August 2012, the OVC announced that it had launched the OVC Digital Network as a replacement for and improvement over the conference's former efforts to provide [[streaming video]] coverage of many athletic events that had been in place since 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2012/8/20/BB_0820122244.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2012/8/20/BB_0820122244.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=Ohio Valley Conference Launches OVC Digital Network |publisher=OVCSports.com |date=2012-08-22 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref> This website carries live, student-produced coverage of most conference games and some non-conference games in baseball, men's and women's basketball, football, soccer, softball, and volleyball as well as some coaches' shows, special presentations, and archived game-casts available for later viewing.\n\nIn its first two years, the network provided well over 600,000 viewings of streamed live video of more than 1400 events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2014/7/29/GEN_0729142851.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002001509/http://www.ovcsports.com/news/2014/7/29/GEN_0729142851.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-02 |title=OVC Digital Network Ready For Year Three |publisher=OVCSports.com |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the OVC Digital Network used to be used to televise all our conference games, we have switched over to ESPN+.\n\n==Member schools==\n\n===Full members===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Institution !!

In the moments we were calm enough to look around, we had to confront the magnitude of what had happened in Liberia. Two hundred and fifty thousand people were dead, a quarter of them children. One in three were displaced, with 350,000 living in internally displaced persons camps and the rest anywhere they could find shelter. One million people, mostly women and children, were at risk of malnutrition, diarrhea, measles and cholera because of contamination in the wells. More than 75 percent of the country's physical infrastructure, our roads, hospitals and schools, had been destroyed.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|167}}</blockquote>\n\nGbowee expressed particular concern for the \"psychic damage\" borne by Liberians:\n\n<blockquote>A whole generation of young men had no idea who they were without a gun in their hands. Several generations of women were widowed, had been raped, seen their daughters and mothers raped, and their children kill and be killed. Neighbors had turned against neighbors; young people had lost hope, and old people, everything they had painstakingly earned. To a person, we were traumatized.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|168}}</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview for the [[International Women's Day]], Gbowee also expressed:\n\n<blockquote>The Liberian women peace movement demonstrated to the world that grassroots movements are essential to sustaining peace; that women in leadership positions are effective brokers for peace; and the importance of culturally relevant [[social justice]] movements. Liberia's experience is a good example to the world that women\u2014especially African women\u2014can be drivers of peace<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/international-women%C2%B4s-day-interview-leymah-gbowee/|title=International Women\u00b4s Day: Interview With Leymah Gbowee|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2016|date=2014-03-08}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmid the destruction and unending needs, Gbowee was appalled by the arrogance, ignorance and overall cultural insensitivity of the United Nations agencies dispatched to help disarm the country, keep the peace, establish procedures for democratic governance, and initiate rebuilding efforts. \"People who have lived through a terrible conflict may be hungry and desperate, ''but they're not stupid'' (Gbowee's emphasis). They often have very good ideas about how peace can evolve, and they need to be asked.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|171}} Gbowee advocated for involving Liberian civil society, especially women's organizations, in restoring the country. She grew frustrated with the way the \"UN was spending many millions of dollars in Liberia, but most of it was on [their own] staffing resources.... If they had just given some of that money to the local people, it would have made a real difference.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|173}}\n\nBy the late fall and winter of 2003-04, \"the world of conflict resolution, peace-building and the global women's movement\" was calling Gbowee to write papers, come to conferences and otherwise explain the experience and views of WIPNET. Thelma Ekiyor encouraged Gbowee to overcome her lack of self-esteem among \"highly intelligent people who held master's degrees and represented powerful institutions\" by reading and studying further to understand the theories circulating in the world of peacebuilding.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|177}} She read ''The Peace Book'' by Louise Diamond, known for advocating [[multi-track diplomacy]], and ''The Journey Toward Reconciliation'' and ''The Little Book of Conflict Transformation'', both written by [[John Paul Lederach]], the founding director of the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at [[Eastern Mennonite University]].<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|177}} She went to a USAID conference in New York, her first trip out of Africa,<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|174-175}} to a conference in South Africa, and to Switzerland where she dealt with the Nigerian in charge of UN programs in Liberia.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|174-176}}\n\n===Masters degree in peacebuilding===\nIn the late spring of 2004, about eight months after the Ghana-Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, Gbowee made a decision to take college-level courses in the field in which she had been working: \"I'd heard about [[Eastern Mennonite University]] (EMU), an American college with a well-known program in peace-building and conflict resolution. It was a Christian school that emphasized community and service; it had a long-standing relationship with WANEP and a history of recruiting Africans to study there.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}} Her first stint at EMU \u2013 four weeks at its annual Summer Peacebuilding Institute \u2013 were \"a transformative time for me.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}}\n\nGbowee studied with Hizkias Assefa, whose writings she had read five years earlier when she first began working for St. Peter's Lutheran Church on trauma healing. She also studied with [[Howard Zehr]], \"who taught me the concept of restorative justice,\" whereby healing occurred through the joint efforts of victims and offenders to repair the harms done.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}}  She thought restorative justice was particularly applicable to Africa: \"Restorative justice was...something we could see as ours and not artificially imposed by Westerners. And we needed it, needed that return to tradition. A culture of impunity flourished throughout Africa. People, officials, governments did evil but were never held accountable. More than we needed to punish them, we needed to undo the damage they had done.... When I left EMU, I knew there was more here for me. Somehow I would find a way to come back.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178-179}}\n\nShe returned for a round-table called Strategies for Trauma Healing and Resilience in the summer of 2005 and then enrolled as a residential, full-time master's degree student in \"conflict transformation and peacebuilding\" at EMU's [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] in 2006-07:<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n<blockquote>At graduate school, I could feel my mind expand, my comprehension deepen. I realized I now could put a formal name, \"strategic peacebuilding,\" to what I'd done instinctively in Liberia.... Many of the other students at EMU had lived through conflict, and there was relief in being among them.... In Harrisonburg, a small old city in the Shenandoah Valley, far from Liberia and its sorrows and people who expected something from me, I didn't have to be strong. Every now and then \u2013 for instance, when I saw a mother with her children \u2013 I would burst into tears. No one at EMU thought that was strange. I met an old man who'd lost his entire family in the Rwandan genocide.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|179}}</blockquote>\n\nIn September 2006, just as Gbowee was embarking on her first full semester of graduate school, she went to New York City to address the UN on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the passage of Resolution 1325, which dealt with protecting women from gender-based violence and involving them in UN-linked peace efforts.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|179}} While in New York, she received a call from [[Abigail Disney]], a descendant of the founders of the Walt Disney Company, a feminist, and a philanthropist. Disney and a collaborator, Gini Reticker, wanted to talk with Gbowee about their desire to make a documentary about how the women of Liberia rallied themselves to force the men to stop battling.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Women in Peace and Security Network (WIPSEN)===\nDuring 2006-07 Gbowee also began talking with Ekiyor and Ecoma Alaga (a Nigerian, like Ekiyor) about splitting WIPNET from WANEP, believing the parent organization to be controlled financially by men and wanting the three of them to be fully in charge.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|187}} The founding director of WANEP, Gbowee's old friend Sam Gbaydee Doe, was sympathetic to the three women's desire for structural independence, but he had left WANEP to pursue a PhD in England.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|189}} WANEP was now led by another graduate of the MA in conflict transformation program at EMU, [[Emmanuel Bombande]] of Ghana,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emu.edu/now/peacebuilder/cjp-alumni/emmanuel-bombande/.|title=\u00bb Emmanuel Bombande|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref> who did not agree that the three women owned the WIPNET branch of WANEP and thus would not let it spin off.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|188-189}} As a result, Gbowee and her two colleagues started a new organization, [[Women in Peace and Security Network]] (WIPSEN), also based in Accra, Ghana.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|189}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wipsen-africa.org/wipsen/who/founders/ |title=Founders |website=[[WIPSEN-Africa.org]] |access-date=2020-01-19 }}</ref> Abigail Disney stepped up to help Gbowee raise funds for launching WIPSEN among philanthropists in New York, enabling her to secure $50,000 in seed money.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|202}}\n\n===Personal struggles===\nBy the time Gbowee finished her coursework at EMU on April 30, 2007, and returned to her children in Liberia in May 2007 \u2013 where her parents had been caring for them \u2013 she realized that her nine months away \"nearly broke all of us.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|194}} In Virginia, she had lived with \"a cold that never went away\" and she \"felt panic, sadness, and cold, swirling blackness\" as she faced \"being sued by former friends at WANEP over our desire to move in a new direction.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|200-201}} Her impending graduate degree (conferred at the end of 2007), growing fame, and other changes in her life strained the relationship she had with a Liberian man named Tunde, an employee of international agencies who had functioned as a father figure for her children for a decade, from the early period of the Liberian women's peace movement through Gbowee's graduate studies at EMU<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|203-204}} (for which he had paid the tuition<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|198}}). They broke up and by early 2008 Gbowee was in a relationship with a Liberian information technology expert whom she identifies as James.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|205-205}} He is the father of her sixth child, a daughter named Jaydyn Thelma Abigail (called \"Nehcopee\" by friends and family), born in New York City in June 2009.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|223}}\n\nIn April 2008, when Gbowee's family and friends gathered to celebrate the 14th birthday of her eldest daughter, Amber, it was clear that Gbowee had developed a serious alcohol problem. In her memoir, Gbowee explains that she had turned to alcohol for about a decade to cope with the loneliness of constant separations from her family, the strain of poverty and war-engendered trauma she suffered from, and the stress of never-ending demands on her time. During Amber's birthday party, Gbowee's children noted that she drank 14 glasses of wine. The next day, she passed out. When again conscious, suffering from an ulcer, she begged James to take her to the doctor: \"Then I saw the kids gathered around us, their terrified, helpless faces. After all their losses, this would be the final one. No. Not possible. It might sound too easy, but that was the end for me. I still don't sleep easily and I still wake up too early, but I don't drink anymore.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|208-209}}\n\n==Religious views==\nGbowee expresses devotion to her Christian faith. She opened the acknowledgment section of her memoir with these words: \"All praise, glory and honor to God for His unfailing love and favor toward me.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|245}} She told students attending an EMU chapel in 2009:\n\n<blockquote>I didn't get there by myself... or anything I did as an individual, but it was by the grace and mercy of God.... He has held my hands. In the most difficult of times, he has been there. They have this song, \"Order my steps in your ways, dear Lord,\" and every day as I wake up, that is my prayer, because there's no way that anyone can take this journey as a peacebuilder, as an agent of change in your community, without having a sense of faith.... As I continue this journey in this life, I remind myself:  All that I am, all that I hope to be, is because of God.<ref name=podcastFaith /></blockquote>\n\nGbowee told the EMU students that she went from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with no idea of what her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997. She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku. Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to \"crippling hopelessness\", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia's brutal warfare. Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step. And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who reached out a hand at just the moment when she was most desperate.<ref name=podcastFaith />\n\nAs suggested by the interfaith character of the Liberian women's movement, Gbowee noted that others may derive the same support from religious faiths different from hers:\n\n<blockquote>It could be Jesus, it could be Mohammed, it could be Buddha, but there is no way that you can effect change in people's lives if there is not someone that you can rely on as the \"divine intervenor\" or the \"divine one\" that you can call on every day.... God is faithful, whoever you know him to me.... Take a step of faith and God will see to the rest.<ref name=podcastFaith /></blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with Odyssey Networks, Gbowee said that God could also be referred to as a \"Higher Power.\" She stressed that with a Higher Power accompanying you, you can \"rise up and do something to change your situation.\" She advised: \"Don't wait for a Gandhi, don't wait for a King, don't wait for a Mandela. ''You'' are your own Mandela, ''you'' are your own Gandhi, ''you'' are your own King.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseynetworks.org/video/Odyssey-Networks-exclusive-interview-with-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize-Laureate-Leymah-Gbowee|title=Odyssey Networks exclusive interview with 2011 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Leymah Gbowee - Odyssey Networks<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=5 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111144546/http://www.odysseynetworks.org/video/Odyssey-Networks-exclusive-interview-with-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize-Laureate-Leymah-Gbowee|archive-date=11 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Documentary film==\nGbowee is the narrator and central character in the 2008 [[documentary film]] ''[[Pray the Devil Back to Hell]]'', which consists of scores of film and audio clips from the war period. It took Best Documentary Feature in the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. It has been broadcast across the United States as part of the \"Women, War & Peace\" series, which aired over five successive Tuesdays in October and early November 2011 on public television stations.<ref>\"Women, War & Peace,\" www.pbs.org/wnet/women-war-and-peace/.

Not the balloons-confetti-cupcakes-clown-type fun, but rather solidarity-inspiring conviviality.

The first, from the [[John F.

In the moments we were calm enough to look around, we had to confront the magnitude of what had happened in Liberia. Two hundred and fifty thousand people were dead, a quarter of them children. One in three were displaced, with 350,000 living in internally displaced persons camps and the rest anywhere they could find shelter. One million people, mostly women and children, were at risk of malnutrition, diarrhea, measles and cholera because of contamination in the wells. More than 75 percent of the country's physical infrastructure, our roads, hospitals and schools, had been destroyed.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|167}}</blockquote>\n\nGbowee expressed particular concern for the \"psychic damage\" borne by Liberians:\n\n<blockquote>A whole generation of young men had no idea who they were without a gun in their hands. Several generations of women were widowed, had been raped, seen their daughters and mothers raped, and their children kill and be killed. Neighbors had turned against neighbors; young people had lost hope, and old people, everything they had painstakingly earned. To a person, we were traumatized.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|168}}</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview for the [[International Women's Day]], Gbowee also expressed:\n\n<blockquote>The Liberian women peace movement demonstrated to the world that grassroots movements are essential to sustaining peace; that women in leadership positions are effective brokers for peace; and the importance of culturally relevant [[social justice]] movements. Liberia's experience is a good example to the world that women\u2014especially African women\u2014can be drivers of peace<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/international-women%C2%B4s-day-interview-leymah-gbowee/|title=International Women\u00b4s Day: Interview With Leymah Gbowee|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2016|date=2014-03-08}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmid the destruction and unending needs, Gbowee was appalled by the arrogance, ignorance and overall cultural insensitivity of the United Nations agencies dispatched to help disarm the country, keep the peace, establish procedures for democratic governance, and initiate rebuilding efforts. \"People who have lived through a terrible conflict may be hungry and desperate, ''but they're not stupid'' (Gbowee's emphasis). They often have very good ideas about how peace can evolve, and they need to be asked.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|171}} Gbowee advocated for involving Liberian civil society, especially women's organizations, in restoring the country. She grew frustrated with the way the \"UN was spending many millions of dollars in Liberia, but most of it was on [their own] staffing resources.... If they had just given some of that money to the local people, it would have made a real difference.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|173}}\n\nBy the late fall and winter of 2003-04, \"the world of conflict resolution, peace-building and the global women's movement\" was calling Gbowee to write papers, come to conferences and otherwise explain the experience and views of WIPNET. Thelma Ekiyor encouraged Gbowee to overcome her lack of self-esteem among \"highly intelligent people who held master's degrees and represented powerful institutions\" by reading and studying further to understand the theories circulating in the world of peacebuilding.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|177}} She read ''The Peace Book'' by Louise Diamond, known for advocating [[multi-track diplomacy]], and ''The Journey Toward Reconciliation'' and ''The Little Book of Conflict Transformation'', both written by [[John Paul Lederach]], the founding director of the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at [[Eastern Mennonite University]].<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|177}} She went to a USAID conference in New York, her first trip out of Africa,<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|174-175}} to a conference in South Africa, and to Switzerland where she dealt with the Nigerian in charge of UN programs in Liberia.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|174-176}}\n\n===Masters degree in peacebuilding===\nIn the late spring of 2004, about eight months after the Ghana-Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, Gbowee made a decision to take college-level courses in the field in which she had been working: \"I'd heard about [[Eastern Mennonite University]] (EMU), an American college with a well-known program in peace-building and conflict resolution. It was a Christian school that emphasized community and service; it had a long-standing relationship with WANEP and a history of recruiting Africans to study there.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}} Her first stint at EMU \u2013 four weeks at its annual Summer Peacebuilding Institute \u2013 were \"a transformative time for me.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}}\n\nGbowee studied with Hizkias Assefa, whose writings she had read five years earlier when she first began working for St. Peter's Lutheran Church on trauma healing. She also studied with [[Howard Zehr]], \"who taught me the concept of restorative justice,\" whereby healing occurred through the joint efforts of victims and offenders to repair the harms done.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178}}  She thought restorative justice was particularly applicable to Africa: \"Restorative justice was...something we could see as ours and not artificially imposed by Westerners. And we needed it, needed that return to tradition. A culture of impunity flourished throughout Africa. People, officials, governments did evil but were never held accountable. More than we needed to punish them, we needed to undo the damage they had done.... When I left EMU, I knew there was more here for me. Somehow I would find a way to come back.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|178-179}}\n\nShe returned for a round-table called Strategies for Trauma Healing and Resilience in the summer of 2005 and then enrolled as a residential, full-time master's degree student in \"conflict transformation and peacebuilding\" at EMU's [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] in 2006-07:<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n<blockquote>At graduate school, I could feel my mind expand, my comprehension deepen. I realized I now could put a formal name, \"strategic peacebuilding,\" to what I'd done instinctively in Liberia.... Many of the other students at EMU had lived through conflict, and there was relief in being among them.... In Harrisonburg, a small old city in the Shenandoah Valley, far from Liberia and its sorrows and people who expected something from me, I didn't have to be strong. Every now and then \u2013 for instance, when I saw a mother with her children \u2013 I would burst into tears. No one at EMU thought that was strange. I met an old man who'd lost his entire family in the Rwandan genocide.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|179}}</blockquote>\n\nIn September 2006, just as Gbowee was embarking on her first full semester of graduate school, she went to New York City to address the UN on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the passage of Resolution 1325, which dealt with protecting women from gender-based violence and involving them in UN-linked peace efforts.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|179}} While in New York, she received a call from [[Abigail Disney]], a descendant of the founders of the Walt Disney Company, a feminist, and a philanthropist. Disney and a collaborator, Gini Reticker, wanted to talk with Gbowee about their desire to make a documentary about how the women of Liberia rallied themselves to force the men to stop battling.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n===Women in Peace and Security Network (WIPSEN)===\nDuring 2006-07 Gbowee also began talking with Ekiyor and Ecoma Alaga (a Nigerian, like Ekiyor) about splitting WIPNET from WANEP, believing the parent organization to be controlled financially by men and wanting the three of them to be fully in charge.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|187}} The founding director of WANEP, Gbowee's old friend Sam Gbaydee Doe, was sympathetic to the three women's desire for structural independence, but he had left WANEP to pursue a PhD in England.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|189}} WANEP was now led by another graduate of the MA in conflict transformation program at EMU, [[Emmanuel Bombande]] of Ghana,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emu.edu/now/peacebuilder/cjp-alumni/emmanuel-bombande/.|title=\u00bb Emmanuel Bombande|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref> who did not agree that the three women owned the WIPNET branch of WANEP and thus would not let it spin off.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|188-189}} As a result, Gbowee and her two colleagues started a new organization, [[Women in Peace and Security Network]] (WIPSEN), also based in Accra, Ghana.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|189}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wipsen-africa.org/wipsen/who/founders/ |title=Founders |website=[[WIPSEN-Africa.org]] |access-date=2020-01-19 }}</ref> Abigail Disney stepped up to help Gbowee raise funds for launching WIPSEN among philanthropists in New York, enabling her to secure $50,000 in seed money.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|202}}\n\n===Personal struggles===\nBy the time Gbowee finished her coursework at EMU on April 30, 2007, and returned to her children in Liberia in May 2007 \u2013 where her parents had been caring for them \u2013 she realized that her nine months away \"nearly broke all of us.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|194}} In Virginia, she had lived with \"a cold that never went away\" and she \"felt panic, sadness, and cold, swirling blackness\" as she faced \"being sued by former friends at WANEP over our desire to move in a new direction.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|200-201}} Her impending graduate degree (conferred at the end of 2007), growing fame, and other changes in her life strained the relationship she had with a Liberian man named Tunde, an employee of international agencies who had functioned as a father figure for her children for a decade, from the early period of the Liberian women's peace movement through Gbowee's graduate studies at EMU<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|203-204}} (for which he had paid the tuition<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|198}}). They broke up and by early 2008 Gbowee was in a relationship with a Liberian information technology expert whom she identifies as James.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|205-205}} He is the father of her sixth child, a daughter named Jaydyn Thelma Abigail (called \"Nehcopee\" by friends and family), born in New York City in June 2009.<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|223}}\n\nIn April 2008, when Gbowee's family and friends gathered to celebrate the 14th birthday of her eldest daughter, Amber, it was clear that Gbowee had developed a serious alcohol problem. In her memoir, Gbowee explains that she had turned to alcohol for about a decade to cope with the loneliness of constant separations from her family, the strain of poverty and war-engendered trauma she suffered from, and the stress of never-ending demands on her time. During Amber's birthday party, Gbowee's children noted that she drank 14 glasses of wine. The next day, she passed out. When again conscious, suffering from an ulcer, she begged James to take her to the doctor: \"Then I saw the kids gathered around us, their terrified, helpless faces. After all their losses, this would be the final one. No. Not possible. It might sound too easy, but that was the end for me. I still don't sleep easily and I still wake up too early, but I don't drink anymore.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|208-209}}\n\n==Religious views==\nGbowee expresses devotion to her Christian faith. She opened the acknowledgment section of her memoir with these words: \"All praise, glory and honor to God for His unfailing love and favor toward me.\"<ref name=\"MightyBe\"/>{{rp|245}} She told students attending an EMU chapel in 2009:\n\n<blockquote>I didn't get there by myself... or anything I did as an individual, but it was by the grace and mercy of God.... He has held my hands. In the most difficult of times, he has been there. They have this song, \"Order my steps in your ways, dear Lord,\" and every day as I wake up, that is my prayer, because there's no way that anyone can take this journey as a peacebuilder, as an agent of change in your community, without having a sense of faith.... As I continue this journey in this life, I remind myself:  All that I am, all that I hope to be, is because of God.<ref name=podcastFaith /></blockquote>\n\nGbowee told the EMU students that she went from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with no idea of what her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997. She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku. Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to \"crippling hopelessness\", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia's brutal warfare. Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step. And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who reached out a hand at just the moment when she was most desperate.<ref name=podcastFaith />\n\nAs suggested by the interfaith character of the Liberian women's movement, Gbowee noted that others may derive the same support from religious faiths different from hers:\n\n<blockquote>It could be Jesus, it could be Mohammed, it could be Buddha, but there is no way that you can effect change in people's lives if there is not someone that you can rely on as the \"divine intervenor\" or the \"divine one\" that you can call on every day.... God is faithful, whoever you know him to me.... Take a step of faith and God will see to the rest.<ref name=podcastFaith /></blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with Odyssey Networks, Gbowee said that God could also be referred to as a \"Higher Power.\" She stressed that with a Higher Power accompanying you, you can \"rise up and do something to change your situation.\" She advised: \"Don't wait for a Gandhi, don't wait for a King, don't wait for a Mandela. ''You'' are your own Mandela, ''you'' are your own Gandhi, ''you'' are your own King.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseynetworks.org/video/Odyssey-Networks-exclusive-interview-with-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize-Laureate-Leymah-Gbowee|title=Odyssey Networks exclusive interview with 2011 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Leymah Gbowee - Odyssey Networks<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=5 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111144546/http://www.odysseynetworks.org/video/Odyssey-Networks-exclusive-interview-with-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize-Laureate-Leymah-Gbowee|archive-date=11 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Documentary film==\nGbowee is the narrator and central character in the 2008 [[documentary film]] ''[[Pray the Devil Back to Hell]]'', which consists of scores of film and audio clips from the war period.
