Hamilton said he supported the introduction of Skoal Bandits on [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] grounds, and lobbied ministers (including [[Edwina Currie]] and [[David Mellor]]) to allow its introduction.

His majority at the 1992 general election had been almost 16,000 votes. In 1997, Tatton was the fourth safest Conservative seat in Britain. Hamilton was under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner as part of the ''cash for questions'' enquiry and some party members thought he should stand down after the collapse of his case against ''The Guardian''.<ref>The 1997 General Election edited by D.

Bell defeated Hamilton, winning by a majority of over 11,000 votes with a swing of 48%. Although Hamilton vowed to return to parliament, this defeat marked the end of his political career in the Conservative Party. In March 1999, [[George Osborne]] was selected by the Tatton Conservative Association to be their candidate for the following general election.\n\n===UK Independence Party===\nIn September 2011, Hamilton attended the annual conference of the [[UK Independence Party]].

Hamilton had given a categorical denial he had made a Nazi salute in Berlin to John Selwyn Gummer, the Party Chairman, in January 1984:\n\n:\"Dear John... I make it absolutely clear that, whilst in Berlin, I did not do any goose-stepping nor did I at any time give Nazi salutes.

Hamilton rejected these findings, whereas Smith, who had stood down, accepted them, apologised for his conduct, and retired from politics altogether.\n\n====The libel action against Al-Fayed====\nHamilton also brought a legal action for libel against Mohamed Al-Fayed. On 16 January 1997, Al-Fayed appeared in an edition of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' documentary series on [[Channel 4]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/030ii/sp0157.htm \"Appendix 33 \u2013 continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases\"], Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997.</ref> He claimed that Hamilton had demanded and had accepted cash payments of up to \u00a3110,000,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/573630.stm \"Hamilton loses libel case\"], ''BBC News'', 21 December 1999.</ref> Harrods' gift vouchers and a free holiday at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] in 1987, in return for asking questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods. While Hamilton did not deny the holiday, he continued to maintain that he was innocent of improper conduct.\n\nOn 31 July 1998, Hamilton's action was approved for a court listing. Funds for the action were donated by [[Lord Harris of High Cross]], the [[Earl of Portsmouth]] and Taki, who raised \u00a350,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/576284.stm \"The odd couple behind the odd couple\"], ''BBC News'', 23 December 1999.</ref> Other contributors to the fund included [[Simon Heffer]], [[Norris McWhirter]], Peter Clarke, [[Lord Bell]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and Gerald Howarth (Hamilton's co-plaintiff in the BBC action). Some Conservative MPs (approximately 40 of the 165) also made contributions. In total, approximately \u00a3410,000 was raised.<ref>''The Independent'', 23 December 1999.</ref>\n\nThe jury trial commenced in November 1999. Hamilton and his wife were cross-examined by [[George Carman]] QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take \u00a310,000 from [[Mobil Oil]] in 1989 for the tabling of an amendment to a finance bill. At the time, Hamilton was a member of a Commons select committee on finance.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/575299.stm |work=BBC News | title=The undoing of Neil Hamilton | date=22 December 1999 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> Al-Fayed said Hamilton had taken the money either in brown envelope cash payments or through Ian Greer.

On 6 November, the committee only partially endorsed Downey's report, but still criticised Hamilton's behaviour whilst an MP.\n\nIn April 2001, Hamilton was refused leave to appeal to the [[House of Lords]]. On 22 May 2001, unable to pay his legal fees and with costs amounting to some \u00a33m, Hamilton declared bankruptcy. He was discharged from bankruptcy in May 2004.\n\n===False rape accusation===\nOn 10 August 2001, the Hamiltons were arrested by police who were investigating an alleged rape. The Hamiltons said they could not have been present at the alleged rape scene because they were hosting a dinner party and produced alibis including one from [[Derek Laud]].<ref>Tara Womersley and Peter Foster, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1337240/Dinner-guests-whose-testimony-will-count.html \"Dinner guests whose testimony will count\"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 13 August 2001.</ref> The investigation against the couple was dropped when it became apparent that the accusations were [[False accusation of rape|entirely false]].

Commenting on Powell's [[Rivers of Blood speech|'Rivers of Blood' speech]] about mass immigration, Hamilton said that Powell was wrong about predicting racial violence, but had been \"proved right by events\" in terms of social change that was \"never desired by the majority of the British people\". Hamilton said that Powell \"changed politics by articulating the fears and resentments of millions and millions of people who are being ignored by the establishment\". In response, the leader of [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Leanne Wood]], accused Hamilton of \"keeping Powell's racist rhetoric going\". Labour AM [[Hefin David]] described Hamilton's comments as \"outrageous\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43783172|title=UKIP Wales leader defends Enoch Powell|date=16 April 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Television personality==\nOn 9 May 1997 Hamilton and his wife, Christine, appeared on the current affairs satire quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. The episode was recorded one week after Hamilton lost his seat. [[Angus Deayton]], the presenter of the [[panel game]], wore a white suit instead of his usual brown one. This was a humorous reference to [[Martin Bell]], who wore just such a suit throughout the 1997 general election campaign. As a further taunt, at the end of the show, the Hamiltons were handed their \"fee\" in brown envelopes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1485042.stm \"'Invincible' Christine at Neil's side\"], ''BBC News'', 10 August 2001.</ref> At one point Hamilton quipped, \"I've found it's much better making political jokes than being one.\"<ref>''Have I Got News for You'', season 13 episode 4.

They have also appeared on programmes such as ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', as well as in [[pantomime]]. In an appearance on a celebrity edition of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' on [[Boxing Day]] 2004, Hamilton described himself as being \"an object of professional curiosity\".

Hamilton had given a categorical denial he had made a Nazi salute in Berlin to John Selwyn Gummer, the Party Chairman, in January 1984:\n\n:\"Dear John... I make it absolutely clear that, whilst in Berlin, I did not do any goose-stepping nor did I at any time give Nazi salutes. Indeed, I have always thought the latter was a criminal offence in the Federal Republic.\"\n\nBut, writing in the ''Sunday Times'', Hamilton admitted making \"a little salute\" in the Reichstag.<ref>Neil Hamilton News in Focus feature, ''Sunday Times'', 26 October 1986<br />David Leigh and Paul Lashmar, Nazi Salute storm refuses to die down\", ''The Observer'', 2 November 1986<br />[[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]], \"Spot the Goose\", ''Daily Mirror'', 3 November 1986.</ref> Hamilton's admission had the effect of reaffirming the testimony of the two witnesses who alleged he had given a Nazi salute in Berlin and exposing those witnesses who had reversed their position.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Dropping of libel action against the Young Conservatives====\nHamilton and Howarth reversed their earlier position and dropped their libel action against Pedley. They said that extracting an apology from Pedley was not \"worth the bother\".<ref>''The Times'', 27 October 1986.</ref> On 3 December 1986, Pedley refused the offered settlement terms and asked for a hearing in open court. Justice Simon Brown ruled that Hamilton and Howarth be debarred from alleging Pedley's words were libel and should pay Pedley's costs.<ref>''The Financial Times'', 4 December 1986<br />[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neil_Hamilton_v_Pedley_Liability_Costs_Panorama_Case.jpeg High Court written judgement], 14 July 1987.</ref>\n\nPedley made a statement from the steps to say he stood by his words in the ''Panorama'' programme and restated he had never said the MPs were Nazis, rather their behaviour was part of a pattern that would harm the Party and in the case of Hamilton's Berlin behaviour, the Final YC Report accused Hamilton of \"batty eccentricity\". On the more substantive allegations, Pedley said he reiterated the points made in the YC Report had been called into question.<blockquote>\"I consider I have the responsibility to vindicate the good work done by the members of that committee. Several have endured abuse and hate mail following publication of their names in the Young National Front paper Bulldog and other extremist papers.

In return, the men were to ask questions on behalf of Al-Fayed in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Smith admitted his guilt and resigned immediately. Hamilton claimed innocence but was forced to resign five days later, on 25 October 1994.\n\n====The action against ''The Guardian''====\nHamilton brought legal action for [[libel]] against ''The Guardian''. Hamilton joined [[Ian Greer (lobbyist)|Ian Greer]], a parliamentary lobbyist, as a co-plaintiff. In the process, the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] was amended by the [[Defamation Act 1996]] to allow statements made in Parliament to be questioned in court.<ref>Robert Shrimsley, \"Guardian Case MP seeks law change\", ''Financial Times'', 15 February 1996<br />{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1468-2230.00087 | volume=60 | issue=3 | title='Only Flattery is Safe': Political Speech and the Defamation Act 1996 | year=1997 | journal=Modern Law Review | pages=388\u2013393 | last1 = Williams | first1 = Kevin}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 1996, the day before the start of the trial, Hamilton and Greer settled, citing a conflict of interest and lack of funds. ''The Guardian'' greeted the Hamilton collapse with the headline 'A Liar and a Cheat'. Alan Rusbridger, editor of ''The Guardian'', said, \"The decision by Neil Hamilton and Ian Greer must be one of the most astonishing legal cave-ins in the history of the law of libel\" and called for the issues to be examined by Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and the Inland Revenue.<ref>David Hencke, David Leigh and David Pallister, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1996/oct/01/hamiltonvalfayed.davidhencke \"A Liar and a Cheat\"], ''The Guardian'', 1 October 1996.</ref>\nThey each paid \u00a37,500 towards the paper's legal costs.

Hamilton vowed that if the \"Downey report\" found against him, he would resign.\n\n[[Edwina Currie]], a former health minister, gave evidence. She told the inquiry that, in May 1988, Hamilton had been unmoved by a set of photographs that depicted smoking related cancers; that is, harm to young people which might be caused by a product (tobacco) that he promoted.<ref>''The Independent'', 5 July 1997.</ref> Hamilton argued the pictures were irrelevant.

Hamilton received over \u00a325,000 and had deliberately misled Michael Heseltine, then [[President of the Board of Trade]], in October 1994, when he said he had no financial relationship with Ian Greer.

The Independent wrote, \"Sir Gordon, contrary to Hamilton's confident expectations, had no compunction about concluding that he did indeed take cash in brown envelopes\" and called on the new party leader to \"expel the miscreants\".<ref name=IndDM/> Hamilton, Smith (also found guilty), Brown and [[Michael Grylls]] were harshly criticised. If Hamilton and Smith had remained in parliament, Downey said he might have recommended long periods of suspension for both. Hamilton rejected these findings, whereas Smith, who had stood down, accepted them, apologised for his conduct, and retired from politics altogether.\n\n====The libel action against Al-Fayed====\nHamilton also brought a legal action for libel against Mohamed Al-Fayed. On 16 January 1997, Al-Fayed appeared in an edition of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' documentary series on [[Channel 4]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/030ii/sp0157.htm \"Appendix 33 \u2013 continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases\"], Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997.</ref> He claimed that Hamilton had demanded and had accepted cash payments of up to \u00a3110,000,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/573630.stm \"Hamilton loses libel case\"], ''BBC News'', 21 December 1999.</ref> Harrods' gift vouchers and a free holiday at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] in 1987, in return for asking questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods. While Hamilton did not deny the holiday, he continued to maintain that he was innocent of improper conduct.\n\nOn 31 July 1998, Hamilton's action was approved for a court listing. Funds for the action were donated by [[Lord Harris of High Cross]], the [[Earl of Portsmouth]] and Taki, who raised \u00a350,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/576284.stm \"The odd couple behind the odd couple\"], ''BBC News'', 23 December 1999.</ref> Other contributors to the fund included [[Simon Heffer]], [[Norris McWhirter]], Peter Clarke, [[Lord Bell]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and Gerald Howarth (Hamilton's co-plaintiff in the BBC action). Some Conservative MPs (approximately 40 of the 165) also made contributions. In total, approximately \u00a3410,000 was raised.<ref>''The Independent'', 23 December 1999.</ref>\n\nThe jury trial commenced in November 1999. Hamilton and his wife were cross-examined by [[George Carman]] QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take \u00a310,000 from [[Mobil Oil]] in 1989 for the tabling of an amendment to a finance bill.

On 6 November, the committee only partially endorsed Downey's report, but still criticised Hamilton's behaviour whilst an MP.\n\nIn April 2001, Hamilton was refused leave to appeal to the [[House of Lords]]. On 22 May 2001, unable to pay his legal fees and with costs amounting to some \u00a33m, Hamilton declared bankruptcy. He was discharged from bankruptcy in May 2004.\n\n===False rape accusation===\nOn 10 August 2001, the Hamiltons were arrested by police who were investigating an alleged rape.

The Greeley/Evans area is bounded on the south by the [[South Platte River]], and the [[Cache la Poudre River]] flows through north Greeley. The city is served by [[U.S. Highway 85 (Colorado)|US Route 85]] and [[U.S. Highway 34 (Colorado)|US Route 34]].<ref>''Colorado Atlas & Gazetteer,'' DeLorme, 12th ed. 2015, p. 31  {{ISBN|0899332889}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|30.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|29.9|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} (0.30%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Greeley, CO, September 19, 2013 (12441526333).jpg|thumb|Flooding in Greeley in 2013]]\nGreeley experiences a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk''). High temperatures are generally around 90\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the summer and 40-45&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter, although significant variation occurs. The hottest days generally occur around the third week of July and the coldest in January. Nighttime lows are near 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the summer and around 15\u201320&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22129&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter. Record high temperatures of 112&nbsp;\u00b0F (44.4&nbsp;\u00b0C) have been recorded, as have record low temperatures of \u201325&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u201332&nbsp;\u00b0C). The first freeze typically occurs around October 10 and the last can happen as late as May 4. [[Extratropical cyclone]]s which disrupt the weather for the eastern two-thirds of the US often originate in or near Colorado, which means Greeley does not experience many fully developed storm systems. Warm fronts, sleet, and freezing rain are practically nonexistent here. In addition, the city's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and lower elevation, compared to the mountains west of the city, result in less precipitation and fewer [[thunderstorm]]s. This is paradoxical, because adjacent areas (mostly farmland) experience between 7 and 9 [[hail]] days per year.<ref>[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html UCAR: Hail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015141754/http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html |date=2009-10-15 }}.</ref>\n\nThe climate in Greeley, as well as all of Colorado, is extremely dry. The [[Chinook wind]]s coming off the mountains often raise temperatures to near 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in April. Greeley's elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C), even in the hottest part of the summer. The diurnal temperature range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall. Rapid day-to-day and [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] fluctuation in temperature is also common.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Greeley, Colorado\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  74\n|Feb record high F =  76\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record high F =  92\n|May record high F =  101\n|Jun record high F = 110\n|Jul record high F = 112\n|Aug record high F = 106\n|Sep record high F = 102\n|Oct record high F =  92\n|Nov record high F =  84\n|Dec record high F =  76\n|year record high F =112\n|Jan high F = 46.0\n|Feb high F = 50.0\n|Mar high F = 60.0\n|Apr high F = 67.9\n|May high F = 77.3\n|Jun high F = 87.3\n|Jul high F = 93.8\n|Aug high F = 91.4\n|Sep high F = 83.0\n|Oct high F = 69.7\n|Nov high F = 55.1\n|Dec high F = 44.7\n|year high F =68.9\n|Jan low F = 16.6\n|Feb low F = 20.0\n|Mar low F = 27.6\n|Apr low F = 35.1\n|May low F = 44.6\n|Jun low F = 53.1\n|Jul low F = 58.6\n|Aug low F = 56.9\n|Sep low F = 47.6\n|Oct low F = 36.0\n|Nov low F = 25.3\n|Dec low F = 16.6\n|year low F =36.5\n|Jan record low F = \u221225\n|Feb record low F = \u221220\n|Mar record low F =  \u22124\n|Apr record low F =  \u22123\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  35\n|Jul record low F =  42\n|Aug record low F =  41\n|Sep record low F =  17\n|Oct record low F =   5\n|Nov record low F =  \u22127\n|Dec record low F = \u221224\n|year record low F= \u221225\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.48\n|Feb precipitation inch = 0.40\n|Mar precipitation inch = 1.12\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.81\n|May precipitation inch = 2.39\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.93\n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.68\n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.46\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.11\n|Oct precipitation inch = 1.01\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.74\n|Dec precipitation inch = 0.56\n|Jan snow inch = 5.6\n|Feb snow inch = 5.0\n|Mar snow inch = 5.5\n|Apr snow inch = 3.1\n|May snow inch = 0.8\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.3\n|Oct snow inch = 2.4\n|Nov snow inch = 4.0\n|Dec snow inch = 8.0\n|source 1= [[NOAA]]<ref name= NOAA >{{cite web |url=http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=bou |title=NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=August 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n|date=August 2015\n}}\n\n{{Geographic Location\n | Centre    = Greeley\n | North     = [[Eaton, Colorado|Eaton]]\n | Northeast = \n | East      = [[Kersey, Colorado|Kersey]]\n | Southeast = \n | South     = [[Evans, Colorado|Evans]]\n | Southwest = [[Milliken, Colorado|Milliken]]\n | West      = [[Loveland, Colorado|Loveland]]\n | Northwest = [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 480\n|1880= 1297\n|1890= 2395\n|1900= 3023\n|1910= 8179\n|1920= 10958\n|1930= 12203\n|1940= 15995\n|1950= 20354\n|1960= 26314\n|1970= 38902\n|1980= 53006\n|1990= 60536\n|2000= 76930\n|2010= 92889\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=107348\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\" />\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the 2010 census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234526/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-02-12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-03 }},U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census; accessed 3/27/14</ref> there were 92,889 people, 33,427 households, and 21,250 families residing in the city.

The stagecoach station was at the confluence of the [[South Platte River]] and the [[Cache la Poudre River]]. It is believed that here occurred the birth of the [[first white child]] born in Colorado, a girl. Fort Latham was the headquarters of the government troops during the Indian conflicts of 1860\u20131864 and the county seat (the post office being called Latham).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/District/Custom.cfm?District_ID=19&Page_ID=319|title=Colorado Judicial Branch|publisher=courts.state.co.us}}</ref>\n\n===Union Colony===\n{{Main|Union Colony of Colorado}}\n[[File:Union Colony Civic Center.jpg|thumb|The Union Colony Civic Center, a performing arts facility in Greeley.]]\nGreeley began as the Union Colony, which was founded in 1869 as an experimental utopian community \"based on temperance, religion, agriculture, education and family values.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeleyhistory.org/index.html |title=Greeley, Colorado History for Kids |publisher=Greeleyhistory.org |date=2013-07-21 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> by [[Nathan C.

The Greeley/Evans area is bounded on the south by the [[South Platte River]], and the [[Cache la Poudre River]] flows through north Greeley. The city is served by [[U.S. Highway 85 (Colorado)|US Route 85]] and [[U.S. Highway 34 (Colorado)|US Route 34]].<ref>''Colorado Atlas & Gazetteer,'' DeLorme, 12th ed. 2015, p. 31  {{ISBN|0899332889}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|30.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|29.9|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} (0.30%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Greeley, CO, September 19, 2013 (12441526333).jpg|thumb|Flooding in Greeley in 2013]]\nGreeley experiences a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk''). High temperatures are generally around 90\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the summer and 40-45&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter, although significant variation occurs. The hottest days generally occur around the third week of July and the coldest in January. Nighttime lows are near 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the summer and around 15\u201320&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22129&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter. Record high temperatures of 112&nbsp;\u00b0F (44.4&nbsp;\u00b0C) have been recorded, as have record low temperatures of \u201325&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u201332&nbsp;\u00b0C). The first freeze typically occurs around October 10 and the last can happen as late as May 4. [[Extratropical cyclone]]s which disrupt the weather for the eastern two-thirds of the US often originate in or near Colorado, which means Greeley does not experience many fully developed storm systems. Warm fronts, sleet, and freezing rain are practically nonexistent here. In addition, the city's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and lower elevation, compared to the mountains west of the city, result in less precipitation and fewer [[thunderstorm]]s. This is paradoxical, because adjacent areas (mostly farmland) experience between 7 and 9 [[hail]] days per year.<ref>[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html UCAR: Hail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015141754/http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html |date=2009-10-15 }}.</ref>\n\nThe climate in Greeley, as well as all of Colorado, is extremely dry. The [[Chinook wind]]s coming off the mountains often raise temperatures to near 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in April. Greeley's elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C), even in the hottest part of the summer. The diurnal temperature range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall. Rapid day-to-day and [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] fluctuation in temperature is also common.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Greeley, Colorado\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  74\n|Feb record high F =  76\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record high F =  92\n|May record high F =  101\n|Jun record high F = 110\n|Jul record high F = 112\n|Aug record high F = 106\n|Sep record high F = 102\n|Oct record high F =  92\n|Nov record high F =  84\n|Dec record high F =  76\n|year record high F =112\n|Jan high F = 46.0\n|Feb high F = 50.0\n|Mar high F = 60.0\n|Apr high F = 67.9\n|May high F = 77.3\n|Jun high F = 87.3\n|Jul high F = 93.8\n|Aug high F = 91.4\n|Sep high F = 83.0\n|Oct high F = 69.7\n|Nov high F = 55.1\n|Dec high F = 44.7\n|year high F =68.9\n|Jan low F = 16.6\n|Feb low F = 20.0\n|Mar low F = 27.6\n|Apr low F = 35.1\n|May low F = 44.6\n|Jun low F = 53.1\n|Jul low F = 58.6\n|Aug low F = 56.9\n|Sep low F = 47.6\n|Oct low F = 36.0\n|Nov low F = 25.3\n|Dec low F = 16.6\n|year low F =36.5\n|Jan record low F = \u221225\n|Feb record low F = \u221220\n|Mar record low F =  \u22124\n|Apr record low F =  \u22123\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  35\n|Jul record low F =  42\n|Aug record low F =  41\n|Sep record low F =  17\n|Oct record low F =   5\n|Nov record low F =  \u22127\n|Dec record low F = \u221224\n|year record low F= \u221225\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.48\n|Feb precipitation inch = 0.40\n|Mar precipitation inch = 1.12\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.81\n|May precipitation inch = 2.39\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.93\n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.68\n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.46\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.11\n|Oct precipitation inch = 1.01\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.74\n|Dec precipitation inch = 0.56\n|Jan snow inch = 5.6\n|Feb snow inch = 5.0\n|Mar snow inch = 5.5\n|Apr snow inch = 3.1\n|May snow inch = 0.8\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.3\n|Oct snow inch = 2.4\n|Nov snow inch = 4.0\n|Dec snow inch = 8.0\n|source 1= [[NOAA]]<ref name= NOAA >{{cite web |url=http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=bou |title=NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=August 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n|date=August 2015\n}}\n\n{{Geographic Location\n | Centre    = Greeley\n | North     = [[Eaton, Colorado|Eaton]]\n | Northeast = \n | East      = [[Kersey, Colorado|Kersey]]\n | Southeast = \n | South     = [[Evans, Colorado|Evans]]\n | Southwest = [[Milliken, Colorado|Milliken]]\n | West      = [[Loveland, Colorado|Loveland]]\n | Northwest = [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 480\n|1880= 1297\n|1890= 2395\n|1900= 3023\n|1910= 8179\n|1920= 10958\n|1930= 12203\n|1940= 15995\n|1950= 20354\n|1960= 26314\n|1970= 38902\n|1980= 53006\n|1990= 60536\n|2000= 76930\n|2010= 92889\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=107348\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\" />\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the 2010 census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234526/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-02-12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-03 }},U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census; accessed 3/27/14</ref> there were 92,889 people, 33,427 households, and 21,250 families residing in the city.
