George Mason University</ref> Basketball and athletics as a whole have contributed significantly to George Mason's popularity and success. The Patriots are the mascot and logo of [[George Mason University]]. The Patriots home court for both the men and women is at the [[EagleBank Arena]], which is in Fairfax Virginia. The Patriots compete in the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. Until 2012\u201313, they competed in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], better known as the CAA. Both conferences are part of NCAA Division I sports. The men's team is coached by [[Dave Paulsen]]. The women's team is coached by [[Nyla Milleson]].\n\n==History==\nThe Patriots made a transition from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] to the National Collegiate Athletic Association [[NCAA]] Division II, and subsequently into the NCAA Division I rank in the 1978\u201379 season. According to the history of George Mason basketball,<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\">\"[[George Mason Patriots]]\". Levineps. March 27, 2006.</ref> both the men's and women's basketball program have been fixtures of campus life, and have all been enjoyed by students, parents, faculty, staff, other alumni. Although many of the school's athletic programs are enjoyed by George Mason Patriots and have had many of their own memorable moments, the men's basketball program remains the key sport at the University. The men's basketball team has played at the Patriot Center since 1985, and in prior years played at the PE Building on the west side of the Fairfax Campus.<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\"/>  George Mason has sent 3 players to the NBA since 1979.  Those being Rob Rose, Ricky Wilson, and Jason Miskiri.  George Mason has had numerous basketball players pursue post-college basketball careers overseas over the years, with many George Mason basketball alums still currently continuing their basketball careers overseas.\n\n===NCAA Tournament appearances===\n'''Men's'''\n* Basketball (6), [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]], [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]], [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006]], [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]]<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\"/> [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]].\n\nThe Patriots have advanced to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] six times (1989, 1999, 2001, 2006,2008, and 2011) and the NIT tournament (National Invitation tournament) three times (1986, 2002 and 2004).<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\"/> The basketball team is best known for its 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] appearance where Mason beat [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], [[Connecticut]], [[Michigan State]], and [[Wichita State]]. The Patriots lost to eventual champion Florida in the Final Four. After the Patriots run in the 2005\u20132006 season, and their successful finish in the 2007\u20132008 season, George Mason Head Coach [[Jim Larranaga]] was offered to leave Mason for a 5-year, $4.25 million offer from Providence College. Coach Larranaga announced his decision in April 2008 by declining the offer from Providence, and extending his current contract with Mason to 2015.<ref>[http://www.caazone.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16889&Itemid=226 \"     Larranaga Rejects Big East's Providence College\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701133538/http://www.caazone.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16889&Itemid=226 |date=2008-07-01 }}. Metsala, C: .

That season the patriots were ranked top 25 in the USA Today and ESPN polls for the very first time. George Mason was ranked #8 in the final NCAA Basketball polls that year, making that Mason's highest ever ranking in men's basketball.  George Mason was nominated for 2 ESPY awards by ESPN.  The Patriots were nominated for an ESPY in the category of \"Best Moment,\" for making the Final Four after downing three highly favored opponents. The run to the Final Four, which ESPN says is \"considered by most the greatest in NCAA Tournament history\", culminated with the Patriots beating top-seeded Connecticut 86\u201384 in overtime on March 26 to advance to the school, and the CAA conference's first-ever Final Four. George Mason also defeated Michigan State, North Carolina, and Wichita State in the NCAA Tournament while defeating the University of Connecticut in the Elite 8 to earn a trip to the Final Four in Indianapolis.  George Mason would later fall to the eventual National Champion, University of Florida, in the Final Four game.  While the Patriots were nominated for their virtuoso performance, the man who helped conduct the orchestra was also nominated for an ESPY as George Mason head men's basketball coach Jim Larranaga was nominated in the \"Best Coach/Manager\" category.\n\nAfter the 2005\u20132006 season Head coach [[Jim Larranaga]] was named [[Virginia Coach of the Year]] on June 26, 2006.<ref>[http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033006aab.html \"     Larranaga Receives Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212353/http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033006aab.html |date=2011-07-08 }}.Gomason.com: . March 30, 2006.</ref> George Mason was one of only three teams since 1982 without a tournament win in its school history to still enter the final four. Georgia did it in 1983, and Virginia did it in 1981. During the 2005\u20132006 season the final four had a bigger following than the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[NBA Playoffs]] that year. The main following came from office pools and parties in houses, dorms, and bars.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Y70WBdH6tQC&pg=RA2-PA223&dq=george+mason+final+four&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&sig=tEc-G3NHkLfNr8Hqjf4dCe62nts     March to Madness\"].Zullo, A: Introduction. 2007.</ref>\n\n==George Mason women's basketball==\nIn 2008, news broke out that women's basketball coach [[Debbie Taneyhill]] decided to resign to pursue other opportunities.\nCoach Taneyhill spent 11 seasons as Mason's women's basketball head coach, and had much success with the ladies. During Taneyhill's tenure as coach, she helped the lady Patriots to four-straight winning campaigns, from the 2000 to the 2004 season. She also led them to two post-season appearances in the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament]], WNIT in 2001 and 2004, and was named 2001 Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year. \nShe was the sixth coach in George Mason's 33-year history, and was the only head coach to have 10 or more wins in each of her first eight seasons. She led the Patriots to the 2004 CAA Championship title game for just the third time in school history. Taneyhill ranks second all-time among Mason coaches in both wins and games coached.\nDuring the 2005\u20132006 season [[George Mason University]] was selected to host the Colonial Athletic Association Women's Basketball Championship, to be played at the [[Patriot Center]]. It was the first time that George Mason served as host to the women's championship. In 2003 Mason Guard [[Jen Derevjanik]] advanced to the [[WNBA]] (Women's National Basketball association). Derevjanik is one of few players ever in Mason's history to play in the WNBA. Jen wrapped up her second season with the WNBA's [[Connecticut Sun]] in 2005, where the Sun's competed in the WNBA finals for the second straight season. Derevjanik is the first Mason player to be part of a team that has advanced to the WNBA Finals.<ref>[http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/060606aaa.html \"     Derevjanik Signs With Phoenix Mercury\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829134037/http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/060606aaa.html |date=2008-08-29 }}.Gomason.com: .

George Mason University</ref> Basketball and athletics as a whole have contributed significantly to George Mason's popularity and success. The Patriots are the mascot and logo of [[George Mason University]]. The Patriots home court for both the men and women is at the [[EagleBank Arena]], which is in Fairfax Virginia. The Patriots compete in the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. Until 2012\u201313, they competed in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], better known as the CAA. Both conferences are part of NCAA Division I sports. The men's team is coached by [[Dave Paulsen]]. The women's team is coached by [[Nyla Milleson]].\n\n==History==\nThe Patriots made a transition from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] to the National Collegiate Athletic Association [[NCAA]] Division II, and subsequently into the NCAA Division I rank in the 1978\u201379 season. According to the history of George Mason basketball,<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\">\"[[George Mason Patriots]]\". Levineps. March 27, 2006.</ref> both the men's and women's basketball program have been fixtures of campus life, and have all been enjoyed by students, parents, faculty, staff, other alumni. Although many of the school's athletic programs are enjoyed by George Mason Patriots and have had many of their own memorable moments, the men's basketball program remains the key sport at the University. The men's basketball team has played at the Patriot Center since 1985, and in prior years played at the PE Building on the west side of the Fairfax Campus.<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\"/>  George Mason has sent 3 players to the NBA since 1979.  Those being Rob Rose, Ricky Wilson, and Jason Miskiri.  George Mason has had numerous basketball players pursue post-college basketball careers overseas over the years, with many George Mason basketball alums still currently continuing their basketball careers overseas.\n\n===NCAA Tournament appearances===\n'''Men's'''\n* Basketball (6), [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]], [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]], [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006]], [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]]<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\"/> [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]].\n\nThe Patriots have advanced to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] six times (1989, 1999, 2001, 2006,2008, and 2011) and the NIT tournament (National Invitation tournament) three times (1986, 2002 and 2004).<ref name=\"Levineps 2006\"/> The basketball team is best known for its 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] appearance where Mason beat [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], [[Connecticut]], [[Michigan State]], and [[Wichita State]]. The Patriots lost to eventual champion Florida in the Final Four. After the Patriots run in the 2005\u20132006 season, and their successful finish in the 2007\u20132008 season, George Mason Head Coach [[Jim Larranaga]] was offered to leave Mason for a 5-year, $4.25 million offer from Providence College. Coach Larranaga announced his decision in April 2008 by declining the offer from Providence, and extending his current contract with Mason to 2015.<ref>[http://www.caazone.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16889&Itemid=226 \"     Larranaga Rejects Big East's Providence College\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701133538/http://www.caazone.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16889&Itemid=226 |date=2008-07-01 }}.

That season the patriots were ranked top 25 in the USA Today and ESPN polls for the very first time. George Mason was ranked #8 in the final NCAA Basketball polls that year, making that Mason's highest ever ranking in men's basketball.  George Mason was nominated for 2 ESPY awards by ESPN.  The Patriots were nominated for an ESPY in the category of \"Best Moment,\" for making the Final Four after downing three highly favored opponents. The run to the Final Four, which ESPN says is \"considered by most the greatest in NCAA Tournament history\", culminated with the Patriots beating top-seeded Connecticut 86\u201384 in overtime on March 26 to advance to the school, and the CAA conference's first-ever Final Four. George Mason also defeated Michigan State, North Carolina, and Wichita State in the NCAA Tournament while defeating the University of Connecticut in the Elite 8 to earn a trip to the Final Four in Indianapolis.  George Mason would later fall to the eventual National Champion, University of Florida, in the Final Four game.  While the Patriots were nominated for their virtuoso performance, the man who helped conduct the orchestra was also nominated for an ESPY as George Mason head men's basketball coach Jim Larranaga was nominated in the \"Best Coach/Manager\" category.\n\nAfter the 2005\u20132006 season Head coach [[Jim Larranaga]] was named [[Virginia Coach of the Year]] on June 26, 2006.<ref>[http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033006aab.html \"     Larranaga Receives Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212353/http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033006aab.html |date=2011-07-08 }}.Gomason.com: .

Georgia did it in 1983, and Virginia did it in 1981. During the 2005\u20132006 season the final four had a bigger following than the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[NBA Playoffs]] that year. The main following came from office pools and parties in houses, dorms, and bars.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Y70WBdH6tQC&pg=RA2-PA223&dq=george+mason+final+four&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&sig=tEc-G3NHkLfNr8Hqjf4dCe62nts     March to Madness\"].Zullo, A: Introduction. 2007.</ref>\n\n==George Mason women's basketball==\nIn 2008, news broke out that women's basketball coach [[Debbie Taneyhill]] decided to resign to pursue other opportunities.\nCoach Taneyhill spent 11 seasons as Mason's women's basketball head coach, and had much success with the ladies. During Taneyhill's tenure as coach, she helped the lady Patriots to four-straight winning campaigns, from the 2000 to the 2004 season. She also led them to two post-season appearances in the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament]], WNIT in 2001 and 2004, and was named 2001 Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year. \nShe was the sixth coach in George Mason's 33-year history, and was the only head coach to have 10 or more wins in each of her first eight seasons. She led the Patriots to the 2004 CAA Championship title game for just the third time in school history. Taneyhill ranks second all-time among Mason coaches in both wins and games coached.\nDuring the 2005\u20132006 season [[George Mason University]] was selected to host the Colonial Athletic Association Women's Basketball Championship, to be played at the [[Patriot Center]]. It was the first time that George Mason served as host to the women's championship. In 2003 Mason Guard [[Jen Derevjanik]] advanced to the [[WNBA]] (Women's National Basketball association). Derevjanik is one of few players ever in Mason's history to play in the WNBA. Jen wrapped up her second season with the WNBA's [[Connecticut Sun]] in 2005, where the Sun's competed in the WNBA finals for the second straight season. Derevjanik is the first Mason player to be part of a team that has advanced to the WNBA Finals.<ref>[http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/060606aaa.html \"     Derevjanik Signs With Phoenix Mercury\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829134037/http://gomason.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/060606aaa.html |date=2008-08-29 }}.Gomason.com: .

The screenplay by [[John Lee Hancock]] was based on [[John Berendt]]'s 1994 [[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil|book of the same name]] and follows the story of an antiques dealer on trial for the murder of a male prostitute.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Mercer House 2017.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mercer House (Savannah, Georgia)|Mercer House]]. The alleged murder of [[Shooting of Danny Hansford|Billy Hanson]] occurred in Williams' study \u2013 the bottom left room in this photograph. The house is now known as the Mercer Williams House Museum]]\n\nThe panoramic tale of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]'s eccentricities focuses on a murder and the subsequent trial of [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]] ([[Kevin Spacey]]), a [[self-made man]], art collector, antiques dealer, bon vivant, and semi-closeted homosexual. John Kelso ([[John Cusack]]), a magazine reporter with one book \u2014 ''Before the Fall'' \u2014 to his name, finds himself in Savannah amid the beautiful architecture and odd doings to write a feature for ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' on one of Williams' famous Christmas parties.\n\nKelso is intrigued by Williams from the start, but his curiosity is piqued when he meets the violent, young Billy Hanson ([[Jude Law]]), Williams' lover.  Later that night, Hanson is dead, and Kelso stays on to cover the murder trial. Along the way he encounters the irrepressible [[The Lady Chablis]], a [[transgender]] entertainer; [[Sonny Seiler]], lawyer to Williams, whose famous dog, [[Uga (dog)|Uga IV]], is the official mascot of the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]; a man who keeps flies attached to mini leashes on his lapels and threatens daily to poison the water supply; Serena Dawes, a former silent-film actress; the Married Ladies Card Club; and Minerva, a spiritualist and [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo practitioner]].\n\nBetween becoming Williams' friend, cuddling up to a [[Torch song#Torch singers|torch singer]], meeting every eccentric in Savannah, participating in midnight graveyard rituals, and helping solve the mysteries surrounding Hanson's murder, Kelso has his hands full. The judge and jury later find Williams not guilty, much to the pleasure of Kelso and the witnesses. Williams congratulates Kelso on proving his innocence.\n\nAs depicted in the book, Williams suffers a heart attack and dies a week after the trial concludes. As he dies on the floor near where Hanson died from his wounds, Williams sees an apparition of the hustler in death, then momentarily alive.  The camera cuts away from the scene, showing both Hanson and Williams dead and only a few feet from each other. Following the funeral and visiting Hanson's grave once more with Minerva, Kelso, Mandy and the Lady Chablis go off together for a picnic with Uga.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as John Kelso\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]]\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Sonny Seiler\n* [[Irma P.

Many unused characters were eliminated or combined into composite ones. John Berendt states at the end of his book: \"All the characters in this book are real, but it bears mentioning that I have used pseudonyms for a number of them in order to protect their privacy.\" To create further distance, several character names in the movie are different than in the book.\n\n*John Berendt was removed from the journalistic role; the fictional John Kelso was introduced in his place\n*Danny Hansford is renamed Billy Hanson in the film\n*Lee Adler, the former member of the [[Telfair Museums]] board, becomes Lorne Atwell\n*George Oliver, the judge in Williams' trial, is now Samuel L.

Williams' real life attorney, [[Sonny Seiler]], played Samuel L. White, the presiding judge of the trial. Seiler was originally cast as a juror, but Eastwood persuaded him to take on the role of the judge. \"I said, 'I'm not an actor,' and Clint said, 'Of course you are. All lawyers are actors, and you are one of the best. If you do this for me, I won\u2019t have to hire a dialect coach.'\"<ref>[https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/travel/2014/06/20/midnight-in-savannah-20-years-later/ \"\u2018Midnight\u2019 in Savannah \u2014 20 years later\"] - ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', June 20, 2014</ref> Seiler's daughter, Bess Thompson, appears in the movie as the \"pretty girl\"<ref>As listed in the film's credits</ref> in [[Forsyth Park]] who asks if she can have her picture taken with Uga.<ref name=sn>[https://www.savannahnow.com/article/20091109/NEWS/311099883 \"People who were there fill \u2018Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\u2019\"] - Savannah Now, November 9, 2009</ref>\n\n===Advertising===\nAdvertising for the film became a source of controversy when [[Warner Bros.]] used elements of [[Jack Leigh]]'s famous photograph in the posters without permission, infringing copyright law.<ref>Paul Siegel {{google books|E6saibxgIN4C|Communication Law in America|page=213}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n\n[[File:115 East Jones Street.jpg|thumb|115 East Jones Street, built in 1853, was the venue for Joe Odom's party]]\n\nWhile entertaining the role of being the film's director, Clint Eastwood visited [[Savannah, Georgia]], where the entire film would be shot, in 1996. \"I didn't get to know too many people at that time \u2014 mostly places \u2014 but I did meet some people who knew about the Jim Williams episode.

The screenplay by [[John Lee Hancock]] was based on [[John Berendt]]'s 1994 [[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil|book of the same name]] and follows the story of an antiques dealer on trial for the murder of a male prostitute.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Mercer House 2017.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mercer House (Savannah, Georgia)|Mercer House]]. The alleged murder of [[Shooting of Danny Hansford|Billy Hanson]] occurred in Williams' study \u2013 the bottom left room in this photograph. The house is now known as the Mercer Williams House Museum]]\n\nThe panoramic tale of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]'s eccentricities focuses on a murder and the subsequent trial of [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]] ([[Kevin Spacey]]), a [[self-made man]], art collector, antiques dealer, bon vivant, and semi-closeted homosexual. John Kelso ([[John Cusack]]), a magazine reporter with one book \u2014 ''Before the Fall'' \u2014 to his name, finds himself in Savannah amid the beautiful architecture and odd doings to write a feature for ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' on one of Williams' famous Christmas parties.\n\nKelso is intrigued by Williams from the start, but his curiosity is piqued when he meets the violent, young Billy Hanson ([[Jude Law]]), Williams' lover.  Later that night, Hanson is dead, and Kelso stays on to cover the murder trial. Along the way he encounters the irrepressible [[The Lady Chablis]], a [[transgender]] entertainer; [[Sonny Seiler]], lawyer to Williams, whose famous dog, [[Uga (dog)|Uga IV]], is the official mascot of the [[Georgia Bulldogs]]; a man who keeps flies attached to mini leashes on his lapels and threatens daily to poison the water supply; Serena Dawes, a former silent-film actress; the Married Ladies Card Club; and Minerva, a spiritualist and [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo practitioner]].\n\nBetween becoming Williams' friend, cuddling up to a [[Torch song#Torch singers|torch singer]], meeting every eccentric in Savannah, participating in midnight graveyard rituals, and helping solve the mysteries surrounding Hanson's murder, Kelso has his hands full. The judge and jury later find Williams not guilty, much to the pleasure of Kelso and the witnesses. Williams congratulates Kelso on proving his innocence.\n\nAs depicted in the book, Williams suffers a heart attack and dies a week after the trial concludes. As he dies on the floor near where Hanson died from his wounds, Williams sees an apparition of the hustler in death, then momentarily alive.  The camera cuts away from the scene, showing both Hanson and Williams dead and only a few feet from each other. Following the funeral and visiting Hanson's grave once more with Minerva, Kelso, Mandy and the Lady Chablis go off together for a picnic with Uga.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as John Kelso\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]]\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Sonny Seiler\n* [[Irma P.

Seiler was originally cast as a juror, but Eastwood persuaded him to take on the role of the judge. \"I said, 'I'm not an actor,' and Clint said, 'Of course you are.

Most of them (with the exception of Ivan Hadzhinikolov) were closely connected with the [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki]]. According to Hristo Tatarchev's \"Memoirs\", IMRO was first called simply the '''Macedonian Revolutionary Organization''' ('''MRO'''). Ivan Hadzhinikolov in his memoirs lists the five basic principles of the MRO's foundation:\n\n{{quotation|\n# The revolutionary organization should be established within Macedonia and should act there so that the Greeks and Serbs couldn't label it as a tool of the Bulgarian government.\n# Its founders should be locals and living in Macedonia.\n# The political motto of the organization should be the autonomy of Macedonia.\n# The organization should be secret and independent, without any links with the governments of the liberated neighbor states, and\n# From the Macedonian immigrants in Bulgaria and the Bulgarian society, only moral and material help for the struggle of the Macedonian revolutionaries should be required.|{{ref|Hadzhinikolov}}}}\n[[File:Hristo Tatar\u010dev.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Hristo Tatarchev]].]]\n\nAccording to Dr. [[Hristo Tatarchev]]:\n\n{{quotation|We talked a long time about the goal of this organization and at last we fixed it on the autonomy of Macedonia with the priority of the Bulgarian element. We couldn't accept the position for \"direct joining to Bulgaria\" because we saw that it would meet big difficulties by reason of confrontation of the Great powers and the aspirations of the neighbouring small countries and Turkey. It passed through our thoughts that one autonomous Macedonia could easier unite with Bulgaria subsequently and if the worst comes to the worst, that it could play a role as a unifying link of a federation of Balkan people. The region of Adrianople, as far as I remember, didn't take part in our program, and I think the idea to add it to autonomous Macedonia came later.|{{ref|Tatarchev}}}}\n\nIn [[Dame Gruev]]'s memoirs, the MRO's goals are stated as follows:\n\n{{quotation|We grouped together and jointly worked out a statute. It was based on the same principles: demand for the implementation of the Berlin Treaty. The statute was worked out after the model of the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation|Bulgarian revolutionary organisation]] before the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|Liberation]]. Our motto was \"Implementation of the resolutions of the Berlin Treaty\". We established a \"Central Committee\" with branches, membership fees, etc. Swearing in for each member was also envisaged. In the regulations, there was nothing concerning the Serbian propaganda but we intended to counteract it by enlightening the people.|{{ref|Gruev}}}}\n[[File:Dame Gruev Portrait.jpeg|thumb|130px|left|[[Dame Gruev]]]]\n\nThe ''Adrianople Region'' was the general name given by the Organization to those areas of [[Thrace]] which, like Macedonia, had been left under Turkish rule i.e. most of it, where the [[Thracian Bulgarians|Bulgarian element]] predominated in the mixed population, too. The organized revolutionary movement in Thrace dates from 1895, when [[Dame Gruev]] recruited [[Hristo Kotsev]], born in [[Shtip]], who was then a teacher in the [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Adrianople]]. Acting in the name of the Central Committee, Kotsev set up a regional committee in [[Adrianople]], and gradually committees were established in a large area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/mm_gd/mm_16.htm |title=Freedom or Death, The Life of Gots\u00e9 Delchev, by Mercia MacDermott, Journeyman Press, London & West Nyack, 1978, p. 230. |publisher=Kroraina.com |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nBased on historical evidences{{ref|gpetrov}}{{ref|yavorov1}}, it is believed by Bulgarian, Western and Russian historians{{ref|Perry}}{{ref|adanir}}{{ref|pandev1}}{{ref|pandev2}}{{ref|pandev3}}<ref>\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0438 \u0432 1894\u20131908 \u0433\u0433., \u0418\u0434\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u044b, \u041b\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0438 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e: \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u0438\u043c. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444. \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\n\u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435: 2008, \u0441\u0442\u0440.7, {{ISBN|978-954-322-317-6}} .</ref> that in 1896 or 1897 this first and probably unofficial name was changed to '''Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees''' ('''BMARC'''); and the organisation existed under this name until 1902, when it was changed to '''Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization''' ('''SMARO''').

In this task, the organisation hoped to enlist the support of the local [[Vlachs]], [[Greeks]] and even [[Turkish people|Turks]]. Efforts were concentrated on moral propaganda and the prospect of rebellion and terrorist actions seemed distant. The organization developed quickly: only in a matter of a few years, the Committee had managed to establish a wide network of local organisations across Macedonia and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]]. These usually centered around the schools of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and had as leaders local or Bulgarian-born teachers.{{ref|Banac1}}\n\nAlthough IMRO was predominantly ethnic Bulgarian since its establishment, it favoured the idea of an autonomous Macedonia and preferred to disassociate itself from official Bulgarian policy and was not under government control. Its founding leaders believed that an autonomous movement was more likely to find favour with the Great Powers than one which was a tool of the Bulgarian government. {{ref|Banac2}} In the words of British contemporary observer [[Henry Brailsford]]:\n\n{{quotation|When, in addition to these advantages, the Bulgarophil Macedonians started their marvellously-organised revolutionary committee in 1893, the Servian cause received its death-blow. By way of emphasising her antagonism to Bulgaria, official Servia now adopted an openly Turcophil policy, and nothing could be more fatal to the prospects of any Christian race in Turkey. The Macedonian peasantry will bestow their allegiance only on a propaganda which promises them some speedy prospect of release from the Ottoman yoke. The Servian movement is a purely official agitation, guided and financed in Belgrade; whereas, despite the sympathy of Sofia, the Bulgarian Revolutionary Committee is a genuine Macedonian organisation.|{{ref|Brailsford}}}}\n\nWhat is more, some of its younger leaders espoused radical socialist and anarchist ideas and saw their goal as the establishment of a new form of government rather than unification with Bulgaria. Eventually, these considerations led the organisation to change its statute and accept as members not only Bulgarians but all Macedonians and Odrinians regardless of ethnicity or creed. In reality, however, besides some Vlach members, its membership remained overwhelmingly Bulgarian Exarchist.{{ref|n4}}<br />\n[[File:IMARO Activists - Bulgarian Comitadjii - Captured by the Ottoman Police.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A convoy of captured [[Bulgaria]]n IMRO activists.]]\n[[File:Arthur D.

Among other documents, they cite as an expression of this understanding the official letter that Dame Gruev and Boris Sarafov, leaders of the headquarters of the Second Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary district during the Ilinden uprising, wrote to the Bulgarian government:\n\n{{quotation|The general staff considers for its duty to pay attention of the honoured Bulgarian government to the catastrophic consequences for Bulgarian nation, in case the government doesn't fulfill its duty toward its homogeneous brothers here in an impressible and energetic way, imposed by the circumstances and the danger, which threaten Bulgarian fatherland today.|{{ref|letter}}}}\n\nIn his [[Macedonism|Macedonistic]] publication ''On Macedonian Matters'' written in the wake of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising]], [[Krste Misirkov]], a highly controversial writer who alternated between pan-Bulgarian and pan-Macedonian nationalism throughout his lifetime, described the IMARO as an organization of Bulgarian officials who work for Bulgarian interests and who are linked in name, and in church and school matters, to the people of Bulgaria, their country and their interests{{ref|Mak}}. Misirkov wrote:\n\n{{quotation|We can call the Uprising whatever we like, but in fact, it was only a partial movement. It was, and still is, an affair of the Exarchists: that is, a Bulgarian ploy to settle the Macedonian question to its own advantage by creating a Bulgarian Macedonia... If the autonomy of Macedonia should result from the present Uprising, the Macedonian question will be settled not to the advantage of the Macedonians but of the Bulgarians, for the Committee, as we have seen earlier, is working behind a Bulgarian front... Thus the reason why the Uprising failed is perfectly clear: from the very outset it was established on the wrong basis instead of being a general Macedonian Uprising it was a partial insurrection with Bulgarian overtones. The only Macedonian Slavs who played a leading part in the Uprising were those who called themselves Bulgarians.|{{ref|Misirkov}}}}\n\n[[Dimitar Vlahov]], another extremely controversial politician and revolutionary, who also alternated between pan-Bulgarian and pan-Macedonian nationalism, member of the left wing of the Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary movement, later Bulgarian deputy in [[Ottoman Parliament]], afterwards one of the main leaders of [[IMRO (United)]] \u2013 de facto extension of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], finally elected in 1946 as ethnic Macedonian vice-president of the [[Praesidium]] of [[Communist Yugoslavia]]'s Parliament, expressed in his book \"''The struggles of Macedonian people for freedom''\", published in Vienna in 1925, his view, confirmed again in Vlahov's ''\"Memoirs\"'', published in Skopje in 1970:\n\n{{quotation|Firstly the revolutionary organization began to work among the Bulgarian population, even not among the whole of it, but only among this part, which participated in the Bulgarian Exarchate. IMRO treated suspiciously to the Bulgarians, which participated in other churches, as the Greek Patriarchate, the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church. As to the revolutionary activity among the other nationalities as Turks, Albanians, Greeks and Vlahs, such question did not exist for the founders of the organization. These other nationalities were for IMRO foreign people... Later, when the leaders of IMARO saw, that the idea for liberation of Macedonia can find followers among the Bulgarians non-Exarchists, as also among the other nationalities in Macedonia, and under the pressure from IMARO-members with left, socialist or anarchist convictions, they changed the statute of IMARO in sense, that member of IMARO can be any Macedonian, regardless of ethnicity or religious denomination.|<ref>[http://www.promacedonia.org/rami/dv/dv_2.html \"\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\". \u0411\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u2116 1, \u0412\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0430, 1925, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 11.]</ref><ref>\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0433\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0432\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0438. \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0442.\u0435. \u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440...\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438, \u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0430 \u0411\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438... \u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432. \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, 1970, \u0441.21.</ref>}}\n\n=== Armed struggle against the Ottomans ===\nThe initial period of idealism for IMARO ended, however, with the [[Vinitsa Affair]] and the discovery by the Ottoman police of a secret depot of ammunition near the [[Bulgaria]]n border in 1897.

The guerilla groups of IMARO, known as \"chetas\" (\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0438) later (after 1903) also waged a war against the pro-Serbian and pro-Greek armed groups during the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia]].\n[[File:Dzole-i-tane-lerinsko.jpg|thumb|250px|IMRO Revolutionaries from [[Florina]], 1903]]\n[[File:Chernopeevs band.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Hristo Chernopeev]]'s band in 1903.]]\nIMARO's leadership of the revolutionary movement was challenged by two other factions: the [[Macedonian Supreme Committee]] in Sofia (''Vurhoven makedono-\u043edrinski komitet'' \u2013 \u0412\u044a\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u043e-\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) and a smaller group of conservatives in [[Salonica]] \u2013 [[Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Brotherhood]] (''Balgarsko Tayno Revolyutsionno Bratstvo'').

The former organisation became known earlier than IMRO, after the 1895 raids into Turkish territory it organised from Bulgaria. Its founders were Macedonian immigrants in Bulgaria as well as Bulgarian army officers. They became known as the \"supremists\" or \"externals\" since they were based outside of Macedonia. The supremists resorted to terrorism against the Ottomans in the hope of provoking a war and thus Bulgarian annexation of Macedonia. For a time in the late 1890s IMARO leaders managed to gain control of the Supreme Committee but it soon split into two factions: one loyal to the IMARO and one led by some officers close to the Bulgarian prince. The second one staged an ill-fated uprising in Eastern Macedonia in 1902, where they were opposed militarily by local IMARO bands led by [[Yane Sandanski]] and [[Hristo Chernopeev]], who were later to become the leaders of the IMARO left wing. {{ref|n6}}\n\nIn Spring 1903, a group by young anarchists connected with IMARO from the ''Gemidzhii Circle'' \u2013 graduates from the Bulgarian secondary school in [[Thessaloniki]] \u2013 launched [[Thessaloniki bombings of 1903|a campaign of terror bombing]] with the aim to attract the attention of the [[Great Powers]] to Ottoman oppression in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Eastern Thrace]].\n\nIn the same time the undisputed leader of the organization, [[Gotse Delchev]], was killed in a skirmish with Turkish forces. Although Delchev had opposed the ideas for an uprising as premature, he finally had no choice but agree to that course of action but at least managed to delay its start from May to August. After his death in 1903 IMARO organised the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]] against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]], which after the initial successes including the forming of the [[Krushevo Republic]], was crushed with much loss of life.\n\n=== After Ilinden ===\n[[File:General Tsontcheff with Macedonian Revolutionists.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ivan Tsonchev|General Tsontcheff]], with revolutionists in 1904.]]\nThe failure of the 1903 insurrection resulted in the eventual split of the IMARO into a left-wing (federalist) faction in the Seres and Strumica districts and a right-wing faction (centralists) in the [[Salonica]], [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]], and [[Uskub]] (present-day Skopje) districts. The left-wing faction opposed Bulgarian nationalism and advocated the creation of a [[Balkan Socialist Federation]] with equality for all subjects and nationalities. The [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]] was disbanded in 1903 but the centralist faction of the IMORO drifted more and more towards Bulgarian nationalism as its regions became increasingly exposed to the incursions of Serb and Greek armed bands, which started infiltrating Macedonia after 1903. The years 1905\u20131907 saw lots of violent fighting between IMORO and Turkish forces as well as between IMORO and Greek and Serb detachments. Meanwhile, the split between the two factions became final when in 1907 Todor Panitza killed the right-wing activists [[Boris Sarafov]] and [[Ivan Garvanov]].{{ref|n5}} The armed Albanian bands of [[\u00c7er\u00e7iz Topulli]] cooperated and were on good terms with armed groups of Bulgarian-Macedonian revolutionaries operating in the [[Lake Prespa]] region and [[Kastoria]] area, a bond formed due to their hostility toward Greeks.<ref name=Skendi211212>{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&ots=zGjQbVyql8&sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Peter%20Germani&f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=211\u2013212|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 both factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. [[Yane Sandanski]] and Hristo Chernopeev contacted the [[Young Turks]] and started legal operation. They tried to set up the ''Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization'' (MARO). Initially, the group developed only propaganda activities. Later, the congress for MARO's official inauguration failed and federalist wing joined mainstream political life as the [[Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section)]]. Some of its leaders like Sandanski and Chernopeev participated in the march on Istanbul to depose the counter-revolutionaries. The former centralists formed the [[Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs]] and like the PFP participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, however, the [[Young Turk]] regime turned increasingly nationalist and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace. This prompted most right-wing and some left-wing IMARO leaders to resume the armed fight in 1909.{{ref|carnegie1}} In January 1910 Hristo Chernopeev and some of his followers founded a [[Bulgarian People's Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]]. In 1911 a new Central Committee of IMARO was formed consisting of [[Todor Alexandrov]], Hristo Chernopeev and [[Petar Chaulev]]. Its aim was to restore unity to the Organisation and direct the new armed struggle against the Turks more efficiently. After Chernopeev was killed in action in 1915 as a Bulgarian officer in World War I, he was replaced by the former supremist leader General [[Alexander Protogerov]].\n[[File:The Balkan boundaries after 1913.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The partition of Macedonia and Adrianople Thrace in 1913]]\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars former IMARO leaders of both the left and the right joined the [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]] and fought with the Bulgarian Army. Others like Sandanski with their bands assisted the Bulgarian army with its advance and still others penetrated as far as the region of [[Kastoria]] southwestern Macedonia.{{ref|Gramos}}  In the Second Balkan War IMORO bands fought the Greeks and Serbs behind the front lines but were subsequently routed and driven out. Notably, [[Petar Chaulev]] was one of the leaders of the [[Ohrid-Debar Uprising]] organised jointly by IMORO and the Albanians of Western Macedonia.\n[[File:Sandanski2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Yane Sandanski|Sandanski]] (left) with IMARO members supporting Bulgarian troops during [[Balkan wars]].]] The [[Tikvesh Uprising]] was another uprising in late June 1913, organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization against the Serbian occupation of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and took place behind the [[Serbia]]n enemy lines during the [[Second Balkan War]].\n\nThe result of the Balkan Wars was that the Macedonian region and Adrianople Thrace was partitioned between Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and the Ottoman Empire (the new state of [[Yugoslavia]] was created as after 1918 and started its existence as Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenians \"SHS\"), with Bulgaria getting the smallest share. In 1913 the whole [[Thracian Bulgarians|Thracian Bulgarian]] population from the Ottoman part of [[Eastern Thrace]] was forcibly expelled to Bulgaria.{{ref|Miletich1}} IMARO, now led by [[Todor Aleksandrov]], maintained its existence in Bulgaria, where it played a role in politics by playing upon Bulgarian irredentism and urging a renewed war to liberate Macedonia. This was one factor in Bulgaria allying itself with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in World War I. During the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|First World War in Macedonia]] (1915\u20131918) the organization supported Bulgarian army and joined to Bulgarian war-time authorities when they took control over [[Vardar Macedonia]] temporarily until the end of war. In this period the autonomism as political tactics was abandoned from all internal IMARO streams and all of them shared annexationist positions, supporting eventual incorporation of Macedonia in Bulgaria.{{ref|bazhdarov}} IMARO organised the Valandovo action of 1915, which was an attack on a large Serbian force. Bulgarian army, supported by the organization's forces, was successful in the first stages of this conflict, managed to drive out the Serbian forces from [[Vardar Macedonia]] and came into positions on the line of the pre-war Greek-Serbian border, which was stabilized as a [[Macedonian front (World War I)|firm front]] until end of 1918. In 1917 IMRO detachments crushed the [[Toplica insurrection]]\nin Eastern Serbia.\n\n== Interwar period ==\n[[File:Todor Alexandrov by G\u00fcnther J\u00f3zsef, 1912.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Todor Aleksandrov]].]]\nThe post-war [[Treaty of Neuilly]] again denied Bulgaria what it felt was its share of Macedonia and Thrace. After this moment the combined Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement separated into two detached organizations: [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (''bulg.'' \u0412\u044a\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f) and '''Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation'''.{{ref|No19Letter}} ITRO was a revolutionary organisation active in the [[Greece|Greek]] regions of [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] to the river [[Struma (river)|Strymon]] and [[Rhodope Mountains]] between 1922 and 1934. The reason for the establishment of ITRO was the transfer of the region from Bulgaria to [[Greece]] in May 1920. ITRO proclaimed its goal as the \"unification of all the disgruntled elements in [[Thrace]] regardless of their nationality\", and to win full political independence for the region. Later IMRO created as a satellite organisation the [[Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation]] (''bulg.'' \u0412\u044a\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f), which operated in the areas of [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Tsaribrod]] and [[Bosilegrad]], ceded to Yugoslavia. IMRO began sending armed bands called ''cheti'' into Greek and Yugoslav Macedonia and Thrace to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the oppressed population. On 23 March 1923 [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]], who favoured a d\u00e9tente with Greece and Yugoslavia, so that Bulgaria could concentrate on its internal problems, signed the [[Treaty of Ni\u0161 (1923)|Treaty of Ni\u0161]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory. However, in the same year IMRO agents assassinated him. IMRO had ''de facto'' full control of [[Pirin Macedonia]] (the Petrich District of the time) and acted as a \"state within a state\", which it used as a base for hit and run attacks against Yugoslavia with the unofficial support of the right-wing Bulgarian government and later [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]].

The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], which saw a chance for using this well developed revolutionary movement to spread revolution in the Balkans and destabilize the Balkan monarchies. Alexandrov defended IMRO's independence and refused to concede on practically all points requested by the Communists. No agreement was reached except for a paper \"Manifesto\" (the so-called [[May Manifesto]] of 6 May 1924), in which the objectives of the unified Macedonian liberation movement were presented: independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a [[Balkan Communist Federation]] and cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]].{{ref|Grishina1}} Failing to secure Alexandrov's cooperation, the [[Comintern]] decided to discredit him and published the contents of the Manifesto on 28 July 1924 in the \"Balkan Federation\" newspaper. VMRO's leaders Todor Aleksandrov and Aleksandar Protogerov promptly denied through the Bulgarian press that they've ever signed any agreements, claiming that the May Manifesto was a communist forgery.{{ref|Grishina2}}\n[[File:Mara Buneva.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Mara Buneva]]]] Shortly after, [[Todor Alexandrov]] was assassinated in unclear circumstances and IMRO came under the leadership of [[Ivan Mihailov]], who became a powerful figure in Bulgarian politics. While IMRO's leadership was quick to ascribe Alexandrov's murder to the communists and even quicker to organise a revenge action against the immediate perpetrators, there is some doubt that Mihailov himself might have been responsible for the murder. Some Bulgarian and Macedonian historians like Zoran Todorovski speculate that it might have been the circle around Mihailov who organised the assassination on inspiration by the Bulgarian government, which was afraid of united IMRO-Communist action against it. However, neither version is corroborated by conclusive historical evidence. The result of the murder was further strife within the organisation and several high-profile murders, including that of Petar Chaulev (who led the [[Ohrid-Debar Uprising]] against the Serbian occupation) in [[Milan]] and ultimately Protogetov himself.{{ref|Grishina3}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ivan Mihailov.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ivan Mihailov]].]] -->\n\nIn this interwar period IMRO led by Aleksandrov and later by Mihailov took actions against the former left-wing assassinating several former members of IMORO's Sandanist wing, who meanwhile had gravitated towards the Bulgarian Communist Party and [[Macedonian Federative Organization]]. [[Gjorche Petrov]] was killed in Sofia in 1922, [[Todor Panitsa]] (who previously killed the right-wing oriented [[Boris Sarafov]] and Ivan Garvanov) was assassinated in Vienna in 1924 by Mihailov's future wife Mencha Karnichiu. [[Dimo Hadjidimov]], Georgi Skrizhovski, Alexander Bujnov, Chudomir Kantardjiev and many others were killed in the events of 1925. <!-- not sure of the exact dates here--> Meanwhile, the left-wing later did form the new organisation based on the principles previously presented in the May Manifesto. The new organization which was an opponent to Mihailov's IMRO was called [[IMRO (United)]] was founded in 1925 in [[Vienna]]. However, it did not have real popular support and remained based abroad with no revolutionary activities in Macedonia. Mihailov's group of young IMRO cadres soon got into conflict with the older guard of the organization. The latter were in favour of the old tactic of incursions by armed bands, whereas the former favoured more flexible tactics with smaller terrorist groups carrying selective assassinations. The conflict grew into a leadership struggle and Mihailov soon, in turn, ordered the assassination in 1928 of a rival leader, General Aleksandar Protogerov, which sparked a fratricidal war between \"Mihailovists\" and \"Protogerovists\". The less numerous Protogerovists soon became allied with Yugoslavia and certain Bulgarian military circles with fascist leanings and who favoured rapprochement with Yugoslavia. The policy of assassinations was effective in making Serbian rule in Vardar Macedonia feel insecure but in turn provoked brutal reprisals on the local peasant population. Having lost a lot of popular support in Vardar Macedonia due to his policies, Mihailov favoured the \"internationalization\" of the Macedonian question.\n\n[[File:Chernozemski.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Vlado Chernozemski]].]]\n\nHe established close links with the Croatian [[Ustashi]] and Italy. Numerous assassinations were carried out by IMRO agents in many countries, the majority in Yugoslavia. The most spectacular of these was the assassination of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] and the French Foreign Minister [[Louis Barthou]] in [[Marseille]] in 1934 in collaboration with the [[Croatia]]n [[Ustashi]]. The killing was carried out by the VMRO assassin [[Vlado Chernozemski]] and happened after the suppression of IMRO following the 19 May 1934 military coup in Bulgaria. IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. In 1934 Mihailov was forced to escape to [[Turkey]]. He ordered to his supporters not to resist to the Bulgarian army and to accept the disarmament peacefully, thus avoiding fratricides, destabilization of Bulgaria, civil war or external invasion.{{ref|MNI3}} Many inhabitants of Pirin Macedonia met this disbandment with satisfaction because it was perceived as relief from an unlawful and quite often brutal parallel authority. IMRO kept its organization alive in exile in various countries but ceased to be an active force in Macedonian politics except for brief moments during World War II. Meanwhile, a [[Resolution of the Comintern on the Macedonian Question|resolution of the Comintern]] for recognition of a distinct [[ethnic Macedonian]] ethnicity, which was accepted also by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United), was published in January 1934. IMRO (United) remained active until 1936 when it was absorbed into the [[Balkan Communist Federation]].{{ref|Banac3}}\n\nIMRO used at that time, what the American journalist [[H. R.

It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the Florina, Kastoria and Edessa districts.\n\nOn 2 August 1944 (in what in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] is referred to as the Second [[Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden]]) in the St. [[Prohor P\u010dinjski Monastery|Prohor P\u010dinjski]] monastery at the [[ASNOM|Antifascist assembly of the national liberation of Macedonia]] (ASNOM) with [[Panko Brashnarov]] (the former IMRO revolutionary from the Ilinden period and the IMRO United) as a first speaker, the modern [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian state]] was officially proclaimed, as a federal state within Tito's Yugoslavia, receiving recognition from the Allies. After the declaration of war by Bulgaria on Germany, in September 1944 Mihailov arrived in German-occupied [[Skopje]], where the Germans hoped that he could form a pro-German [[Independent State of Macedonia]] with their support. Seeing that the war is lost to Germany and to avoid further bloodshed, he refused. Mihailov eventually ended up in Rome where he published numerous articles, books and pamphlets on the [[Macedonian Question]].{{ref|PK1}}\n\n== Post-war period ==\n[[File:Kiril Gligorov IMRO killed by serbs.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The execution of the revolutionist [[Kiril Gligorov]] by the Yugoslav authorities in 1925.]]\n\nMembers of the IMRO (United) participated in the forming of Republic of Macedonia a federal state of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and some of the leading members entered the government: [[Dimitar Vlahov]], [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Pavel Shatev]] (the latter was the last surviving member of \"Gemidzhii\" or \"Varkarides\" in Greek, the group that executed the [[Thessaloniki bombings of 1903]]). However, they were quickly ousted by cadres loyal to the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade, who had had pro-Serbian leanings before the war. {{ref|PK2}} According to Macedonian historian [[Ivan Katard\u017eiev|Ivan Katardjiev]] such Macedonian activists came from IMRO (United) and the Bulgarian Communist Party never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias and on many issues opposed the Serbian-educated leaders, who held most of the political power. [[Pavel Shatev]] went as far as to send a petition to the Bulgarian legation in Belgrade protesting the anti-Bulgarian policies of the Yugoslav leadership and the Serbianisation of the Bulgarian language.{{ref|Katardjiev}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Presidium PRMacedonia.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Presidium of the Assembly of  [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] with participation of the communists [[Dimitar Vlahov]] and [[Panko Brashnarov]] - former members of IMRO, later IMRO (United).]] -->\n\nFrom the start, the Yugoslav authorities organised frequent purges and trials of Macedonian communists and non-party people charged with autonomist deviation. Many of the left-wing IMRO government officials, including [[Pavel Shatev]] and [[Panko Brashnarov]], were purged from their positions too, then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed by the Yugoslav federal authorities on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including: pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, collaboration with the [[Cominform]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy, etc. One of the victims of these campaigns was [[Metodija Andonov Cento]], a wartime partisan leader and president of [[ASNOM]], who was convicted of having worked for a \"completely independent Macedonia\" as an IMRO member. A survivor among the communists associated with the idea of Macedonian autonomy was [[Dimitar Vlahov]], who was used \"solely for window dressing\".{{ref|PK3}}\n\nOn the other hand, former Mihailovists were also persecuted by the Belgrade-controlled authorities on accusations of collaboration with the Bulgarian occupation, Bulgarian nationalism, anti-communist and anti-Yugoslav activities, etc. Notable victims included [[Spiro Kitinchev]], mayor of Skopje, Ilija Kocarev, mayor of Ohrid and Georgi Karev, the mayor of Krushevo during the Bulgarian occupation and brother of Ilinden revolutionary Nikola Karev.{{ref|Brown}} Another IMRO activist, Sterio Guli, son of Pitu Guli, reportedly shot himself upon the arrival of Tito's partisans in Krushevo in despair over what he saw as a second period of Serbian dominance in Macedonia. Also, Shatorov's supporters in Vardar Macedonia, called Sharlisti, were systematically exterminated by the YCP in the autumn of 1944, and repressed for their anti-Yugoslav and pro-Bulgarian political positions.\n\nIMRO's supporters in Bulgarian [[Pirin Macedonia]] fared no better. With the help of some former Protogerovists, their main activists were hunted by the Communist police and many of them killed or imprisoned. Because some IMRO supporters openly opposed the then official policy of Communist Bulgaria to promote Macedonian ethnic consciousness in Pirin Macedonia they were repressed or exiled to the interior of Bulgaria. Many from this persecuted people emigrated through Greece and Turkey to Western countries. At this period the American and Greek intelligence services recruited some of them, trained them and later used this so-called ''\"[[Goryani]]\"'' as spies and saboteurs, smuggling them back to Communist Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFQc1kYqrQcC&pg=PA375&dq=bulgarians+IMRO&lr=&as_brr=3&hl=bg |title=Rebel with a just cause: a political journey against the winds of the 20th century, Spas Ra\u012dkin, Pensoft Publishers, 2001, p. 375 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=14 November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-954-642-130-2}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that Yugoslav Macedonian historical scholarship reluctantly acknowledged the Bulgarian ethnic self-identification of the Ilinden IMRO leaders, they were adopted in the national pantheon of Yugoslav Macedonia as ethnic Macedonians.

The 1903 Ilinden Uprising was presented as a direct precursor of the 1944 events, which were termed a \"Second Ilinden\", in an effort to prove the continuity of the struggle for independence of the Macedonian nation. Consequently, it became necessary for the socialist authorities to show that 19th century IMRO figures, particularly Delchev and Sandanski, had been consciously Macedonian in identity. Delchev and Sandanski were adopted as symbols of the republic, had numerous monuments built in their honor, and they were often the topic of articles in the academic journal ''[[Macedonian Review]]'', as was the Ilinden Uprising. In contrast, Todor Aleksandrov was labeled a Bulgarian bourgeois chauvinist. The claim to a Macedonian identity of Sandanski was used to bolster [[Skopje]]'s claim to the [[Blagoevgrad Province|Pirin region]].<ref name=\"LampeMazower2004cw\"/>\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] the situation was more complex, because the IMRO was associated with the 1923\u201334 anti-communist regime. Before 1960, although the subject was not taboo, few articles on the topic appeared in Bulgarian academic venues, and the IMRO figures were given mostly regional recognition in the Pirin region. After 1960, orders from the highest level were to reincorporate the Macedonian revolutionary movement in the Bulgarian history, and to prove the Bulgarian credentials of their historical leaders. This trend reached its peak in 1981 (the 1300 year anniversary of Bulgarian state), when Delchev and Sandanski were openly made historical symbols of the Bulgarian state in a proclamation of [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]. There were also attempts to rehabilitate Todor Aleksandrov because of his Bulgarian nationalism, but these remained controversial due to his role in suppressing the left wing, a role for which he had been declared a fascist.<ref name=\"LampeMazower2004cw\"/>\n\n== After the fall of communism ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}\nWith both Bulgaria and Yugoslavia under Communist rule, there was no scope for IMRO's revival.\n\n=== Republic of Macedonia ===\n[[File:Flag of the IMRO.svg|left|thumb|200px|Historical flag of IMRO.<ref>The statute of VMRO-BND, 2008 (in Bulgarian) Art. 3.

Many exiles returned to Macedonia from abroad, and a new generation of young Macedonian intellectuals rediscovered the history of Macedonian nationalism. In these circumstances, it was not surprising that the IMRO name was revived. A new IMRO was founded on 17 June 1990 in [[Skopje]]. Although IMRO claims a line descent from the old IMRO, there is no real connection between the old IMRO and the new one. The party is called the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]] (In {{lang-mk|Vnatre\u0161no-Makedonska Revolucionerna Organizacija-Demokratska Partija za Makedonsko Nacionalno Edinstvo}}, or VMRO-DPMNE) describes itself as a [[Christian Democratic]] party which supports the admission of Macedonia to [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].\n\nA minor political party carrying the name IMRO is the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization\u2013People's Party]] (VMRO-NP). Although a separate structure since the split in 2004, the political line of VMRO-NP is reminiscent of VMRO-DPMNE's and its members maintain close ties with the latter's party structure.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[File:Vmro-bg-logo.png|right|thumb|150px|VMRO-BND logo.]]\nA distinct IMRO organization was also revived in Bulgaria after 1989 first under the name VMRO-SMD (\u0412\u041c\u0420\u041e-\u0421\u041c\u0414 \u2013 \u0421\u044a\u044e\u0437 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) and then simply VMRO (\u0412\u041c\u0420\u041e) as a cultural organisation.

Most of them (with the exception of Ivan Hadzhinikolov) were closely connected with the [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki]]. According to Hristo Tatarchev's \"Memoirs\", IMRO was first called simply the '''Macedonian Revolutionary Organization''' ('''MRO'''). Ivan Hadzhinikolov in his memoirs lists the five basic principles of the MRO's foundation:\n\n{{quotation|\n# The revolutionary organization should be established within Macedonia and should act there so that the Greeks and Serbs couldn't label it as a tool of the Bulgarian government.\n# Its founders should be locals and living in Macedonia.\n# The political motto of the organization should be the autonomy of Macedonia.\n# The organization should be secret and independent, without any links with the governments of the liberated neighbor states, and\n# From the Macedonian immigrants in Bulgaria and the Bulgarian society, only moral and material help for the struggle of the Macedonian revolutionaries should be required.|{{ref|Hadzhinikolov}}}}\n[[File:Hristo Tatar\u010dev.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Hristo Tatarchev]].]]\n\nAccording to Dr. [[Hristo Tatarchev]]:\n\n{{quotation|We talked a long time about the goal of this organization and at last we fixed it on autonomy of Macedonia with the priority of the Bulgarian element. We couldn't accept the position for \"direct joining to Bulgaria\" because we saw that it would meet big difficulties by reason of confrontation of the Great powers and the aspirations of the neighbouring small countries and Turkey. It passed through our thoughts that one autonomous Macedonia could easier unite with Bulgaria subsequently and if the worst comes to the worst, that it could play a role as a unifying link of a federation of Balkan people. The region of Adrianople, as far as I remember, didn't take part in our program, and I think the idea to add it to the autonomous Macedonia came later.|{{ref|Tatarchev}}}}\n\nIn [[Dame Gruev]]'s memoirs, the MRO's goals are stated as follows:\n\n{{quotation|We grouped together and jointly worked out a statute. It was based on the same principles: demand for the implementation of the Berlin Treaty. The statute was worked out after the model of the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation|Bulgarian revolutionary organisation]] before the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|Liberation]]. Our motto was \"Implementation of the resolutions of the Berlin Treaty\". We established a \"Central Committee\" with branches, membership fees, etc. Swearing in for each member was also envisaged. In the regulations, there was nothing concerning the Serbian propaganda but we intended to counteract it by enlightening the people.|{{ref|Gruev}}}}\n[[File:Dame Gruev Portrait.jpeg|thumb|130px|left|[[Dame Gruev]]]]\n\nThe ''Adrianople Region'' was the general name given by the Organization to those areas of [[Thrace]] which, like Macedonia, had been left under Turkish rule i.e. most of it, where the [[Thracian Bulgarians|Bulgarian element]] predominated in the mixed population, too. The organized revolutionary movement in Thrace dates from 1895, when [[Dame Gruev]] recruited [[Hristo Kotsev]], born in [[Shtip]], who was then a teacher in the [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Adrianople]]. Acting in the name of the Central Committee, Kotsev set up a regional committee in [[Adrianople]], and gradually committees were established in a large area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/mm_gd/mm_16.htm |title=Freedom or Death, The Life of Gots\u00e9 Delchev, by Mercia MacDermott, Journeyman Press, London & West Nyack, 1978, p. 230. |publisher=Kroraina.com |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nBased on historical evidences{{ref|gpetrov}}{{ref|yavorov1}}, it is believed by Bulgarian, Western and Russian historians{{ref|Perry}}{{ref|adanir}}{{ref|pandev1}}{{ref|pandev2}}{{ref|pandev3}}<ref>\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0438 \u0432 1894\u20131908 \u0433\u0433., \u0418\u0434\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u044b, \u041b\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0438 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e: \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u0438\u043c. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444. \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\n\u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435: 2008, \u0441\u0442\u0440.7, {{ISBN|978-954-322-317-6}} .</ref> that in 1896 or 1897 this first and probably unofficial name was changed to '''Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees''' ('''BMARC'''); and the organisation existed under this name until 1902, when it was changed to '''Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization''' ('''SMARO''').

In this task, the organisation hoped to enlist the support of the local [[Vlachs]], [[Greeks]] and even [[Turkish people|Turks]]. Efforts were concentrated on moral propaganda and the prospect of rebellion and terrorist actions seemed distant. The organization developed quickly: only in a matter of a few years, the Committee had managed to establish a wide network of local organisations across Macedonia and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]]. These usually centered around the schools of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and had as leaders local or Bulgarian-born teachers.{{ref|Banac1}}\n\nAlthough IMRO was predominantly ethnic Bulgarian since its establishment, it favoured the idea of an autonomous Macedonia and preferred to disassociate itself from official Bulgarian policy and was not under government control. Its founding leaders believed that an autonomous movement was more likely to find favour with the Great Powers than one which was a tool of the Bulgarian government. {{ref|Banac2}} In the words of British contemporary observer [[Henry Brailsford]]:\n\n{{quotation|When, in addition to these advantages, the Bulgarophil Macedonians started their marvellously-organised revolutionary committee in 1893, the Servian cause received its death-blow. By way of emphasising her antagonism to Bulgaria, official Servia now adopted an openly Turcophil policy, and nothing could be more fatal to the prospects of any Christian race in Turkey. The Macedonian peasantry will bestow their allegiance only on a propaganda which promises them some speedy prospect of release from the Ottoman yoke. The Servian movement is a purely official agitation, guided and financed in Belgrade; whereas, despite the sympathy of Sofia, the Bulgarian Revolutionary Committee is a genuine Macedonian organisation.|{{ref|Brailsford}}}}\n\nWhat is more, some of its younger leaders espoused radical socialist and anarchist ideas and saw their goal as the establishment of a new form of government rather than unification with Bulgaria. Eventually, these considerations led the organisation to change its statute and accept as members not only Bulgarians but all Macedonians and Odrinians regardless of ethnicity or creed. In reality, however, besides some Vlach members, its membership remained overwhelmingly Bulgarian Exarchist.{{ref|n4}}<br />\n[[File:IMARO Activists - Bulgarian Comitadjii - Captured by the Ottoman Police.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A convoy of captured [[Bulgaria]]n IMRO activists.]]\n[[File:Arthur D.

Among other documents, they cite as an expression of this understanding the official letter that Dame Gruev and Boris Sarafov, leaders of the headquarters of the Second Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary district during the Ilinden uprising, wrote to the Bulgarian government:\n\n{{quotation|The general staff considers for its duty to pay attention of the honoured Bulgarian government to the catastrophic consequences for Bulgarian nation, in case the government doesn't fulfill its duty toward its homogeneous brothers here in an impressible and energetic way, imposed by the circumstances and the danger, which threaten Bulgarian fatherland today.|{{ref|letter}}}}\n\nIn his [[Macedonism|Macedonistic]] publication ''On Macedonian Matters'' written in the wake of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising]], [[Krste Misirkov]], a highly controversial writer who alternated between pan-Bulgarian and pan-Macedonian nationalism throughout his lifetime, described the IMARO as an organization of Bulgarian officials who work for Bulgarian interests and who are linked in name, and in church and school matters, to the people of Bulgaria, their country and their interests{{ref|Mak}}. Misirkov wrote:\n\n{{quotation|We can call the Uprising whatever we like, but in fact, it was only a partial movement. It was, and still is, an affair of the Exarchists: that is, a Bulgarian ploy to settle the Macedonian question to its own advantage by creating a Bulgarian Macedonia... If the autonomy of Macedonia should result from the present Uprising, the Macedonian question will be settled not to the advantage of the Macedonians but of the Bulgarians, for the Committee, as we have seen earlier, is working behind a Bulgarian front... Thus the reason why the Uprising failed is perfectly clear: from the very outset it was established on the wrong basis instead of being a general Macedonian Uprising it was a partial insurrection with Bulgarian overtones.

As to the revolutionary activity among the other nationalities as Turks, Albanians, Greeks and Vlahs, such question did not exist for the founders of the organization.

Its founders were Macedonian immigrants in Bulgaria as well as Bulgarian army officers. They became known as the \"supremists\" or \"externals\" since they were based outside of Macedonia. The supremists resorted to terrorism against the Ottomans in the hope of provoking a war and thus Bulgarian annexation of Macedonia. For a time in the late 1890s IMARO leaders managed to gain control of the Supreme Committee but it soon split into two factions: one loyal to the IMARO and one led by some officers close to the Bulgarian prince. The second one staged an ill-fated uprising in Eastern Macedonia in 1902, where they were opposed militarily by local IMARO bands led by [[Yane Sandanski]] and [[Hristo Chernopeev]], who were later to become the leaders of the IMARO left wing. {{ref|n6}}\n\nIn Spring 1903, a group by young anarchists connected with IMARO from the ''Gemidzhii Circle'' \u2013 graduates from the Bulgarian secondary school in [[Thessaloniki]] \u2013 launched [[Thessaloniki bombings of 1903|a campaign of terror bombing]] with the aim to attract the attention of the [[Great Powers]] to Ottoman oppression in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Eastern Thrace]].\n\nIn the same time the undisputed leader of the organization, [[Gotse Delchev]], was killed in a skirmish with Turkish forces. Although Delchev had opposed the ideas for an uprising as premature, he finally had no choice but agree to that course of action but at least managed to delay its start from May to August. After his death in 1903 IMARO organised the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]] against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]], which after the initial successes including the forming of the [[Krushevo Republic]], was crushed with much loss of life.\n\n=== After Ilinden ===\n[[File:General Tsontcheff with Macedonian Revolutionists.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ivan Tsonchev|General Tsontcheff]], with revolutionists in 1904.]]\nThe failure of the 1903 insurrection resulted in the eventual split of the IMARO into a left-wing (federalist) faction in the Seres and Strumica districts and a right-wing faction (centralists) in the [[Salonica]], [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]], and [[Uskub]] (present-day Skopje) districts. The left-wing faction opposed Bulgarian nationalism and advocated the creation of a [[Balkan Socialist Federation]] with equality for all subjects and nationalities. The [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]] was disbanded in 1903 but the centralist faction of the IMORO drifted more and more towards Bulgarian nationalism as its regions became increasingly exposed to the incursions of Serb and Greek armed bands, which started infiltrating Macedonia after 1903. The years 1905\u20131907 saw lots of violent fighting between IMORO and Turkish forces as well as between IMORO and Greek and Serb detachments. Meanwhile, the split between the two factions became final when in 1907 Todor Panitza killed the right-wing activists [[Boris Sarafov]] and [[Ivan Garvanov]].{{ref|n5}} The armed Albanian bands of [[\u00c7er\u00e7iz Topulli]] cooperated and were on good terms with armed groups of Bulgarian-Macedonian revolutionaries operating in the [[Lake Prespa]] region and [[Kastoria]] area, a bond formed due to their hostility toward Greeks.<ref name=Skendi211212>{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&ots=zGjQbVyql8&sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Peter%20Germani&f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=211\u2013212|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 both factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. [[Yane Sandanski]] and Hristo Chernopeev contacted the [[Young Turks]] and started legal operation. They tried to set up the ''Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization'' (MARO). Initially, the group developed only propaganda activities. Later, the congress for MARO's official inauguration failed and federalist wing joined mainstream political life as the [[Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section)]]. Some of its leaders like Sandanski and Chernopeev participated in the march on Istanbul to depose the counter-revolutionaries. The former centralists formed the [[Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs]] and like the PFP participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, however, the [[Young Turk]] regime turned increasingly nationalist and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace. This prompted most right-wing and some left-wing IMARO leaders to resume the armed fight in 1909.{{ref|carnegie1}} In January 1910 Hristo Chernopeev and some of his followers founded a [[Bulgarian People's Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]]. In 1911 a new Central Committee of IMARO was formed consisting of [[Todor Alexandrov]], Hristo Chernopeev and [[Petar Chaulev]]. Its aim was to restore unity to the Organisation and direct the new armed struggle against the Turks more efficiently. After Chernopeev was killed in action in 1915 as a Bulgarian officer in World War I, he was replaced by the former supremist leader General [[Alexander Protogerov]].\n[[File:The Balkan boundaries after 1913.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The partition of Macedonia and Adrianople Thrace in 1913]]\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars former IMARO leaders of both the left and the right joined the [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]] and fought with the Bulgarian Army. Others like Sandanski with their bands assisted the Bulgarian army with its advance and still others penetrated as far as the region of [[Kastoria]] southwestern Macedonia.{{ref|Gramos}}  In the Second Balkan War IMORO bands fought the Greeks and Serbs behind the front lines but were subsequently routed and driven out. Notably, [[Petar Chaulev]] was one of the leaders of the [[Ohrid-Debar Uprising]] organised jointly by IMORO and the Albanians of Western Macedonia.\n[[File:Sandanski2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Yane Sandanski|Sandanski]] (left) with IMARO members supporting Bulgarian troops during [[Balkan wars]].]] The [[Tikvesh Uprising]] was another uprising in late June 1913, organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization against the Serbian occupation of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and took place behind the [[Serbia]]n enemy lines during the [[Second Balkan War]].\n\nThe result of the Balkan Wars was that the Macedonian region and Adrianople Thrace was partitioned between Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and the Ottoman Empire (the new state of [[Yugoslavia]] was created as after 1918 and started its existence as Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenians \"SHS\"), with Bulgaria getting the smallest share. In 1913 the whole [[Thracian Bulgarians|Thracian Bulgarian]] population from the Ottoman part of [[Eastern Thrace]] was forcibly expelled to Bulgaria.{{ref|Miletich1}} IMARO, now led by [[Todor Aleksandrov]], maintained its existence in Bulgaria, where it played a role in politics by playing upon Bulgarian irredentism and urging a renewed war to liberate Macedonia. This was one factor in Bulgaria allying itself with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in World War I. During the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|First World War in Macedonia]] (1915\u20131918) the organization supported Bulgarian army and joined to Bulgarian war-time authorities when they took control over [[Vardar Macedonia]] temporarily until the end of war. In this period the autonomism as political tactics was abandoned from all internal IMARO streams and all of them shared annexationist positions, supporting eventual incorporation of Macedonia in Bulgaria.{{ref|bazhdarov}} IMARO organised the Valandovo action of 1915, which was an attack on a large Serbian force. Bulgarian army, supported by the organization's forces, was successful in the first stages of this conflict, managed to drive out the Serbian forces from [[Vardar Macedonia]] and came into positions on the line of the pre-war Greek-Serbian border, which was stabilized as a [[Macedonian front (World War I)|firm front]] until end of 1918.

After this moment the combined Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement separated into two detached organizations: [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (''bulg.'' \u0412\u044a\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f) and '''Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation'''.{{ref|No19Letter}} ITRO was a revolutionary organisation active in the [[Greece|Greek]] regions of [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] to the river [[Struma (river)|Strymon]] and [[Rhodope Mountains]] between 1922 and 1934. The reason for the establishment of ITRO was the transfer of the region from Bulgaria to [[Greece]] in May 1920. ITRO proclaimed its goal as the \"unification of all the disgruntled elements in [[Thrace]] regardless of their nationality\", and to win full political independence for the region. Later IMRO created as a satellite organisation the [[Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation]] (''bulg.'' \u0412\u044a\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f), which operated in the areas of [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Tsaribrod]] and [[Bosilegrad]], ceded to Yugoslavia. IMRO began sending armed bands called ''cheti'' into Greek and Yugoslav Macedonia and Thrace to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the oppressed population. On 23 March 1923 [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]], who favoured a d\u00e9tente with Greece and Yugoslavia, so that Bulgaria could concentrate on its internal problems, signed the [[Treaty of Ni\u0161 (1923)|Treaty of Ni\u0161]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory. However, in the same year IMRO agents assassinated him. IMRO had ''de facto'' full control of [[Pirin Macedonia]] (the Petrich District of the time) and acted as a \"state within a state\", which it used as a base for hit and run attacks against Yugoslavia with the unofficial support of the right-wing Bulgarian government and later [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]].

The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], which saw a chance for using this well developed revolutionary movement to spread revolution in the Balkans and destabilize the Balkan monarchies. Alexandrov defended IMRO's independence and refused to concede on practically all points requested by the Communists. No agreement was reached except for a paper \"Manifesto\" (the so-called [[May Manifesto]] of 6 May 1924), in which the objectives of the unified Macedonian liberation movement were presented: independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a [[Balkan Communist Federation]] and cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]].{{ref|Grishina1}} Failing to secure Alexandrov's cooperation, the [[Comintern]] decided to discredit him and published the contents of the Manifesto on 28 July 1924 in the \"Balkan Federation\" newspaper. VMRO's leaders Todor Aleksandrov and Aleksandar Protogerov promptly denied through the Bulgarian press that they've ever signed any agreements, claiming that the May Manifesto was a communist forgery.{{ref|Grishina2}}\n[[File:Mara Buneva.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Mara Buneva]]]] Shortly after, [[Todor Alexandrov]] was assassinated in unclear circumstances and IMRO came under the leadership of [[Ivan Mihailov]], who became a powerful figure in Bulgarian politics. While IMRO's leadership was quick to ascribe Alexandrov's murder to the communists and even quicker to organise a revenge action against the immediate perpetrators, there is some doubt that Mihailov himself might have been responsible for the murder. Some Bulgarian and Macedonian historians like Zoran Todorovski speculate that it might have been the circle around Mihailov who organised the assassination on inspiration by the Bulgarian government, which was afraid of united IMRO-Communist action against it. However, neither version is corroborated by conclusive historical evidence. The result of the murder was further strife within the organisation and several high-profile murders, including that of Petar Chaulev (who led the [[Ohrid-Debar Uprising]] against the Serbian occupation) in [[Milan]] and ultimately Protogetov himself.{{ref|Grishina3}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ivan Mihailov.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ivan Mihailov]].]] -->\n\nIn this interwar period IMRO led by Aleksandrov and later by Mihailov took actions against the former left-wing assassinating several former members of IMORO's Sandanist wing, who meanwhile had gravitated towards the Bulgarian Communist Party and [[Macedonian Federative Organization]]. [[Gjorche Petrov]] was killed in Sofia in 1922, [[Todor Panitsa]] (who previously killed the right-wing oriented [[Boris Sarafov]] and Ivan Garvanov) was assassinated in Vienna in 1924 by Mihailov's future wife Mencha Karnichiu. [[Dimo Hadjidimov]], Georgi Skrizhovski, Alexander Bujnov, Chudomir Kantardjiev and many others were killed in the events of 1925. <!-- not sure of the exact dates here--> Meanwhile, the left-wing later did form the new organisation based on the principles previously presented in the May Manifesto. The new organization which was an opponent to Mihailov's IMRO was called [[IMRO (United)]] was founded in 1925 in [[Vienna]]. However, it did not have real popular support and remained based abroad with no revolutionary activities in Macedonia. Mihailov's group of young IMRO cadres soon got into conflict with the older guard of the organization. The latter were in favour of the old tactic of incursions by armed bands, whereas the former favoured more flexible tactics with smaller terrorist groups carrying selective assassinations. The conflict grew into a leadership struggle and Mihailov soon, in turn, ordered the assassination in 1928 of a rival leader, General Aleksandar Protogerov, which sparked a fratricidal war between \"Mihailovists\" and \"Protogerovists\". The less numerous Protogerovists soon became allied with Yugoslavia and certain Bulgarian military circles with fascist leanings and who favoured rapprochement with Yugoslavia. The policy of assassinations was effective in making Serbian rule in Vardar Macedonia feel insecure but in turn provoked brutal reprisals on the local peasant population. Having lost a lot of popular support in Vardar Macedonia due to his policies, Mihailov favoured the \"internationalization\" of the Macedonian question.\n\n[[File:Chernozemski.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Vlado Chernozemski]].]]\n\nHe established close links with the Croatian [[Ustashi]] and Italy. Numerous assassinations were carried out by IMRO agents in many countries, the majority in Yugoslavia. The most spectacular of these was the assassination of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] and the French Foreign Minister [[Louis Barthou]] in [[Marseille]] in 1934 in collaboration with the [[Croatia]]n [[Ustashi]]. The killing was carried out by the VMRO assassin [[Vlado Chernozemski]] and happened after the suppression of IMRO following the 19 May 1934 military coup in Bulgaria. IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. In 1934 Mihailov was forced to escape to [[Turkey]]. He ordered to his supporters not to resist to the Bulgarian army and to accept the disarmament peacefully, thus avoiding fratricides, destabilization of Bulgaria, civil war or external invasion.{{ref|MNI3}} Many inhabitants of Pirin Macedonia met this disbandment with satisfaction because it was perceived as relief from an unlawful and quite often brutal parallel authority. IMRO kept its organization alive in exile in various countries but ceased to be an active force in Macedonian politics except for brief moments during World War II. Meanwhile, a [[Resolution of the Comintern on the Macedonian Question|resolution of the Comintern]] for recognition of a distinct [[ethnic Macedonian]] ethnicity, which was accepted also by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United), was published in January 1934. IMRO (United) remained active until 1936 when it was absorbed into the [[Balkan Communist Federation]].{{ref|Banac3}}\n\nIMRO used at that time, what the American journalist [[H. R.

Some former [[IMRO (United)]] members, such as [[Metodi Shatorov]], who was the regional leader of the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]], also refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers,{{ref|PK0}} contrary to instructions from [[Belgrade]] and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organisations within the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. This policy changed towards 1943 with the arrival of the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]] [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], who began in earnest to organise armed resistance to the Bulgarian occupation. Many former IMRO members assisted the authorities in fighting Tempo's partizans.\n\nIn Greece the Bulgarian troops, following on the heels of the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of the country]], occupied the whole of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace|Eastern Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]]. In eastern and central Macedonia, some of the local [[Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavic-speaking minority]] greeted the Bulgarian troops as liberators, and efforts were undertaken by the Bulgarian authorities to \"instill in them a Bulgarian national identity\".<ref>Loring M.

With the help of Mihailov and Macedonian emigres in Sofia, several pro-Bulgarian armed detachments \"[[Ohrana]]\" were organised in the [[Kastoria]], [[Florina]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] districts. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia \u2013 [[Andon Kalchev]] and [[Georgi Dimchev]].{{ref|15}} It was apparent that Mihailov had broader plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under a German control. It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the Florina, Kastoria and Edessa districts.\n\nOn 2 August 1944 (in what in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] is referred to as the Second [[Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden]]) in the St. [[Prohor P\u010dinjski Monastery|Prohor P\u010dinjski]] monastery at the [[ASNOM|Antifascist assembly of the national liberation of Macedonia]] (ASNOM) with [[Panko Brashnarov]] (the former IMRO revolutionary from the Ilinden period and the IMRO United) as a first speaker, the modern [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian state]] was officially proclaimed, as a federal state within Tito's Yugoslavia, receiving recognition from the Allies. After the declaration of war by Bulgaria on Germany, in September 1944 Mihailov arrived in German-occupied [[Skopje]], where the Germans hoped that he could form a pro-German [[Independent State of Macedonia]] with their support. Seeing that the war is lost to Germany and to avoid further bloodshed, he refused. Mihailov eventually ended up in Rome where he published numerous articles, books and pamphlets on the [[Macedonian Question]].{{ref|PK1}}\n\n== Post-war period ==\n[[File:Kiril Gligorov IMRO killed by serbs.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The execution of the revolutionist [[Kiril Gligorov]] by the Yugoslav authorities in 1925.]]\n\nMembers of the IMRO (United) participated in the forming of Republic of Macedonia a federal state of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and some of the leading members entered the government: [[Dimitar Vlahov]], [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Pavel Shatev]] (the latter was the last surviving member of \"Gemidzhii\" or \"Varkarides\" in Greek, the group that executed the [[Thessaloniki bombings of 1903]]). However, they were quickly ousted by cadres loyal to the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade, who had had pro-Serbian leanings before the war. {{ref|PK2}} According to Macedonian historian [[Ivan Katard\u017eiev|Ivan Katardjiev]] such Macedonian activists came from IMRO (United) and the Bulgarian Communist Party never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias and on many issues opposed the Serbian-educated leaders, who held most of the political power.

Many of the left-wing IMRO government officials, including [[Pavel Shatev]] and [[Panko Brashnarov]], were purged from their positions too, then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed by the Yugoslav federal authorities on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including: pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, collaboration with the [[Cominform]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy, etc. One of the victims of these campaigns was [[Metodija Andonov Cento]], a wartime partisan leader and president of [[ASNOM]], who was convicted of having worked for a \"completely independent Macedonia\" as an IMRO member. A survivor among the communists associated with the idea of Macedonian autonomy was [[Dimitar Vlahov]], who was used \"solely for window dressing\".{{ref|PK3}}\n\nOn the other hand, former Mihailovists were also persecuted by the Belgrade-controlled authorities on accusations of collaboration with the Bulgarian occupation, Bulgarian nationalism, anti-communist and anti-Yugoslav activities, etc. Notable victims included [[Spiro Kitinchev]], mayor of Skopje, Ilija Kocarev, mayor of Ohrid and Georgi Karev, the mayor of Krushevo during the Bulgarian occupation and brother of Ilinden revolutionary Nikola Karev.{{ref|Brown}} Another IMRO activist, Sterio Guli, son of Pitu Guli, reportedly shot himself upon the arrival of Tito's partisans in Krushevo in despair over what he saw as a second period of Serbian dominance in Macedonia. Also, Shatorov's supporters in Vardar Macedonia, called Sharlisti, were systematically exterminated by the YCP in the autumn of 1944, and repressed for their anti-Yugoslav and pro-Bulgarian political positions.\n\nIMRO's supporters in Bulgarian [[Pirin Macedonia]] fared no better. With the help of some former Protogerovists, their main activists were hunted by the Communist police and many of them killed or imprisoned. Because some IMRO supporters openly opposed the then official policy of Communist Bulgaria to promote Macedonian ethnic consciousness in Pirin Macedonia they were repressed or exiled to the interior of Bulgaria. Many from this persecuted people emigrated through Greece and Turkey to Western countries. At this period the American and Greek intelligence services recruited some of them, trained them and later used this so-called ''\"[[Goryani]]\"'' as spies and saboteurs, smuggling them back to Communist Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFQc1kYqrQcC&pg=PA375&dq=bulgarians+IMRO&lr=&as_brr=3&hl=bg |title=Rebel with a just cause: a political journey against the winds of the 20th century, Spas Ra\u012dkin, Pensoft Publishers, 2001, p. 375 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=14 November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-954-642-130-2}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that Yugoslav Macedonian historical scholarship reluctantly acknowledged the Bulgarian ethnic self-identification of the Ilinden IMRO leaders, they were adopted in the national pantheon of Yugoslav Macedonia as ethnic Macedonians.

The 1903 Ilinden Uprising was presented as a direct precursor of the 1944 events, which were termed a \"Second Ilinden\", in an effort to prove the continuity of the struggle for independence of the Macedonian nation. Consequently, it became necessary for the socialist authorities to show that 19th century IMRO figures, particularly Delchev and Sandanski, had been consciously Macedonian in identity. Delchev and Sandanski were adopted as symbols of the republic, had numerous monuments built in their honor, and they were often the topic of articles in the academic journal ''[[Macedonian Review]]'', as was the Ilinden Uprising. In contrast, Todor Aleksandrov was labeled a Bulgarian bourgeois chauvinist. The claim to a Macedonian identity of Sandanski was used to bolster [[Skopje]]'s claim to the [[Blagoevgrad Province|Pirin region]].<ref name=\"LampeMazower2004cw\"/>\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] the situation was more complex, because the IMRO was associated with the 1923\u201334 anti-communist regime. Before 1960, although the subject was not taboo, few articles on the topic appeared in Bulgarian academic venues, and the IMRO figures were given mostly regional recognition in the Pirin region. After 1960, orders from the highest level were to reincorporate the Macedonian revolutionary movement in the Bulgarian history, and to prove the Bulgarian credentials of their historical leaders. This trend reached its peak in 1981 (the 1300 year anniversary of Bulgarian state), when Delchev and Sandanski were openly made historical symbols of the Bulgarian state in a proclamation of [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]. There were also attempts to rehabilitate Todor Aleksandrov because of his Bulgarian nationalism, but these remained controversial due to his role in suppressing the left wing, a role for which he had been declared a fascist.<ref name=\"LampeMazower2004cw\"/>\n\n== After the fall of communism ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}\nWith both Bulgaria and Yugoslavia under Communist rule, there was no scope for IMRO's revival.\n\n=== Republic of Macedonia ===\n[[File:Flag of the IMRO.svg|left|thumb|200px|Historical flag of IMRO.<ref>The statute of VMRO-BND, 2008 (in Bulgarian) Art. 3.

Many exiles returned to Macedonia from abroad, and a new generation of young Macedonian intellectuals rediscovered the history of Macedonian nationalism. In these circumstances, it was not surprising that the IMRO name was revived. A new IMRO was founded on 17 June 1990 in [[Skopje]]. Although IMRO claims a line descent from the old IMRO, there is no real connection between the old IMRO and the new one. The party is called the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]] (In {{lang-mk|Vnatre\u0161no-Makedonska Revolucionerna Organizacija-Demokratska Partija za Makedonsko Nacionalno Edinstvo}}, or VMRO-DPMNE) describes itself as a [[Christian Democratic]] party which supports the admission of Macedonia to [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].\n\nA minor political party carrying the name IMRO is the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization\u2013People's Party]] (VMRO-NP). Although a separate structure since the split in 2004, the political line of VMRO-NP is reminiscent of VMRO-DPMNE's and its members maintain close ties with the latter's party structure.\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[File:Vmro-bg-logo.png|right|thumb|150px|VMRO-BND logo.]]\nA distinct IMRO organization was also revived in Bulgaria after 1989 first under the name VMRO-SMD (\u0412\u041c\u0420\u041e-\u0421\u041c\u0414 \u2013 \u0421\u044a\u044e\u0437 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) and then simply VMRO (\u0412\u041c\u0420\u041e) as a cultural organisation.

Milley reportedly decided that he wanted to read the two-volume, 1,300-page, 500,000-word study before making a decision.  Milley also directed that an external panel of scholars review the work. After the panel returned glowing reviews on the study, including one that described the study as \"the gold standard in official history,\" Milley continued to delay publication so he could review the study further.\n\nIn September 2018, [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Mark Esper]] and other Army officials decided to distance themselves from the study by casting the study \"as an independent\" work of the authors, instead of being described as a project by the Chief of Staff of the Army's Operation Iraqi Freedom Study Group.\" When confronted by a journalist from the ''Wall Street Journal'' in October 2018, Milley reversed these decisions, ordering the study to be published officially, and with a foreword that he would write. He declared the team that wrote the study \"did a damn good job,\" that the study itself was \"a solid work,\" and noted that he aimed to publish the study by the holidays (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-army-ordered-an-unvarnished-iraq-war-historythen-let-it-languish-1540220153|title=The Army Stymied Its Own Study of the Iraq War|first=Michael R. |last=Gordon|date=October 22, 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref>\n\nWithin days of this revelation, two members of Congress who sit on the House Armed Services Committee (Reps. [[Jackie Speier]], D-California, and [[Ruben Gallego]], D-Arizona) sent a letter to Army leaders expressing their anger over the delay. In a press release accompanying the letter to Milley and Esper, Rep. Spier said, \"This is simply the Army being unwilling to publicly air its mistakes.

After the panel returned glowing reviews on the study, including one that described the study as \"the gold standard in official history,\" Milley continued to delay publication so he could review the study further.\n\nIn September 2018, [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Mark Esper]] and other Army officials decided to distance themselves from the study by casting the study \"as an independent\" work of the authors, instead of being described as a project by the Chief of Staff of the Army's Operation Iraqi Freedom Study Group.\" When confronted by a journalist from the ''Wall Street Journal'' in October 2018, Milley reversed these decisions, ordering the study to be published officially, and with a foreword that he would write. He declared the team that wrote the study \"did a damn good job,\" that the study itself was \"a solid work,\" and noted that he aimed to publish the study by the holidays (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-army-ordered-an-unvarnished-iraq-war-historythen-let-it-languish-1540220153|title=The Army Stymied Its Own Study of the Iraq War|first=Michael R. |last=Gordon|date=October 22, 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref>\n\nWithin days of this revelation, two members of Congress who sit on the House Armed Services Committee (Reps. [[Jackie Speier]], D-California, and [[Ruben Gallego]], D-Arizona) sent a letter to Army leaders expressing their anger over the delay. In a press release accompanying the letter to Milley and Esper, Rep. Spier said, \"This is simply the Army being unwilling to publicly air its mistakes. Our military, Congress, and the American people deserve nothing less than total transparency on the lessons the Army has identified so that we may use those lessons to avoid costly, and too often deadly, mistakes of the past.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2018/10/25/armys-detailed-iraq-war-study-remains-unpublished-years-after-completion/|title=Army\u2019s detailed Iraq war study remains unpublished years after completion|first=Todd |last=South|date=October 25, 2018|website=Army Times}}</ref> The study was published January 17, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102142425/https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1373|title=The U.S. Army in the Iraq War|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===\n[[File:Office Call 191031-A-PZ314-132.jpg|thumb|right|Gen.
