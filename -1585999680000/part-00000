Apps provide a specific set of functions which, by definition, do not include the running of the computer itself. Complex software designed for use on a [[personal computer]], for example, may have a related app designed for use on a [[mobile device]]. Today apps are normally designed to run on a specific [[operating system]]\u2014such as the contemporary [[iOS]], [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\u2014but in the past [[mobile carrier]]s had their own portals for apps and related media content.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.telecomcircle.com/2009/05/the-economics-of-mobile-application-stores/ | title=The Economics of Mobile Application Store| date=2009-05-17}}</ref>\n\n== Basic concept ==\nAn app store is any digital storefront intended to allow search and review of software titles or other media offered for sale electronically. Critically, the application storefront itself provides a secure, uniform experience that automates the electronic purchase, decryption and installation of software applications or other digital media. \n\nApp stores typically organize the apps they offer based on: the function(s) provided by the app (including games, multimedia or productivity), the device for which the app was designed, and the operating system on which the app will run.\n\nApp stores typically take the form of an [[Online shopping|online store]], where [[End-user|users]] can browse through these different app categories, view information about each app (such as reviews or ratings), and acquire the app (including app purchase, if necessary \u2013 many apps are offered at no cost). The selected app is offered as an automatic download, after which the app installs. Some app stores may also include a system to [[kill switch|automatically remove an installed program]] from devices under certain conditions, with the goal of protecting the user against malicious software.<ref name=cw-remotedisable>{{cite web|title=Microsoft: We can remotely delete Windows 8 apps|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9222518/Microsoft_We_can_remotely_delete_Windows_8_apps |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |accessdate=8 October 2013|date=2011-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nApp stores typically provide a way for users to give reviews and ratings. Those reviews are useful for other users, for developers and for app store owners. Users can select the best apps based on ratings, developers get feedback on what features are praised or disliked and finally, app store owners can detect bad apps and malicious developers by automatically analyzing the reviews with data mining techniques.<ref>{{Cite book  |doi=10.1109/MobileSoft.2015.8|isbn=978-0-7695-5566-9|chapter=A Recommender System of Buggy App Checkers for App Store Moderators|title=2015 2nd ACM International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems|pages=1\u201311|year=2015|last1=Gomez|first1=Maria|last2=Rouvoy|first2=Romain|last3=Monperrus|first3=Martin|last4=Seinturier|first4=Lionel|chapter-url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01079681/file/RR_BuggyAppCheckers-v2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nMany app stores are [[curator|curated]] by their owners, requiring that submissions of prospective apps go through an approval process. These apps are inspected for compliance with certain guidelines (such as those for [[quality control]] and [[censorship]]), including the requirement that a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] be collected on each sale of a paid app. Some app stores provides feedback to developers: number of installations, issues in the field (latency, crash, etc.).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gomez |first1=Maria |last2=Adams |first2=Bram |last3=Maalej |first3=Walid |last4=Monperrus |first4=Martin |last5=Rouvoy |first5=Romain |title=App Store 2.0: From Crowdsourced Information to Actionable Feedback in Mobile Ecosystems |journal=IEEE Software |date=March 2017 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=81\u201389 |doi=10.1109/ms.2017.46 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01406422/document|arxiv=1807.00518 }}</ref>\n\nResearchers have proposed new features for app stores.

Hongi does not trust the rival clan's leader, Wirepa, and follows him. As Hongi suspected, the visit is a ruse, and Wirepa desecrates the grave site as a pretext for war, blaming Hongi for disturbing the remains. Tane believes his son is innocent, but offers to kill Hongi if it will prevent war. Wirepa refuses, saying war is imminent. Wirepa's clan returns later in force, kills the men of the tribe and beheads Tane, taking his head as a trophy. Hongi is knocked away from the battle, and survives. \n\nHongi leaves and attempts to track down Wirepa. On the way, he discovers that Wirepa and his men have entered the Dead Lands, an area where any men who venture into are believed to be killed by a monster. Hongi, suspecting that the monster is in fact a man, tracks him down and, although reluctant, the monster agrees to help Hongi hunt down Wirepa. The monster is in fact a warrior (who is never named in the film) who murdered all the men of his own tribe, and he kills anyone who ventures there to prevent his tribe's historic lands from being occupied. The warrior is motivated by a desire to redeem himself and thus be led to the afterlife by his vengeful ancestors. \n\nWhile tracking down Wirepa, Hongi has a series of visions of his long dead grandmother, who helps them on their way. Hongi and the warrior track down Wirepa, and several of his men are killed before Wirepa and his surviving warriors flee. Hongi and the warrior go after them, and the warrior kills a small band of hunters they come across to keep his identity a secret. Hongi is devastated by this, and screams at the warrior. The two separate, but the warrior has a vision from his ancestors that convinces him to continue helping Hongi. \n\nWirepa and his men are tracked to a mountaintop fort, where they barricade themselves inside. Wirepa taunts Hongi with his fathers head, angering him, but the warrior convinces him to regroup and return later. Wirepa's men leave Tane's head on a spike, and most of the men leave the fort. Again, this is a ruse by Wirepa to lure Hongi in. However, when the trap is sprung, the warrior and Hongi get the upper hand and kill most of Wirepa's men. While Hongi battles Wirepa, the warrior is severely wounded but manages to return and save Hongi. Wirepa, distracted from his battle with Hongi, beats the warrior to the ground before returning his attention to Hongi. This time Hongi gains the upper hand, and is about to kill Wirepa. This pleases Wirepa, because it will allow him to be remembered as a great warrior who died in battle about whom songs will be sung, and stories will be told. Hongi denies Wirepa this honor, spares his life and makes him swear to leave his land, and allows him to leave. Defeated and alone, Wirepa walks off in shame. \n\nHongi returns to the warrior, who is mortally wounded. Hongi adopts the warrior into his clan, so that his own ancestors will guide the warrior into the afterlife. The film ends with a final vision of Hongi's grandmother, who is very pleased, as Hongi begins his return home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Rolleston]] as Hongi\n* [[Lawrence Makoare]] as The Warrior\n* [[Rena Owen]] as the Grandmother \n* [[Te Kohe Tuhaka]] as Wirepa\n* [[Xavier Horan]] as Rangi\n* [[Raukura Turei]] as Mehe\n* [[George Henare]] as Tane\n* [[Matariki Whatarau]] as Tama\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews. It is \"certified fresh\" with a score of 66% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews. The critics consensus reads: 'The Dead Lands doesn't add anything new to the primeval quest genre, but its battle scenes boast enough visceral thrills to carry viewers through the more mundane moments.' Simon Abrams of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film 2 stars out of 4. Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' put it in her top ten films of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/best-films-at-toronto-venice-731526|title=Critics' Roundup: 10 Best Films From the Major Fall Festivals (So Far)|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==TV adaptation==\nIn 2019, [[AMC Entertainment]]'s streaming service [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]] and TVNZ said they would create a TV series based on the film.

This pleases Wirepa, because it will allow him to be remembered as a great warrior who died in battle about whom songs will be sung, and stories will be told. Hongi denies Wirepa this honor, spares his life and makes him swear to leave his land, and allows him to leave. Defeated and alone, Wirepa walks off in shame. \n\nHongi returns to the warrior, who is mortally wounded. Hongi adopts the warrior into his clan, so that his own ancestors will guide the warrior into the afterlife. The film ends with a final vision of Hongi's grandmother, who is very pleased, as Hongi begins his return home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Rolleston]] as Hongi\n* [[Lawrence Makoare]] as The Warrior\n* [[Rena Owen]] as the Grandmother \n* [[Te Kohe Tuhaka]] as Wirepa\n* [[Xavier Horan]] as Rangi\n* [[Raukura Turei]] as Mehe\n* [[George Henare]] as Tane\n* [[Matariki Whatarau]] as Tama\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews. It is \"certified fresh\" with a score of 66% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews. The critics consensus reads: 'The Dead Lands doesn't add anything new to the primeval quest genre, but its battle scenes boast enough visceral thrills to carry viewers through the more mundane moments.' Simon Abrams of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film 2 stars out of 4. Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' put it in her top ten films of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/best-films-at-toronto-venice-731526|title=Critics' Roundup: 10 Best Films From the Major Fall Festivals (So Far)|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==TV adaptation==\nIn 2019, [[AMC Entertainment]]'s streaming service [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]] and TVNZ said they would create a TV series based on the film.

This enzyme is a powerful [[antioxidant]] that protects the body from damage caused by [[superoxide]], a toxic free radical generated in the mitochondria. [[Free radicals]] are highly reactive molecules produced by cells during normal [[metabolism]]. Free radicals can cause damage to DNA and proteins within cells. To date, over 110 different mutations in ''SOD1'' have been linked with the disorder, some of which (such as  [[H46R]]) have a very long clinical course, while others, such as [[SOD1#A4V|A4V]], are exceptionally aggressive. When the defenses against oxidative stress fail, programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) is upregulated. \nTo date, 180 different mutations in SOD1 gene are known to cause familial ALS.<ref name=tokuda>{{cite journal | author = Tokuda E, Furukawa Y | year = 2016 | title = Copper Homeostasis as a Therapeutic Target in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with SOD1 Mutations | pmc=4881462 | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 5| page = 636 | doi = 10.3390/ijms17050636 | pmid=27136532}}</ref>\n\nA defect in SOD1 could be a loss or gain of function.

It was the first time that [[linkage analysis]] was successful in identifying the genetic cause of a rare neurodegenerative disorder.<ref name=\"Nature Neuroscience 2014\"/> ''SOD1'' is one of the most common genes associated with ALS, accounting for about 12% of fALS and 1-2% of sALS. The second gene, ''[[NEFH]]'', was identified in 1994, followed by ''[[SETX]]'' in 1998, ''[[ALS2]]'' in 2001, ''[[DCTN1]]'' in 2003, and ''[[CHMP2B]]'' in 2006. All of these genes are fairly rare; the next major ALS gene, ''[[TARDBP]]'', was identified in 2008 and accounts for 4% of fALS and 1% of sALS. ''[[FUS (gene)|FUS]]'' was identified in 2009 and is seen in 4% of fALS and 1% of sALS. ''[[Valosin-containing protein|VCP]]'' was identified in 2010 and accounts for 1% of fALS and 1% of sALS; ''[[ATXN2]]'', ''[[Optineurin|OPTN]]'', and ''[[UBQLN2]]'' were associated with ALS that same year.<ref name=\"Lancet 2018\"/>\n\nAnother major milestone was the discovery of ''[[C9orf72]]'' in 2011, which is the most common gene associated with ALS, accounting for about 40% of fALS cases and 7% of sALS cases. ''C9orf72'' was also found to contribute significantly to frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ''[[SQSTM1]]'' was also identified in 2011, but accounts for 1% of fALS and less than 1% of sALS. ''[[PFN1]]'' was identified in 2012, ''[[HNRNPA1]]'' and ''[[HNRNPA2B1]]'' in 2013, ''[[CHCHD10]]'', ''[[MATR3]]'', and ''[[TUBA4A]]'' in 2014, and ''[[TANK-binding kinase 1|TBK1]]'' in 2015. ''[[C21orf2]]'', ''[[CCNF]]'', and ''[[NEK1]]'' were associated with ALS in 2016.<ref name=\"Lancet 2018\"/>\n\nThe first [[genome-wide association study]] (GWAS) of ALS was published in 2007, and 14 GWASs total had been published through 2013. They have contributed significantly to our understanding of ALS genetics; for example, a 2010 GWAS studying ALS in Finland led to discovery of the role of mutations at the ''C9orf72'' locus in ALS. However, a gene identified by a single GWAS may not actually be associated with ALS, especially if the cohort size is small. In outbred populations, thousands of cases (people with ALS) and controls (people without ALS) are required for a GWAS to have sufficient [[statistical power]] to confidently identify a gene's association with ALS.<ref name=\"Nature Neuroscience 2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}\n\n[[Category:Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]\n", "text_old": "There are more than 25 genes known to be associated with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) as of June 2018,<ref name=\"Trends in Genetics 2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Nguyen |first1=Hung Phuoc |last2=Van Broeckhoven |first2=Christine |last3=van der Zee |first3=Julie  |date=June 2018 |title=ALS Genes in the Genomic Era and their Implications for FTD |url=https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(18)30054-4 |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=404\u2013423 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2018.03.001|pmid=29605155 }}</ref> which collectively account for about 70% of cases of familial ALS (fALS) and 15% of cases of sporadic ALS (sALS).<ref name=\"Lancet 2018\"/> About 5\u201310% of cases of ALS are directly inherited from a person's parents.<ref name=Lancet2011>{{cite journal|last1=Kiernan|first1=MC|last2=Vucic|first2=S|last3=Cheah|first3=BC|last4=Turner|first4=MR|last5=Eisen|first5=A|last6=Hardiman|first6=O|last7=Burrell|first7=JR|last8=Zoing|first8=MC|title=Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.|journal=Lancet|date=12 March 2011|volume=377|issue=9769|pages=942\u201355|pmid=21296405|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61156-7}}</ref> Overall, [[first-degree relative]]s of an individual with ALS have a 1% risk of developing ALS.<ref name=\"CooksonWingo2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Cookson|first1=Mark R.|last2=Wingo|first2=Thomas S.|last3=Cutler|first3=David J.|last4=Yarab|first4=Nicole|last5=Kelly|first5=Crystal M.|last6=Glass|first6=Jonathan D.|title=The Heritability of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in a Clinically Ascertained United States Research Registry|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=11|year=2011|pages=e27985|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0027985|pmid=22132186|pmc=3222666}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sontheimer |first=Harald |date=2015 |title=Diseases of the Nervous System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_1PBAAAQBAJ |publisher=Academic Press |page=170 |isbn=978-0-12-800403-6 |access-date=2015-05-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908005608/https://books.google.com/books?id=U_1PBAAAQBAJ |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ALS has an [[oligogenic inheritance|oligogenic mode of inheritance]], meaning that mutations in two or more genes are required to cause disease.<ref name=\"Nature Neuroscience 2014\"/>\n\n''[[C9orf72]]'' is the most common gene associated with ALS, causing 40% of familial cases of ALS, as well as a small percentage of sporadic cases;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet|title=Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Fact Sheet {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref> it also causes about 25% of familial cases of frontotemporal dementia.<ref name=\"Nature Neuroscience 2014\"/> The pathogenic mutation is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (a series of six nucleotides repeated over and over); the more repeats in ''C9orf72'', the more pathogenic the mutation.

It was the first time that [[linkage analysis]] was successful in identifying the genetic cause of a rare neurodegenerative disorder.<ref name=\"Nature Neuroscience 2014\"/> ''SOD1'' is one of the most common genes associated with ALS, accounting for about 12% of fALS and 1-2% of sALS. The second gene, ''[[NEFH]]'', was identified in 1994, followed by ''[[SETX]]'' in 1998, ''[[ALS2]]'' in 2001, ''[[DCTN1]]'' in 2003, and ''[[CHMP2B]]'' in 2006. All of these genes are fairly rare; the next major ALS gene, ''[[TARDBP]]'', was identified in 2008 and accounts for 4% of fALS and 1% of sALS. ''[[FUS (gene)|FUS]]'' was identified in 2009 and is seen in 4% of fALS and 1% of sALS. ''[[Valosin-containing protein|VCP]]'' was identified in 2010 and accounts for 1% of fALS and 1% of sALS; ''[[ATXN2]]'', ''[[Optineurin|OPTN]]'', and ''[[UBQLN2]]'' were associated with ALS that same year.<ref name=\"Lancet 2018\"/>\n\nAnother major milestone was the discovery of ''[[C9orf72]]'' in 2011, which is the most common gene associated with ALS, accounting for about 40% of fALS cases and 7% of sALS cases. ''C9orf72'' was also found to contribute significantly to frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ''[[SQSTM1]]'' was also identified in 2011, but accounts for 1% of fALS and less than 1% of sALS. ''[[PFN1]]'' was identified in 2012, ''[[HNRNPA1]]'' and ''[[HNRNPA2B1]]'' in 2013, ''[[CHCHD10]]'', ''[[MATR3]]'', and ''[[TUBA4A]]'' in 2014, and ''[[TANK-binding kinase 1|TBK1]]'' in 2015. ''[[C21orf2]]'', ''[[CCNF]]'', and ''[[NEK1]]'' were associated with ALS in 2016.<ref name=\"Lancet 2018\"/>\n\nThe first [[genome-wide association study]] (GWAS) of ALS was published in 2007, and 14 GWASs total had been published through 2013. They have contributed significantly to our understanding of ALS genetics; for example, a 2010 GWAS studying ALS in Finland led to discovery of the role of mutations at the ''C9orf72'' locus in ALS. However, a gene identified by a single GWAS may not actually be associated with ALS, especially if the cohort size is small. In outbred populations, thousands of cases (people with ALS) and controls (people without ALS) are required for a GWAS to have sufficient [[statistical power]] to confidently identify a gene's association with ALS.<ref name=\"Nature Neuroscience 2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_of_amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"}
