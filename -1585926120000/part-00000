Perhaps best known for his seven-fight stint in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC), where he ultimately accumulated a 1-6 record, he also competed in the [[Cage Rage Championships]], [[K-1]], and [[Pancrase]]. Sinosic fought for the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship]] at [[UFC 32]].\n\n==Biography==\nSinosic was born in Canberra, Australia to [[Croats|Croatian]] immigrant parents, and now resides in Sydney, Australia. He currently runs Sinosic Perosh Martial Arts SPMA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spma.net.au|title=SPMA \u2013 Best Sydney club with MMA, BJJ, Kickboxing classes and training|website=Spma.net.au|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref> with business and training partner [[Anthony Perosh]]. Having trained in various arts for over 20 years dating back to his early twenties, Sinosic was exposed to a myriad of art forms including: [[Freestyle Wrestling]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[boxing]], [[Jeet kune do]], [[Filipino martial arts]], [[Silat]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Capoeira]], [[Kickboxing]], [[Judo]], [[John Will (fighter)|JB Will]] [[Shootfighting]], [[Pankration]], [[Jujutsu]] and Machado BJJ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spma.net.au/instructors.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913194658/http://www.spma.net.au/instructors.php |archivedate=13 September 2009  }}</ref>\n\nCompeting on an international level for major organizations such as the [[Abu Dhabi]] World Submission Championships, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] and the [[K-1|K-1 Grand Prix]], Sinosic also fought in [[Pancrase]], [[RINGS]], Warriors Realm, Fighter Extreme, Universal Combat Challenge (UCC) (now called TKO Major League MMA (TKO)), [[Cage Rage]], Australian Vale Tudo Open and Caged Combat.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nConsidered by some to be a pioneer of Australian mixed martial arts, Sinosic fought on the first ever Australian MMA show, Caged Combat. He competed for and won the first ever Australian MMA title, the Australian Vale Tudo Heavyweight Championship. He was also the first Australian to fight for a nominal World Title (Universal Combat Challenge 1 vs Dave Beneteau), and was the first Australian to fight in an MMA match in [[K-1]] when he lost at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2000]] vs Frank Shamrock. He was also the first Australian to fight in the UFC - [[UFC 30]] vs [[Jeremy Horn]] - his only winning performance with the organization, where he was the first Australian to fight for a UFC World Championship ([[UFC 32]] in a loss vs. [[Tito Ortiz]]). Sinosic was also  the first Australian to compete in the ADCC World Submission Wrestling Championships when he competed in the inaugural event in 1998, defeating unheralded grappler Clarence Thatch before being submitted by [[Renato Verissimo]].\n\n===UFC career===\nSinosic is a UFC veteran holding a record of 1 win and 6 losses within the UFC, at the time the statistically worst record in promotional history, contributing to the 8 wins, 12 losses and 2 draws in his mixed martial arts career. He made his UFC debut defeating [[Jeremy Horn]] by [[armbar]] at [[UFC 30]], considered a huge upset at the time, and was then offered a match with [[Tito Ortiz]], who was then the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] at [[UFC 32]]. Sinosic was defeated by Ortiz in the first round via [[Technical knockout]] (TKO).\n\nSubsequently, he fought several times in the UFC, with matches against [[Evan Tanner]] (TKO loss), [[Renato Sobral]] (decision loss), [[Forrest Griffin]] (KO loss), and [[Alessio Sakara]] (decision loss) at [[UFC 57]]. Following his historically unsuccessful stint with the UFC, he defeated regional fighters Shamoji Fuiji and [[Mark Epstein]] both by [[armbar]].\n\nSinosic's last fight in the UFC was a loss to [[Michael Bisping]] due to TKO (strikes) at [[UFC 70]].\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martialarts.about.com/od/eventsandcompetitions/ig/UFC-70-Results/UFC-70---Bisping-vs-Sinosic.htm |title=Archived

Perhaps best known for his seven-fight stint in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC), where he ultimately accumulated a 1-6 record, he also competed in the [[Cage Rage Championships]], [[K-1]], and [[Pancrase]]. Sinosic fought for the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship]] at [[UFC 32]].\n\n==Biography==\nSinosic was born in Canberra, Australia to [[Croats|Croatian]] immigrant parents, and now resides in Sydney, Australia. He currently runs Sinosic Perosh Martial Arts SPMA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spma.net.au|title=SPMA \u2013 Best Sydney club with MMA, BJJ, Kickboxing classes and training|website=Spma.net.au|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref> with business and training partner [[Anthony Perosh]]. Having trained in various arts for over 20 years dating back to his early twenties, Sinosic was exposed to a myriad of art forms including: [[Freestyle Wrestling]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[boxing]], [[Jeet kune do]], [[Filipino martial arts]], [[Silat]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Capoeira]], [[Kickboxing]], [[Judo]], [[John Will (fighter)|JB Will]] [[Shootfighting]], [[Pankration]], [[Jujutsu]] and Machado BJJ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spma.net.au/instructors.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913194658/http://www.spma.net.au/instructors.php |archivedate=13 September 2009  }}</ref>\n\nCompeting on an international level for major organizations such as the [[Abu Dhabi]] World Submission Championships, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] and the [[K-1|K-1 Grand Prix]], Sinosic also fought in [[Pancrase]], [[RINGS]], Warriors Realm, Fighter Extreme, Universal Combat Challenge (UCC) (now called TKO Major League MMA (TKO)), [[Cage Rage]], Australian Vale Tudo Open and Caged Combat.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nConsidered by some to be a pioneer of Australian mixed martial arts, Sinosic fought on the first ever Australian MMA show, Caged Combat. He competed for and won the first ever Australian MMA title, the Australian Vale Tudo Heavyweight Championship. He was also the first Australian to fight for a nominal World Title (Universal Combat Challenge 1 vs Dave Beneteau), and was the first Australian to fight in an MMA match in [[K-1]] when he lost at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2000]] vs Frank Shamrock. He was also the first Australian to fight in the UFC - [[UFC 30]] vs [[Jeremy Horn]] - his only winning performance with the organization, where he was the first Australian to fight for a UFC World Championship ([[UFC 32]] in a loss vs. [[Tito Ortiz]]). Sinosic was also  the first Australian to compete in the ADCC World Submission Wrestling Championships when he competed in the inaugural event in 1998, defeating unheralded grappler Clarence Thatch before being submitted by [[Renato Verissimo]]/\n\n===UFC career===\nSinosic is a UFC veteran holding a record of 1 win and 6 losses within the UFC, at the time the statistically worst record in promotional history, contributing to the 8 wins, 12 losses and 2 draws in his mixed martial arts career. He made his UFC debut defeating [[Jeremy Horn]] by [[armbar]] at [[UFC 30]], considered a huge upset at the time, and was then offered a match with [[Tito Ortiz]], who was then the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] at [[UFC 32]]. Sinosic was defeated by Ortiz in the first round via [[Technical knockout]] (TKO).\n\nSubsequently, he fought several times in the UFC, with matches against [[Evan Tanner]] (TKO loss), [[Renato Sobral]] (decision loss), [[Forrest Griffin]] (KO loss), and [[Alessio Sakara]] (decision loss) at [[UFC 57]]. Following his historically unsuccessful stint with the UFC, he defeated regional fighters Shamoji Fuiji and [[Mark Epstein]] both by [[armbar]].\n\nSinosic's last fight in the UFC was a loss to [[Michael Bisping]] due to TKO (strikes) at [[UFC 70]].\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martialarts.about.com/od/eventsandcompetitions/ig/UFC-70-Results/UFC-70---Bisping-vs-Sinosic.htm |title=Archived

This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]] as ''Thunder Hour'', a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] briefly aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form. Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = July 26, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990, and aired on Monday nights as part of the network's ''Feet, Fists and Fury'' programming block that also included [[kickboxing]] and [[boxing]].<ref>https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-09-17-OCR-Page-0043.pdf</ref>\n\nA famous [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] occurred during a semifinal [[UWF Beach Brawl#SportsChannel Television Championship tournament brackets|SportsChannel Television Championship Tournament]] match between Steve Ray and [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] in May 1991. Allegedly, [[Herb Abrams]] thought Ray was sleeping with his wife and paid Williams extra money to rough Ray up during the bout. Ray would claim years later that this was a [[worked shoot]] and both competitors had agreed to work stiff with each other prior to the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nAbrams signed a deal with [[Prime Ticket]] in June 1992 for the production and broadcast of new content.<ref>Meltzer, Dave.

The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] briefly aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form. Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = July 26, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990, and aired on Monday nights as part of the network's ''Feet, Fists and Fury'' programming block that also included [[kickboxing]] and [[boxing]].<ref>https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-09-17-OCR-Page-0043.pdf</ref>\n\nA famous [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] occurred during a semifinal [[UWF Beach Brawl#SportsChannel Television Championship tournament brackets|SportsChannel Television Championship Tournament]] match between Steve Ray and [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] in May 1991. Allegedly, [[Herb Abrams]] thought Ray was sleeping with his wife and paid Williams extra money to rough Ray up during the bout. Ray would claim years later that this was a [[worked shoot]] and both competitors had agreed to work stiff with each other prior to the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nAbrams signed a deal with [[Prime Ticket]] in June 1992 for the production and broadcast of new content.<ref>Meltzer, Dave.

In 1993, the UWF released six volumes of [[PAL]] videos in Germany through Summit International Pictures under the \"Wrestling Super Champs\" banner. They were all compilations of Fury Hour matches.

Each of the seven [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] DVDs contains one episode of ''Fury Hour''. The DVDs include ''Body Slammin'', ''Grand Slam'', ''Grudge Matches'', ''It's War'', ''Tag Team Madness'', ''The Main Event'', and ''Wrestling Wars''. In Germany, a [[DVD region code|Region 0]] DVD titled \"Wrestling Super 4 Champs\" was released containing two episodes of ''Fury Hour''.

{"title_page": "BTEC Extended Diploma", "text_new": "The '''BTEC (Business and Technology Education Council) Level 3 diploma''' is a [[Further Education]] qualification and [[vocational education|vocational qualification]] taken in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The qualification is organised and awarded by Pearson within the [[Business And Technology Education Council (BTEC)|BTEC]] brand and it is equivalent to [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-Levels]].\nIt is regarded as equivalent in level to the [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Levels]], more specifically to three [[Advanced Level (UK)|A2]] awards and the [[AVCE]].\n\nThis qualification is taken in order to gain entry to [[Higher education]]. Nevertheless, as it is mostly coursework based, universities like [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] or [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] may require it to be combined with more traditional qualifications, such as one [[A level]].\n\nMany students taking BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma qualifications from September 2016 or September 2017 will now also be assessed through external assessments in the form of exams.\n\n==Background==\nThe BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma dates back to the 1930s as a full-time three-year course. After the Haselgrave Report, the Business Education Council (BEC) and Technician Education Council (TEC) took over the accrediting of this qualification (called the \"Ordinary National Diploma\") and others in the stable, such as the National Certificate, [[Higher National Certificate]] and [[Higher National Diploma]]. The portfolio of courses was integrated when the BEC and TEC merged to form BTEC.\n\nThe ''Ordinary National Diploma'' is a vocational qualification at Level 3. It is a course that lasts two years and has 18 units altogether unlike the [[Advanced VCE]] that is only worth two (Double Award). This is often a very good alternative way to achieve A Levels in the UK, excluding parts of Scotland.\n\nThe course is available from [[Edexcel]] and is in many different subjects. This qualification is mainly studied in further education colleges and along with the right passes at [[GCSE]], can qualify you for degree level at university.\n\nAs [[Business And Technology Education Council (BTEC)|BTEC]] stands for Business and Technology Education Council, the best known subjects for a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma are [[business]] and [[Information Technology]]. This qualification has become more popular recently, especially with the demise of the [[AVCE]].\n\nThe course is assessed in units, consisting of 18 in total. Students are assessed by coursework only and Possibly 2 Internal Exams.\n\nOn graduation, students are permitted to use the postnominals OND or Dip after their name, usually followed by the course name in brackets.\n\n==Level==\nThe BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma is particularly suitable for those who have strong inclinations towards a particular vocational career, starting with technical level posts and leading, after experience, to supervisory and enterprise management posts. The BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma is popular amongst school leavers who wish to pursue [[Nursing]], [[Midwifery]] or other health professions as the BTEC Health course gives more thorough preparation than A Levels would for the degree course. The work placement element of the BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma is particularly valued by universities considering admissions for these subjects.\n\nThe usual entry requirement is at least five [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] subject passes at A*, A, B or C grades, covering English, Maths and Science. In most land-based industries, science (usually double science) will be a preferred subject, together with Maths and English. Equivalent entry qualifications are also accepted, including an appropriate [[BTEC First Diploma]] with a merit grade or a relevant [[NVQ]] at Level 2 or an Intermediate [[GNVQ]].\n\nOther qualifications and experience may be acceptable for [[mature student]]s. Mature students are advised, in some cases, to consider a Higher National Diploma (HND) course instead. Career experience frequently leads to an ability to cope with HND level education and the two year commitment can be better spent in acquiring a higher qualification.\n\nIt is possible for a student to be accepted onto a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma course without the recommended entry requirements, this is generally the case in students who have left school and acquired a job in the field of the subject that is relevant to the course. If the college is satisfied that the student has the ability to benefit successfully from the course. Students with a good National Certificate or equivalent qualification may be considered for entry to the second year of the National Diploma course in which case \"bridging\" studies may be necessary.\n\nIt is possible for students on the BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma to leave the course after 1 and 1/4 years with a [[BTEC National Certificate]], having to achieve Pass grades in all of the units from the first year.\n\nIt contains two booklets which are about 100 pages long.\n\n==Subjects==\n\n===Art and Design===\nThe subject alone is available.
