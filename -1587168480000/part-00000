In an interview he said, \"I feel I am representing all Jews and all Israelis.\" He was the first spaceflight participant to request [[kosher]] food. He reportedly sought advice from a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] rabbi, Zvi Konikov, about how to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]] in space, as the period between sunrises in orbit is approximately 90 minutes.

The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, [[Ava Kingdom]] and [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. The kingdom was a protectorate of the [[Bengal Sultanate]] at different time periods.<ref name=kh-2-25>Maung Maung Tin, Vol. 2, p. 25</ref>\n\nEarly on, Ava fought [[Forty Years' War|wars of unification]] (1385\u20131424) but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, the [[Mon people|Mon]]-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the [[Confederation of Shan States]] conquered Ava itself, and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.\n\nLike the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for [[Culture of Myanmar|Burmese culture]]. [[Burmese literature]] \"grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse\", and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest [[Burmese chronicles|pan-Burma chronicles]] emerged.<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 134</ref> Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], pp. 64\u201365</ref> Many splendid temples of Mrauk U were built during this period.\n\n===Taungoo and colonialism===\n[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|[[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] under [[Bayinnaung]] in 1580.]]\nPolitical unification returned in the mid-16th century, due to the efforts of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]], a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious king [[Tabinshwehti]] defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the [[Toungoo\u2013Hanthawaddy War (1534\u201341)]]. His successor [[Bayinnaung]] went on to conquer a vast swath of [[mainland Southeast Asia]] including the Shan states, [[Lan Na]], Manipur, [[Mong Mao]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], [[Lan Xang]] and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mercenaries established [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese rule]] at [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam).\n\nThe dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]]. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated [[Meitei people|Meithei]] raids into [[Upper Myanmar]] and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.\n\n[[File:Shwedagon pagoda.jpg|thumb|A British 1825 lithograph of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] shows British occupation during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].]]\nAfter the fall of Ava, the [[Konbaung\u2013Hanthawaddy War]] involved one resistance group under [[Alaungpaya]] defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759, he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur, and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of [[Laos]] (1765) and fought and won the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)]] against Ayutthaya and the [[Sino-Burmese War (1765\u201369)]] against [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] (1765\u20131769).<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\nWith Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770, and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King [[Bodawpaya]] turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with [[British India]].<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], p. 109</ref>\n\nThe breadth of this empire was short lived. Burma lost Arakan, [[Manipur]], Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824\u20131826). In 1852, the British easily seized [[Lower Burma]] in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. King [[Mindon Min]] tried to modernise the kingdom, and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[French Indochina]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1885.\n\nKonbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms, and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females).<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 202\u2013206</ref> Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.\n\n===British Burma (1824\u20131948)===\n{{main|British rule in Burma|Burma Campaign}}\n\n====Burma in British India====\n[[File:British forces arrival mandalay1885.jpg|thumb|The landing of British forces in Mandalay after the last of the [[Anglo-Burmese War]]s, which resulted in the abdication of the last Burmese monarch, King [[Thibaw Min]].]]\n[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|British troops firing a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] on the [[Mawchi]] road, July 1944.]]\n\nThe eighteenth century saw Burmese rulers, whose country had not previously been of particular interest to European traders, seek to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of [[Assam]], Manipur and [[Rakhine State|Arakan]].

He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition.

They destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides. After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. The British then granted independence to the colony, and handed over their plans to rebuild to the new government. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister [[U Nu]] embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two-thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period). Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/burma.htm |title=Political and Economic History of Myanmar (Burma) Economics |access-date=8 July 2006|last=Watkins |first=Thayer |publisher=San Jose State University}}</ref>\n\nThe 1962 coup d'\u00e9tat was followed by an economic scheme called the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]], a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture.

The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from [[Nanzhao]] between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the [[Bamar people]] founded a small settlement at [[Bagan]]. It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century when it grew in authority and grandeur.<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Imperial Burma===\n{{main|Pagan Kingdom|Taungoo Dynasty|Konbaung Dynasty}}\n{{See also|Ava Kingdom|Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Kingdom of Mrauk U|Shan States}}\n\n[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|[[Pagoda]]s and [[kyaung]]s in present-day [[Bagan]], the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]].]]\nPagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s\u20131060s when [[Anawrahta]] founded the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the [[Khmer Empire]] were two main powers in [[mainland Southeast Asia]].<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 24</ref> The [[Burmese language]] and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Pali]] norms by the late 12th century.<ref name=mha-63-65>{{cite book | last=Htin Aung | first=Maung | title=A History of Burma | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin | url-access=registration | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York and London | year=1967|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin/page/63 63\u201365]}}</ref>\n\n[[Theravada]] Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although [[Vajrayana|Tantric]], [[Mahayana]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Burmese folk religion|folk religion]] remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] (1277\u20131301) toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.<ref name=mha-63-65 />\n\n[[File:MysticalMraukU.jpg|thumb|Temples at [[Mrauk U]].]]\nPagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, [[Shan people|Shan migrants]] who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing [[Shan States]] came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, [[Ava Kingdom]] and [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. The kingdom was a protectorate of the [[Bengal Sultanate]] at different time periods.<ref name=kh-2-25>Maung Maung Tin, Vol. 2, p. 25</ref>\n\nEarly on, Ava fought [[Forty Years' War|wars of unification]] (1385\u20131424) but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, the [[Mon people|Mon]]-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the [[Confederation of Shan States]] conquered Ava itself, and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.\n\nLike the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for [[Culture of Myanmar|Burmese culture]]. [[Burmese literature]] \"grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse\", and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest [[Burmese chronicles|pan-Burma chronicles]] emerged.<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 134</ref> Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], pp. 64\u201365</ref> Many splendid temples of Mrauk U were built during this period.\n\n===Taungoo and colonialism===\n[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|[[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] under [[Bayinnaung]] in 1580.]]\nPolitical unification returned in the mid-16th century, due to the efforts of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]], a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious king [[Tabinshwehti]] defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the [[Toungoo\u2013Hanthawaddy War (1534\u201341)]]. His successor [[Bayinnaung]] went on to conquer a vast swath of [[mainland Southeast Asia]] including the Shan states, [[Lan Na]], Manipur, [[Mong Mao]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], [[Lan Xang]] and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mercenaries established [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese rule]] at [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam).\n\nThe dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]]. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated [[Meitei people|Meithei]] raids into [[Upper Myanmar]] and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.\n\n[[File:Shwedagon pagoda.jpg|thumb|A British 1825 lithograph of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] shows British occupation during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].]]\nAfter the fall of Ava, the [[Konbaung\u2013Hanthawaddy War]] involved one resistance group under [[Alaungpaya]] defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759, he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur, and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of [[Laos]] (1765) and fought and won the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)]] against Ayutthaya and the [[Sino-Burmese War (1765\u201369)]] against [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] (1765\u20131769).<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 184\u2013187</ref>\n\nWith Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770, and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King [[Bodawpaya]] turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with [[British India]].<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], p. 109</ref>\n\nThe breadth of this empire was short lived. Burma lost Arakan, [[Manipur]], Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824\u20131826). In 1852, the British easily seized [[Lower Burma]] in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. King [[Mindon Min]] tried to modernise the kingdom, and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[French Indochina]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1885.\n\nKonbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms, and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females).<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 202\u2013206</ref> Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.\n\n===British Burma (1824\u20131948)===\n{{main|British rule in Burma|Burma Campaign}}\n\n====Burma in British India====\n[[File:British forces arrival mandalay1885.jpg|thumb|The landing of British forces in Mandalay after the last of the [[Anglo-Burmese War]]s, which resulted in the abdication of the last Burmese monarch, King [[Thibaw Min]].]]\n[[File:IND 004723.jpg|thumb|British troops firing a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] on the [[Mawchi]] road, July 1944.]]\n\nThe eighteenth century saw Burmese rulers, whose country had not previously been of particular interest to European traders, seek to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of [[Assam]], Manipur and [[Rakhine State|Arakan]].

They destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides. After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. The British then granted independence to the colony, and handed over their plans to rebuild to the new government. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister [[U Nu]] embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two-thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period). Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/burma.htm |title=Political and Economic History of Myanmar (Burma) Economics |access-date=8 July 2006|last=Watkins |first=Thayer |publisher=San Jose State University}}</ref>\n\nThe 1962 coup d'\u00e9tat was followed by an economic scheme called the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]], a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture.
