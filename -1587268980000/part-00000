Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano Valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as \"Coquerel's mouse lemur\".{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|p=67}}\n\nIn 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;zaza'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} Their studies compared the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Cytochrome b|mitochondrial cytochrome b]] [[Sequencing|sequences]] of specimens from both [[Kirindy Forest]] in central-western Madagascar and around [[Ambato, Madagascar|Ambato]] in northwestern Madagascar,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} part of the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, [[sociality]], and [[Reproduction|breeding]], as well as sufficient [[genetic distance]] to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}\n\nThe [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced in 2010 that a [[biodiversity]] study from 2009 in the [[gallery forest]] of [[Ranobe, Madagascar|Ranobe]] near [[Toliara]] in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed.

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus''). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} with fork-marked lemurs being either a [[sister group]] of all cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} or more closely related to [[sportive lemur]]s (''Lepilemur'').{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}\n\nAlthough ''Mirza'', ''Microcebus'', and ''Allocebus'' form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, the three lineages are thought to have [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|pp=1627\u20131628}} All three are thought to have diverged at least 20&nbsp;[[myr|mya]] (million years ago),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}} although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between ''Mirza'' and ''Microcebus'' at 24.2&nbsp;mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1&nbsp;mya.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=15}}\n\n==Description==\nThough giant mouse lemurs are relatively small cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} they are more than three times larger than the smallest members of the family, the mouse lemurs.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their body weight averages {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} At around {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}}, their bushy and long tail is longer than their head-body length, which averages {{convert|233|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs (with an [[intermembral index]] of 70), a trait shared with mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|pp=60\u201361}} The skull is similar to that of dwarf and mouse lemurs,{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} and the [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|auditory bullae]] are small.{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}}\n\nLike other cheirogaleids, the [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] for giant mouse lemurs is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=2.1.3.3|total=36}}; on each side of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two [[incisor]]s, one [[Canine tooth|canine]], three premolars, and three [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]\u2014a total of 36&nbsp;teeth.{{Sfn|Swindler|2002|p=73}} Their upper teeth converge towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}} The first upper premolar (P<sup>2</sup>) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P<sup>3</sup>). Unlike mouse lemurs and more like dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs have a prominent [[Anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|anterior]] lower premolar (P<sub>2</sub>). Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M<sup>1\u20132</sup>) have a more anterior [[Molar (tooth)|hypocone]] that sits opposite the [[Molar (tooth)|metacone]], compared to the mouse lemurs' more [[Anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|posterior]] hypocone, which is presumably a [[Symplesiomorphy|symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait]].{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Also on M<sup>1</sup> and M<sup>2</sup>, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small [[Cusp (anatomy)|cuspules]].{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}} In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs have two pairs of [[Mammary gland|mammae]], one on the chest (pectoral) and one on the [[abdomen]] (abdominal).{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=128}} Their fur is typically grayish-brown on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] (back) side and more gray in color on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] (front) side.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=18}} The tail is typically black-tipped.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs.

Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees, while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height. Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}} and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal [[torpor]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}\n\n===Nesting===\nBoth species sleep in round nests up to {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across made of interlaced [[liana]]s, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and hands. Nests are typically between {{convert|2|and|10|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year-round leaf cover (e.g. [[Euphorbiaceae]]) are favored for nest construction, though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} In addition to nesting in dense lianas, individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12&nbsp;nests every few days to avoid predators.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Only females have been observed building nests in the wild,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} though males, females, and young have been observed building nests in captivity.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}}\n\n===Social structure===\nBoth species usually are solitary foragers,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=170}} although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=170\u2013171}} whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}} Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to [[Telemetry|radio-tracking]] and direct observations at [[Analabe]] near Kirindy, they form [[pair bond]]s,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other [[agonistic behavior]], and only rarely [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like \"hum\" or a \"hein\" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A \"mother-infant meeting call\" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like \"pfiou\" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a \"croak\", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated \"tisk-tisk-tisk\" sounds.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=108}} Females exhibit a \"waking call sequence\",{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} sometimes referred to as \"loud calls\", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter \"hon\" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} A long \"sexual call sequence\" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse \"brroak\" calls is used by both sexes during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]] on small branches and other objects.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Taking measurements of a male Mirza zaza.JPG|thumb|right|Measurements are taken on a northern giant mouse lemur of its testicle size, which relative to its body size is the largest among living primates.|alt=Male northern giant mouse lemur being held while calipers are used to measure its testicle size.]]\nReproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} the estrous cycle runs approximately 22&nbsp;days, while estrus lasts only a day or less.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the [[aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') and the [[red-bellied lemur]] (''Eulemur rubriventer'').{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}}\n\nOne to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90&nbsp;days of [[gestation]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} weighing approximately {{convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Because they are poorly developed, they initially remain in their mother's nest for up to three weeks, being transported by mouth between nests.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} Once they have grown sufficiently, typically after three weeks, the mother will park her offspring in vegetation while she forages nearby.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} After a month, the young begin to participate in social play and grooming with their mother, and between the first and second month, young males begin to exhibit early sexual behaviors (including mounting, neck biting, and pelvic thrusting).{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} By the third month, the young forage independently, though they maintain vocal contact with their mother{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} and use a small part of her range.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}}\n\nFemales start reproducing after ten months, while males develop functional testicles by their second mating season.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Testicle size in the northern giant mouse lemur does not appear to fluctuate by season,{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} and is so large relative to the animal's body mass that it is the highest among all [[primate]]s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} This emphasis on sperm production in males, as well as the use of [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], suggests a mating system best described as [[Polygynandry|polygynandrous]]{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} where males use [[scramble competition]] (roaming widely to find many females).{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} In contrast, male Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs appear to fight for access to females (contest competition) during their breeding season.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} Males disperse from their natal range, and the age at which they leave varies from two years to several. Females reproduce every year, although postpartum estrus has been observed in captivity. In the wild, the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} though in captivity they can live up to 15&nbsp;years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Madagascar buzzard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Madagascar buzzard sitting on a branch|The [[Madagascar buzzard]] preys on giant mouse lemurs.]]\nBoth species are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, [[Natural gum|tree gums]], large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} and eggs.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} after an individual was found with a half-eaten [[gray mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;murinus'') in a trap.{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|p=1222}} During June and July, at the peak of the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the [[larva]]e of [[hemiptera]]n and [[cochineal]] insects as well as tree gums.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on [[cashew]] fruits during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are often [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with mouse lemurs, such as ''M.&nbsp;murinus'', though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} At the [[Marosalaza]] forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages [[niche differentiation]] by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=115}}\n\n[[Diurnality|Diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as the [[Madagascar buzzard]] (''Buteo brachypterus'') are their most significant predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (''Cryptoprocta ferox''), [[Madagascar owl]] (''Asio madagascariensis''), and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]] (''Mungotictis decemlineata'').{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|pp=1222\u20131223}}\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2012, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) assessed both Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the northern giant mouse lemur as [[Endangered species|endangered]]. Prior to that, both species had been listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Populations of both species are in decline due to [[habitat destruction]], primarily for [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production. Also, they are both hunted for [[bushmeat]].{{R|IUCN_Mirza_coquereli|IUCN_Mirza_zaza}} The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62&nbsp;individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a [[captive breeding]] program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} from the region around Ambanja.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} As of 2009 the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} in 2015 only a single female remained on record.{{R|ISIS_Mirza_2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"WWF_25Mar2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |title=New population of rare giant-mouse lemurs found in Madagascar |date=25 March 2010 |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101100750/http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC_03Jul2015\">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=M. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Lemur found with giant testicles |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZphzXWDh?url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |archive-date=2015-07-07 |access-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_coquereli\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13584/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza coquereli'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_zaza\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136684/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza zaza'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ISIS_Mirza_2015\">{{cite report |title=Species holding report for: ''Mirza'' / Mouse lemur |year=2015 |publisher=[[International Species Information System]] (ISIS)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CITES\">{{cite web |url=http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Mirza |title=Checklist of CITES Species |website=CITES |publisher=UNEP-WCMC |accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Literature cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009}} -->{{cite book |last1=Beolens |first1=B. |last2=Watkins |first2=M. |last3=Grayson |first3=M. |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC |isbn=978-0-8018-9304-9 |oclc=270129903 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012}} -->{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=A.R. |last2=Zijlstra |first2=J.S. |last3=Groves |first3=C.P. |authorlink3=Colin Groves |title=Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 |url=http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf |journal=[[Lemur News]] |volume=16 |year=2012 |issn=1608-1439 |pages=64\u201370 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Fleagle|2013}} -->{{cite book |last1=Fleagle |first1=J.G. |authorlink1=John G.

Two [[species]] have been formally described; the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza zaza'') and [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''Mirza coquereli''). Like all other [[lemur]]s, they are native to [[Madagascar]], where they are found in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|western dry deciduous forests]] and further to the north in the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano Valley]] and [[Sahamalaza National Park|Sahamalaza Peninsula]]. First [[Species description|described]] in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with [[mouse lemur]]s and [[dwarf lemur]]s. In 1870, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] assigned them to their own genus, ''Mirza''. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within [[Cheirogaleidae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of small, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, [[Natural gum|tree gum]], insects, and small [[vertebrate]]s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of [[torpor]] during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form [[pair bond]]s. The northern species also has the largest [[testicle]] size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of [[Seasonal breeder|seasonally]]. [[Home range]]s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males [[Biological dispersal|disperse]]. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]].\n\nPredators of giant mouse lemurs include the [[Madagascar buzzard]], [[Madagascar owl]], [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]], and the [[narrow-striped mongoose]]. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day [[gestation]]. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under [[CITES|CITES Appendix I]], which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The [[Duke Lemur Center]] coordinated the [[captive breeding]] of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62&nbsp;individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Mirza coquereli 1868.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Artistic illustration of a giant mouse lemur climbing on a branch|The giant mouse lemur described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen|Pollen]] in 1868 (illustrated above) was considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the species described by [[Alfred Grandidier|Grandidier]] (1867), but was shown to be a distinct species in 2005.]]\nThe first species of giant mouse lemur was [[Species description|described]] by the French naturalist [[Alfred Grandidier]] in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near [[Morondava]] in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the [[Type (biology)#Lectotype|lectotype]] was selected in 1939 as MNHN&nbsp;1867\u2013603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist [[Charles Coquerel]],{{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009|pp=85\u201386}} Grandidier placed [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;coquereli'') with the [[dwarf lemur]]s in the [[genus]] ''Cheirogaleus'' (which he spelled ''Cheirogalus'') as ''C.&nbsp;coquereli''. He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with [[fork-marked lemur]]s (''Phaner''), which he considered to also be members of ''Cheirogaleus''. The following year, the German naturalist [[Hermann Schlegel]] and Dutch naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Pollen]] independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, ''coquereli'', basing theirs on an individual from around the [[Bay of Ampasindava]] in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s); however, these authors also listed all ''Cheirogaleus'' under ''Microcebus'' and based the classification of their species on similarities with the [[greater dwarf lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;typicus'', now ''C.&nbsp;major'').{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nIn 1870, the British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, ''Mirza''. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], [[Guillaume Grandidier]], and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=325}} British anatomist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to ''Cheirogaleus''), its first upper [[premolar]] was proportionally small as in ''Microcebus''.{{Sfn|Osman Hill|1953|p=333}} In 1977, French zoologist [[Jean-Jacques Petter]] also favored the ''Microcebus'' classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}\n\nThe genus ''Mirza'' was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]]{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} to represent an intermediate branch between ''Microcebus'' and ''Cheirogaleus'',{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}} citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest ''Microcebus'' and [[Animal locomotion|locomotor behavior]] more closely aligned with ''Cheirogaleus''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Adoption of ''Mirza'' was slow,{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'' by [[Conservation International]].{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}{{LoM1 Sfn|p=80}} In 1993, primatologist [[Colin Groves]] initially favored the ''Microcebus'' classification in the second edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'',{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but began supporting the resurrection of ''Mirza'' in 2001.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=70\u201371}} In 1991, prior to adopting ''Mirza'', Groves was the first to use the [[common name]] \"giant mouse lemur\". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as \"Coquerel's mouse lemur\".{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|p=67}}\n\nIn 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the [[northern giant mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;zaza'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} Their studies compared the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[Cytochrome b|mitochondrial cytochrome b]] [[Sequencing|sequences]] of specimens from both [[Kirindy Forest]] in central-western Madagascar and around [[Ambato, Madagascar|Ambato]] in northwestern Madagascar,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}} part of the [[Sambirano River|Sambirano valley]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=160}} Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, [[sociality]], and [[Reproduction|breeding]], as well as sufficient [[genetic distance]] to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}\n\nThe [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced in 2010 that a [[biodiversity]] study from 2009 in the [[gallery forest]] of [[Ranobe, Madagascar|Ranobe]] near [[Toliara]] in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed.

Gray often created mysterious and unexplained [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic names]]\u2014a trend continued with his description of not only ''Mirza'' in 1870, but also the genera ''Phaner'' (fork-marked lemurs) and ''Azema'' (for ''[[Brown mouse lemur|M.&nbsp;rufus]]'', now a synonym for ''Microcebus''), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]] attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For ''Mirza'', Palmer only noted that it derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] title [[Mirza|m\u00eerz\u00e2]] (\"prince\"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel ''et al.'' also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], which premiered in London on 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.{{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===Evolution===\nBased on studies using morphology, [[immunology]], [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]], [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINE]] analysis, [[Locus (genetics)|multilocus]] phylogenetic tests,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}} and [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genes]] (mtDNA),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a [[Cladistics|clade]] with the [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] (''Allocebus''). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} with fork-marked lemurs being either a [[sister group]] of all cheirogaleids,{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|p=1626}}{{Sfn|Roos|Schmitz|Zischler|2004|p=10653}} or more closely related to [[sportive lemur]]s (''Lepilemur'').{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}}\n\nAlthough ''Mirza'', ''Microcebus'', and ''Allocebus'' form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, the three lineages are thought to have [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Smith|Chan|Biebouw|2012|pp=1627\u20131628}} All three are thought to have diverged at least 20&nbsp;[[myr|mya]] (million years ago),{{Sfn|Masters|Silvestro|G\u00e9nin|DelPero|2013|p=209}} although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between ''Mirza'' and ''Microcebus'' at 24.2&nbsp;mya.

Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M<sup>1\u20132</sup>) have a more anterior [[Molar (tooth)|hypocone]] that sits opposite the [[Molar (tooth)|metacone]], compared to the mouse lemurs' more [[Anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|posterior]] hypocone, which is presumably a [[Symplesiomorphy|symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait]].{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Also on M<sup>1</sup> and M<sup>2</sup>, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small [[Cusp (anatomy)|cuspules]].{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=70}} In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs have two pairs of [[Mammary gland|mammae]], one on the chest (pectoral) and one on the [[abdomen]] (abdominal).{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=128}} Their fur is typically grayish-brown on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] (back) side and more gray in color on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] (front) side.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=18}} The tail is typically black-tipped.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs.

Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] (DLC) in [[Durham, North Carolina]] during the 1990s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}}\n\n===Population density and territory===\nBefore the recognition of more than one species, differences in [[population density]] were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near [[Ambanja]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=168\u2013170}} The former range between 30 and 210&nbsp;individuals per square kilometer (250&nbsp;acres),{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} with lower densities in open areas of the forest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086&nbsp;individuals per km<sup>2</sup>. However, in the case of the northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of [[Introduced species|introduced]] cashew and [[mango]] help sustain these higher populations.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=168\u2013170}}\n\nAccording to studies of Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, [[home range]]s of both sexes vary from {{convert|1|to|4|ha|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} with frequent overlap,{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} particularly on the periphery of their range.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=46}} Individuals most heavily use and aggressively defend a smaller core area within their range.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=46}} Individuals can have up to eight neighbors.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Home ranges of males tend to overlap with those of both females and other males,{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} and typically expand to four times the size during the mating season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Female home ranges show no variability in size, and can remain stable for years. At Kirindy Forest, genetic studies showed that the home ranges of related females tend to clump closely together, while unrelated males may overlap their range, suggesting male [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and migration is responsible for [[gene flow]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}\n\n===Activity patterns===\nBoth species are strictly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} leaving their nests around sunset to stretch and [[Personal grooming|self-groom]] for a few minutes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Both species typically forage between {{convert|5|and|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the forest floor, though Coquerel's giant mouse lemur has been observed on the ground.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} They primarily move by [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] running and occasionally leaping between branches, and use the same feeding postures as mouse lemurs, such as clinging to tree trunks.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} When moving through the trees, giant mouse lemurs scurry rapidly like mouse lemurs, unlike dwarf lemurs, which use more deliberate movement.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=127}} Slow movements are usually seen in lower, denser foliage when hunting for insects, while more rapid motion and leaping is typically seen at moderate heights of {{convert|2|\u2013|5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees, while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height. Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=102}} and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal [[torpor]].{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}\n\n===Nesting===\nBoth species sleep in round nests up to {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across made of interlaced [[liana]]s, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and hands. Nests are typically between {{convert|2|and|10|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year-round leaf cover (e.g. [[Euphorbiaceae]]) are favored for nest construction, though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} In addition to nesting in dense lianas, individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12&nbsp;nests every few days to avoid predators.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} Only females have been observed building nests in the wild,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}} though males, females, and young have been observed building nests in captivity.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=101}} Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and the introduced [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''). Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|pp=1316\u20131317}}\n\n===Social structure===\nBoth species usually are solitary foragers,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=170}} although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest,{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|Razafimanantsoa|Walter|2005|p=3}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=170\u2013171}} whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=166}} Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to [[Telemetry|radio-tracking]] and direct observations at [[Analabe]] near Kirindy, they form [[pair bond]]s,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=165\u2013166}} However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other [[agonistic behavior]], and only rarely [[social grooming]].{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like \"hum\" or a \"hein\" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A \"mother-infant meeting call\" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like \"pfiou\" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a \"croak\", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated \"tisk-tisk-tisk\" sounds.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=108}} Females exhibit a \"waking call sequence\",{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} sometimes referred to as \"loud calls\", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter \"hon\" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} A long \"sexual call sequence\" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse \"brroak\" calls is used by both sexes during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].{{Sfn|Pages|1980|pp=108\u2013109}} Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}} Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}} they also [[Territory (animal)|scent mark]] using saliva, urine, and secretions from the [[Scent gland|anogenital scent gland]] on small branches and other objects.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1318}}\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Taking measurements of a male Mirza zaza.JPG|thumb|right|Measurements are taken on a northern giant mouse lemur of its testicle size, which relative to its body size is the largest among living primates.|alt=Male northern giant mouse lemur being held while calipers are used to measure its testicle size.]]\nReproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} the estrous cycle runs approximately 22&nbsp;days, while estrus lasts only a day or less.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the [[aye-aye]] (''Daubentonia madagascariensis'') and the [[red-bellied lemur]] (''Eulemur rubriventer'').{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}} but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}}\n\nOne to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90&nbsp;days of [[gestation]],{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} weighing approximately {{convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Because they are poorly developed, they initially remain in their mother's nest for up to three weeks, being transported by mouth between nests.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} Once they have grown sufficiently, typically after three weeks, the mother will park her offspring in vegetation while she forages nearby.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} After a month, the young begin to participate in social play and grooming with their mother, and between the first and second month, young males begin to exhibit early sexual behaviors (including mounting, neck biting, and pelvic thrusting).{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} By the third month, the young forage independently, though they maintain vocal contact with their mother{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}}{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}} and use a small part of her range.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=112}}\n\nFemales start reproducing after ten months, while males develop functional testicles by their second mating season.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} Testicle size in the northern giant mouse lemur does not appear to fluctuate by season,{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} and is so large relative to the animal's body mass that it is the highest among all [[primate]]s.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} This emphasis on sperm production in males, as well as the use of [[Mating plug|copulatory plugs]], suggests a mating system best described as [[Polygynandry|polygynandrous]]{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} where males use [[scramble competition]] (roaming widely to find many females).{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} In contrast, male Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs appear to fight for access to females (contest competition) during their breeding season.{{Sfn|Rode\u2010Margono|Nekaris|Kappeler|Schwitzer|2015}} Males disperse from their natal range, and the age at which they leave varies from two years to several. Females reproduce every year, although postpartum estrus has been observed in captivity. In the wild, the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}} though in captivity they can live up to 15&nbsp;years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=67}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Madagascar buzzard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Madagascar buzzard sitting on a branch|The [[Madagascar buzzard]] preys on giant mouse lemurs.]]\nBoth species are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, [[Natural gum|tree gums]], large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds,{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} and eggs.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} after an individual was found with a half-eaten [[gray mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;murinus'') in a trap.{{Sfn|Goodman|2003|p=1222}} During June and July, at the peak of the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the [[larva]]e of [[hemiptera]]n and [[cochineal]] insects as well as tree gums.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1317}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=98}} During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on [[cashew]] fruits during the dry season.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=171}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are often [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with mouse lemurs, such as ''M.&nbsp;murinus'', though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests.{{Sfn|Fleagle|2013|p=62}} At the [[Marosalaza]] forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages [[niche differentiation]] by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.{{Sfn|Pages|1980|p=115}}\n\n[[Diurnality|Diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as the [[Madagascar buzzard]] (''Buteo brachypterus'') are their most significant predators.

Prior to that, both species had been listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Populations of both species are in decline due to [[habitat destruction]], primarily for [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and [[charcoal]] production. Also, they are both hunted for [[bushmeat]].{{R|IUCN_Mirza_coquereli|IUCN_Mirza_zaza}} The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] for [[mining]] activities.{{r|WWF_25Mar2010}}\n\nAs with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \"Class A\" of the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would be given only for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under [[CITES#Appendix I|CITES Appendix I]], which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}}\n\nGiant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62&nbsp;individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a [[captive breeding]] program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982{{Sfn|Harcourt|1990|p=47}} from the region around Ambanja.{{Sfn|Kappeler|2003|p=1316}} As of 2009 the [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population;{{LoM3 Sfn|p=167}} in 2015 only a single female remained on record.{{R|ISIS_Mirza_2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"WWF_25Mar2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |title=New population of rare giant-mouse lemurs found in Madagascar |date=25 March 2010 |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] |accessdate=1 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101100750/http://www.wwf.mg/news.cfm?uNewsID=191725 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC_03Jul2015\">{{cite news |last=Walker |first=M. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Lemur found with giant testicles |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZphzXWDh?url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150703-lemur-discovered-with-huge-testes |archive-date=2015-07-07 |access-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_coquereli\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13584/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza coquereli'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN_Mirza_zaza\">{{cite iucn |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136684/0 |author=Andriaholinirina, N. |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=''Mirza zaza'' |access-date=12 December 2014|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ISIS_Mirza_2015\">{{cite report |title=Species holding report for: ''Mirza'' / Mouse lemur |year=2015 |publisher=[[International Species Information System]] (ISIS)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CITES\">{{cite web |url=http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Mirza |title=Checklist of CITES Species |website=CITES |publisher=UNEP-WCMC |accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Literature cited===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beolens|Watkins|Grayson|2009}} -->{{cite book |last1=Beolens |first1=B. |last2=Watkins |first2=M. |last3=Grayson |first3=M. |title=The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC |isbn=978-0-8018-9304-9 |oclc=270129903 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Dunkel|Zijlstra|Groves|2012}} -->{{cite journal |last1=Dunkel |first1=A.R. |last2=Zijlstra |first2=J.S. |last3=Groves |first3=C.P. |authorlink3=Colin Groves |title=Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 |url=http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf |journal=[[Lemur News]] |volume=16 |year=2012 |issn=1608-1439 |pages=64\u201370 |ref=harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Fleagle|2013}} -->{{cite book |last1=Fleagle |first1=J.G. |authorlink1=John G.

Tallahassee is home to two of Florida's major public universities, [[Florida State University]] and [[Florida A&M University]], as well as [[Tallahassee Community College]]. Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

It was held from Wednesday, November 1, to Wednesday, December 6, 1820. Taking place at the height of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the election saw incumbent [[Democratic-Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]] win re-election without a major opponent. It was the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|third]] and last United States presidential election in which a presidential candidate ran effectively unopposed. It was also the last election of a president from the Revolutionary generation.\n\nMonroe and Vice President [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] faced no opposition from other Democratic-Republicans in their quest for a second term. The Federalist Party had fielded a presidential candidate in each election since [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], but the party's already-waning popularity had declined further following the [[War of 1812]]. Although able to field [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|a nominee for vice president]], the Federalists could not put forward a presidential candidate, leaving Monroe without organized opposition.\n\nMonroe won every state and received all but one of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] received the only other electoral vote, which came from [[faithless elector]] [[William Plumer]]. Four different Federalists received electoral votes for vice president, but Tompkins won re-election by a large margin. No other post-[[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] presidential candidate has matched Monroe's share of the electoral vote, and Monroe and [[George Washington]] remain the only presidential candidates to run without any major opposition. Monroe's victory was the last of six straight victories by Virginians in presidential elections (Jefferson twice, Madison twice, and Monroe twice).\n\n== Background ==\nDespite the continuation of single party politics (known in this case as the [[Era of Good Feelings]]), serious issues emerged during the election in 1820. The nation had endured a widespread depression following the [[Panic of 1819]] and momentous disagreement about the extension of slavery into the territories was taking center stage. Nevertheless, James Monroe faced no opposition party or candidate in his re-election bid, although he did not receive  all of the electoral votes (see below).\n\nMassachusetts was entitled to 22 electoral votes in 1816, but cast only 15 in 1820 by reason of the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which made the region of [[Maine]], long part of Massachusetts, a free state to balance the pending admission of slave state Missouri. In addition, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi also cast one fewer electoral vote than they were entitled to, as one elector from each state died before the electoral meeting. Consequently, this meant that Mississippi cast only two votes, when any state is always entitled to a minimum of three.\n\nMississippi, Illinois, Alabama and Missouri participated in their first presidential election in 1820, Missouri with controversy, since it was not yet officially a state (see below). No new states would participate in American presidential elections until 1836, after the admission to the Union of Arkansas in 1836 and Michigan in 1837 (after the main voting, but before the counting of the electoral vote in Congress).<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h261.html Election of 1820]</ref>\n\n== Nominations ==\n=== Democratic-Republican Party nomination ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Tricolour Cockade.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican Party]]<big>'''Democratic-Republican Party Ticket, 1820'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[James Monroe|{{color|white|James Monroe}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[Daniel D.

Only 40 delegates attended, with few or no delegates from the large states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Rather than name the president with only a handful of votes, the caucus declined to make a formal nomination. [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] offered the following resolution: \"It is inexpedient, at this time, to proceed to the nomination of persons for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\" After debate, the resolution was unanimously adopted, and the meeting adjourned. President Monroe and Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins thus became de ''facto'' candidates for re-election.\n\nIn the run-up to the caucus, Tompkins made another run for his former post of [[Governor of New York]], leading to potential replacements being informally discussed among the party leadership. The matter was ultimately rendered moot when Tompkins lost the [[1820 New York gubernatorial election|election]] shortly before the nominating caucus took place, and though some within the party remained dissatisfied with Tompkins' performance as Vice President, the role was not considered important enough to be worth a formal nomination process after his ability to continue in the office was confirmed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+Informal Ballot\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!\n|-\n![[James Monroe]] !!40!!

Plumer cast his electoral ballot for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] John Quincy Adams. While legend has it this was to ensure that George Washington would remain the only American president unanimously chosen by the Electoral College, that was not Plumer's goal. In fact, Plumer simply thought that Monroe was a mediocre president and that Adams would be a better one.<ref>Turner (1955) p 253</ref> Plumer also refused to vote for Tompkins for Vice President as \"grossly intemperate\", not having \"that weight of character which his office requires,\" and \"because he grossly neglected his duty\" in his \"only\" official role as President of the Senate by being \"absent nearly three-fourths of the time\";<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Daniel_Tompkins.htm \"Daniel D. Tompkins, 6th Vice President (1817-1825)\"] United States Senate web site.</ref> Plumer instead voted for [[Richard Rush]].\n\nEven though every member of the Electoral College was pledged to Monroe, there were still a number of Federalist electors who voted for a Federalist vice president rather than Monroe's running mate Daniel D. Tompkins: those for [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|Richard Stockton]] came from [[Massachusetts]], while the entire [[Delaware]] delegation voted for [[Daniel Rodney]] for Vice President, and [[Robert Goodloe Harper]]'s vice presidential vote was cast by an elector from his home state of [[Maryland]]. In any case, these breaks in ranks were not enough to deny Tompkins a substantial electoral college victory.\n\nMonroe's share of the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|share of the electoral vote]] has not been exceeded by any candidate since, with the closest competition coming from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s landslide [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] victory. \n\nOnly Washington, who won the vote of each presidential elector in the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1789]] and [[1792 United States presidential election|1792]] presidential elections, can claim to have swept the Electoral College.\n\nWashington's campaigns took place prior to the 1804 ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] instituting the current system, where each member of the Electoral College casts one vote for president and one vote for vice president. \n\nUnder the original system, each elector cast two votes, with no distinction being made between the votes for president and for vice president. Thus, in both of his campaigns, this meant Washington won the maximum number of electoral votes possible for any candidate, as opposed to winning 50% of the total electoral votes cast.\n\n{{start U.S. vice presidential election box|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. vice presidential election box row|name=[[Daniel D.

It was held from Wednesday, November 1, to Wednesday, December 6, 1820. Taking place at the height of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the election saw incumbent [[Democratic-Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]] win re-election without a major opponent. It was the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|third]] and last United States presidential election in which a presidential candidate ran effectively unopposed. It was also the last election of a president from the Revolutionary generation.\n\nMonroe and Vice President [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] faced no opposition from other Democratic-Republicans in their quest for a second term. The Federalist Party had fielded a presidential candidate in each election since [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], but the party's already-waning popularity had declined further following the [[War of 1812]]. Although able to field [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|a nominee for vice president]], the Federalists could not put forward a presidential candidate, leaving Monroe without organized opposition.\n\nMonroe won every state and received all but one of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] received the only other electoral vote, which came from [[faithless elector]] [[William Plumer]]. Four different Federalists received electoral votes for vice president, but Tompkins won re-election by a large margin. No other post-[[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] presidential candidate has matched Monroe's share of the electoral vote, and Monroe and [[George Washington]] remain the only presidential candidates to run without any major opposition. Monroe's victory was the last of six straight victories by Virginians in presidential elections (Jefferson twice, Madison twice, and Monroe twice).\n\n== Background ==\nDespite the continuation of single party politics (known in this case as the [[Era of Good Feelings]]), serious issues emerged during the election in 1820. The nation had endured a widespread depression following the [[Panic of 1819]] and momentous disagreement about the extension of slavery into the territories was taking center stage. Nevertheless, James Monroe faced no opposition party or candidate in his re-election bid, although he did not receive  all of the electoral votes (see below).\n\nMassachusetts was entitled to 22 electoral votes in 1816, but cast only 15 in 1820 by reason of the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which made the region of [[Maine]], long part of Massachusetts, a free state to balance the pending admission of slave state Missouri. In addition, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi also cast one fewer electoral vote than they were entitled to, as one elector from each state died before the electoral meeting. Consequently, this meant that Mississippi cast only two votes, when any state is always entitled to a minimum of three.\n\nMississippi, Illinois, Alabama and Missouri participated in their first presidential election in 1820, Missouri with controversy, since it was not yet officially a state (see below). No new states would participate in American presidential elections until 1836, after the admission to the Union of Arkansas in 1836 and Michigan in 1837 (after the main voting, but before the counting of the electoral vote in Congress).<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h261.html Election of 1820]</ref>\n\n== Nominations ==\n=== Democratic-Republican Party nomination ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Tricolour Cockade.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican Party]]<big>'''Democratic-Republican Party Ticket, 1820'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[James Monroe|{{color|white|James Monroe}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[Daniel D.

Only 40 delegates attended, with few or no delegates from the large states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Rather than name the president with only a handful of votes, the caucus declined to make a formal nomination. [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] offered the following resolution: \"It is inexpedient, at this time, to proceed to the nomination of persons for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\" After debate, the resolution was unanimously adopted, and the meeting adjourned. President Monroe and Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins thus became de ''facto'' candidates for re-election.\n\nIn the run-up to the caucus, Tompkins made another run for his former post of [[Governor of New York]], leading to potential replacements being informally discussed among the party leadership. The matter was ultimately rendered moot when Tompkins lost the [[1820 New York gubernatorial election|election]] shortly before the nominating caucus took place, and though some within the party remained dissatisfied with Tompkins' performance as Vice President, the role was not considered important enough to be worth a formal nomination process after his ability to continue in the office was confirmed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+Informal Ballot\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!\n|-\n![[James Monroe]] !!40!!

Plumer cast his electoral ballot for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] John Quincy Adams. While legend has it this was to ensure that George Washington would remain the only American president unanimously chosen by the Electoral College, that was not Plumer's goal. In fact, Plumer simply thought that Monroe was a mediocre president and that Adams would be a better one.<ref>Turner (1955) p 253</ref> Plumer also refused to vote for Tompkins for Vice President as \"grossly intemperate\", not having \"that weight of character which his office requires,\" and \"because he grossly neglected his duty\" in his \"only\" official role as President of the Senate by being \"absent nearly three-fourths of the time\";<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Daniel_Tompkins.htm \"Daniel D. Tompkins, 6th Vice President (1817-1825)\"] United States Senate web site.</ref> Plumer instead voted for [[Richard Rush]].\n\nEven though every member of the Electoral College was pledged to Monroe, there were still a number of Federalist electors who voted for a Federalist vice president rather than Monroe's running mate Daniel D. Tompkins: those for [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|Richard Stockton]] came from [[Massachusetts]], while the entire [[Delaware]] delegation voted for [[Daniel Rodney]] for Vice President, and [[Robert Goodloe Harper]]'s vice presidential vote was cast by an elector from his home state of [[Maryland]]. In any case, these breaks in ranks were not enough to deny Tompkins a substantial electoral college victory.\n\nMonroe's share of the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|share of the electoral vote]] has not been exceeded by any candidate since, with the closest competition coming from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s landslide [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] victory. \n\nOnly Washington, who won the vote of each presidential elector in the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1789]] and [[1792 United States presidential election|1792]] presidential elections, can claim to have swept the Electoral College.\n\nWashington's campaigns took place prior to the 1804 ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] instituting the current system, where each member of the Electoral College casts one vote for president and one vote for vice president. \n\nUnder the original system, each elector cast two votes, with no distinction being made between the votes for president and for vice president. Thus, in both of his campaigns, this meant Washington won the maximum number of electoral votes possible for any candidate, as opposed to winning 50% of the total electoral votes cast.\n\n{{start U.S. vice presidential election box|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. vice presidential election box row|name=[[Daniel D.

They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the [[pecan]] in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n''C. ovata'' begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\n[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood.<ref name=eastern>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Elbert L.|title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1980|isbn=0-394-50760-6|p=353}}</ref> In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], his plantation in [[Tennessee]].

They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the [[pecan]] in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n''C. ovata'' begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\n[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood.<ref name=eastern>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Elbert L.|title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1980|isbn=0-394-50760-6|p=353}}</ref> In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], his plantation in [[Tennessee]]. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandaceae species have large taproots) and nut litter.\n\nHickory nuts were a food source for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/species/ovata/ovata.htm |last=Grauke |first=LJ |publisher=Texas A&M University, Department of Horticultural Science |title=Hickories: ''Carya ovata''|accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref> who used the kernel milk to make corn cakes and [[hominy]].<ref name=eastern/>\n\nShagbark hickory [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]] and for making the [[bow (weapon)|bows]] of Native Americans of the northern area.

''x'' dunbarii'' Sarg.). Shagbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the ''Carya'' species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut]], [[Carya laciniosa|shellbark]], and shagbark) have been described, though most are unproductive or have other flaws.
