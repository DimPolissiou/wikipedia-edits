Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Catterall |first1=Peter |title=The Making of Channel 4 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135018870}}<!--|accessdate=18 February 2016--></ref> the station is now owned and operated by [[Channel Four Television Corporation]], a public corporation of the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Channel 4 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/channel-4 |publisher=Gov.uk |accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref> which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. In 2010, Channel 4 extended service into Wales and became a UK-wide television channel.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Channel 4}}\n\n===Conception===\n{{main|Fourth UK television service}}\n\nBefore Channel 4 and S4C, Britain had three terrestrial television services: [[BBC One|BBC1]], [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The [[Broadcasting Act 1980]] began the process of adding a fourth; Channel 4 was formally created, along with its [[S4C|Welsh counterpart]], by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1982. After some months of test broadcasts, it began scheduled transmissions on 2 November 1982.\n\nThe notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in 1954 and its subsequent launch in 1955; the idea of an \"ITV2\" (which came in 1998) was long expected and pushed for. Indeed, television sets sold throughout the 1970s and early 1980s had a spare tuning button labelled \"ITV/IBA 2\". Throughout [[History of ITV|ITV's history]] and until Channel 4 finally became a reality, a perennial dialogue existed between the [[General Post Office|GPO]], [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]], the ITV companies and other interested parties, concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take. Most likely, politics had the biggest impact in leading to a delay of almost three decades before the second commercial channel became a reality.<ref name=\"tbsseefour\"/>\n\nOne clear benefit of the \"late arrival\" of the channel was that its frequency allocations at each transmitter had already been arranged in the early 1960s, when the launch of an ITV2 was highly anticipated.<ref name=\"tbsseefour\"/> This led to very good coverage across most of the country and few problems of interference with other UK-based transmissions; a stark contrast to the problems associated with [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s launch almost 15 years later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1231802.stm|title=Channel 5 turns four|last=BBC News|first=|date=March 30, 2001|work=BBC News|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Wales===\n{{Main|S4C}}\nAt the time the fourth service was being considered, a movement in Wales lobbied for the creation of dedicated service that would air Welsh-language programmes, then only catered for at \"off peak\" times on [[BBC Wales]] and [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]. The campaign was taken so seriously by [[Gwynfor Evans]], former president of [[Plaid Cymru]], that he threatened the government with a hunger strike were it not to honour the plans.<ref name=\"seefour_wales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/seefour/wales |title=A Channel for Wales |author=Dafydd Hancock |publisher=seefour by Electromusications |website=transdiffusion.org |date=11 September 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe result was that Channel 4 as seen by the rest of the United Kingdom would be replaced in Wales by [[S4C|Sianel Pedwar Cymru]] (S4C) (\"Channel Four Wales\"). Operated by [[S4C Authority|a specially created authority]], S4C would air programmes in Welsh made by HTV, the BBC and independent companies. Initially limited frequency space meant that Channel 4 could not be broadcast alongside S4C, though some Channel 4 programmes would be aired at less popular times on the Welsh variant; this practice continued until the closure of S4C's analogue transmissions in 2010, at which time S4C became a fully Welsh channel.\nWith this conversion of the [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] transmitter group in Wales to digital terrestrial broadcasting on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide television channel for the first time.\n\nSince then, carriage on digital [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial]] has introduced Channel 4 to Welsh homes where it is now universally available.\n\n===Launch and IBA control===\nThe first voice heard on Channel 4's opening day of Tuesday 2 November 1982 was that of [[continuity announcer]] [[Paul Coia]] who said:\n\n{{quote|Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you, welcome to Channel Four.<ref name=RTC42012>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Paul|title=Channel 4 turns 30: relive the first day on air|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-11-02/channel-4-turns-30-relive-the-first-day-on-air/|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2 November 2012|accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nFollowing the announcement, the channel headed into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, \"Fourscore\", written by [[Lord David Dundas|David Dundas]], which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', at 16:45 produced by [[Yorkshire Television]]. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was [[Richard Whiteley]] with [[Ted Moult]] being the second. The first woman on the channel, contrary to popular belief, was not Whiteley's ''Countdown'' co-host [[Carol Vorderman]] but a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary. Whiteley opened the show with the words:\n\n{{quote|As the countdown to a brand new channel ends, a brand new countdown begins.<ref name=RTC42012/>}}\n\nOn its first day, Channel 4 also broadcast soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', which often ran storylines thought to be controversial; this ran until 2003.\n\nAt its launch, Channel 4 committed itself to providing an alternative to the existing channels, an agenda in part set out by its remit which required the provision of programming to minority groups.\n\nIn step with its remit, the channel became well received both by minority groups and the arts and cultural worlds during this period, especially under founding chief executive [[Jeremy Isaacs]], where the channel gained a reputation for programmes on the contemporary arts. Channel 4 co-commissioned [[Robert Ashley]]'s ground-breaking television opera ''[[Perfect Lives]]'',<ref>[http://www.robertashley.org/operas/perfectlives.htm Robert Ashley-Perfect Lives<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> which it premiered over several episodes in 1984. The channel often did not receive mass audiences for much of this period, however, as might be expected for a station focusing on minority interest.\n\nChannel 4 also began the funding of independent films, such as the [[Merchant-Ivory]] [[docudrama]] ''[[The Courtesans of Bombay]]'', during this time.\n\nIn 1992, Channel 4 also faced its first libel case by [[Jani Allan]], a South African journalist, who objected to her representation in [[Nick Broomfield]]'s documentary ''[[The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/901342.stm |title=Victims of the 'silver fox' |accessdate=20 August 2007 |work=BBC News |date=29 August 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1993, the channel broadcast the [[Television film|direct-to-TV]] documentary film ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'', in which it displayed the dominant position of the [[Rede Globo]] television network, and discussed its influence, power and political connections in Brazil.\n\n===Channel Four Television Corporation===\n{{Main|Channel Four Television Corporation}}\n[[File:Multi coloured 4, 124 Horseferry Road, London.jpg|thumb|Channel 4 headquarters,<br>[[124 Horseferry Road]], London]]\n[[File:Construction work at the Majestyk, City Square, Leeds (23rd December 2018).jpg|thumb|right|In 2020 Channel 4 will move its headquarters into the redeveloped Majestic building on [[Leeds City Square|City Square]], [[Leeds]].]]\n\nAfter control of the station passed from the Channel Four Television Company to the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] in 1993, a shift in broadcasting style took place. Instead of aiming for the fringes of society, it began to focus on the edges of the mainstream, and the centre of the mass market itself.<ref>Debrett, Mary.

This new direction increased ratings and revenues.\n\nIn addition, the corporation launched a number of new television channels through its new [[Channel Four Television Corporation#4Ventures|4Ventures]] offshoot, including [[Film4]], [[At the Races]], [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and [[More4]].\n\nPartially in reaction to its new \"populist\" direction, the [[Communications Act 2003]] directed the channel to demonstrate innovation, experimentation and creativity, appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society, and to include programmes of an educational nature which exhibit a distinctive character.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nOn 31 December 2004, Channel 4 launched a new look and new idents in which the logo is disguised as different objects and the 4 can be seen in an angle.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] founder [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]], 2005 saw a change of direction for Channel 4's digital channels. Channel 4 made E4 [[free-to-air]] on [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital terrestrial television]], and launched a new free-to-air digital channel called More4. By October, Channel 4 had joined the Freeview consortium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225 |title=DTG News: ITV and Channel 4 confirm Freeview stakes |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219105350/http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225 |archive-date=19 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> By July 2006, Film4 had likewise become free-to-air and restarted broadcasting on digital terrestrial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 |title=CHANNEL4SALES: NEWS |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708233806/http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 |archivedate=8 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nVenturing into radio broadcasting, 2005 saw Channel 4 purchase 51% of shares in the now defunct [[Oneword]] radio station with UBC Media holding on to the remaining shares. New programmes such as the weekly, half-hour ''The Morning Report'' news programme were among some of the new content Channel 4 provided for the station, with the name [[#4radio|4Radio]] being used. As of early 2009, however, Channel 4's future involvement in radio remained uncertain.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the station celebrated its 25th birthday. It showed the first episode of ''Countdown'', an anniversary ''Countdown'' special, as well as [[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year#The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz|a special edition of ''The Big Fat Quiz'']] and using the original multicoloured 1982\u20131996 blocks logo on presentation and idents using the Fourscore jingle throughout the day.\n\nIn November 2009, Channel 4 launched a week of [[3D television]], broadcasting selected programmes each night using [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[ColorCode 3D]] technology. The accompanying 3D glasses were distributed through [[Sainsbury's]] supermarkets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/3d-week |title=3D Week \u2013 Channel 4<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 September 2015, Channel 4 revamped its presentation for a fifth time; the new branding downplayed the \"4\" logo from most on-air usage, in favour of using the shapes from the logo in various forms. Four new idents were filmed by [[Jonathan Glazer]], which featured the shapes in various real-world scenes depicting the \"discovery\" and \"origins\" of the shapes. The full logo was still occasionally used, but primarily for off-air marketing. Channel 4 also commissioned two new corporate typefaces, \"Chadwick\", and \"Horseferry\" (a variation of Chadwick with the aforementioned shapes incorporated into its letter forms), for use across promotional material and on-air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/september/channel-4-rebrands-with-help-from-jonathan-glazer-and-neville-brody/ |first=Eliza |last=Williams |date=30 September 2015 |title=Channel 4 rebrands, with help from Jonathan Glazer and Neville Brody |publisher=[[Creative Review]] |access-date=4 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424113200/https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/september/channel-4-rebrands-with-help-from-jonathan-glazer-and-neville-brody/ |archive-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/channel-4-ditches-signature-4-logo-in-brave-and-bizarre-rebrand-a6674156.html|title=Channel 4 ditches signature '4' logo in 'brave and bizarre' rebrand |accessdate=14 February 2017 |work=The Independent |first=Adam |last=Sherwin |date=1 October 2015}}</ref> On 31 October 2017, Channel 4 introduced a new series of idents continuing the theme, this time depicting the logo shapes as having formed an [[anthropomorphic]] \"giant\" character.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/channel-4-logo-becomes-c4-giant-in-quirky-new-idents/ |title=Channel 4 logo becomes \"C4 giant\" in quirky new idents |date=31 October 2017 |work=Creative Review |access-date=7 November 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nBefore [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|the digital switch-over]], Channel 4 raised concerns over how it might finance its public service obligations afterward.

In practice, however, these other activities are loss-making, and are subsidised by the main network. According to Channel 4's last published accounts, for 2005, the extent of this cross-subsidy was some \u00a330 million.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf 11419_11419_C4<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615192437/http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf |date=15 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe change in funding came about under the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] when the new corporation was afforded the ability to fund itself. Originally this arrangement left a \"safety net\" guaranteed minimum income should the revenue fall too low, funded by large insurance payments made to the ITV companies. Such a subsidy was never required, however, and these premiums were phased out by the government in 1998. After the link with ITV was cut, the cross-promotion which had existed between ITV and Channel 4 also ended.\n\nIn 2007, owing to severe funding difficulties, the channel sought government help and was granted a payment of \u00a314 million over a six-year period. The money was to have come from the television licence fee, and would have been the first time that money from the licence fee had been given to any broadcaster other than the BBC.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jowell-challenges-channel-4-to-justify-16314m-of-public-funding-454035.html |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Jowell challenges Channel 4 to justify \u00a314m of public funding |first=Ian |last=Burrell |date=21 June 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> However, the plan was scrapped by the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Andy Burnham]], ahead of \"broader decisions about the future framework of public service broadcasting\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7750501.stm |work=BBC News |title=Channel 4 switchover cash shelved |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> The broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] released its review in January 2009 in which it suggested that Channel 4 would preferably be funded by \"partnerships, joint ventures or mergers\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/psb2_phase2/statement/ |title=Ofcom's second Public Service Broadcasting Review \u2013 Phase Two: preparing for the digital future |website=Ofcom|date=22 September 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nChannel 4 is a \"publisher-broadcaster\", meaning that it commissions or \"buys\" all of its programming from companies independent of itself. It was the first broadcaster in the United Kingdom to do so on any significant scale; such commissioning is a stipulation which is included in its licence to broadcast.<ref name=\"schools\"/> This had the consequence of starting an industry of production companies that did not have to rely on owning an ITV licence to see their programmes air, though since Channel 4, external commissioning has become regular practice on the numerous stations that have launched since, as well as on the [[BBC]] and in ITV (where a quota of 25% minimum of total output has been imposed since the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] came into force). Although it was the first British broadcaster to commission all of its programmes from third parties, Channel 4 was the last terrestrial broadcaster to outsource its transmission and playout operations (to [[Red Bee Media]]), after 25 years in-house.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/14/channel4.television1 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Channel 4 outsources to Red Bee |first=Caitlin |last=Fitzsimmons |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe requirement to obtain all content externally is stipulated in its licence.<ref name=\"licence\"/> Additionally, Channel 4 also began a trend of owning the copyright and distribution rights of the programmes it aired, in a manner that is similar to the major Hollywood studios' ownership of television programmes that they did not directly produce.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Thus, although Channel 4 does not produce programmes, many are seen as belonging to it.\n\nIt was established with a specific intention of providing programming to groups of minority interests, not catered for by its competitors, which at the time were only the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=\"tbsseefour\">{{cite web |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/yes.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124205530/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/yes.php |archivedate=24 January 2007 |title=Yes it's no |author=Russ J Graham |website=transdiffusion.org |date=11 September 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nChannel 4 also pioneered the concept of 'stranded programming', where seasons of programmes following a common theme would be aired and promoted together. Some would be very specific, and run for a fixed period of time; the ''[[4 Mation]]'' season, for example, showed innovative animation. Other, less specific strands, were (and still are) run regularly, such as ''[[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'', a strand of programming aimed at teenagers, on weekend mornings (and weekdays during school/college holidays); ''Friday Night Comedy'', a slot where the channel would pioneer its style of comedy commissions, ''4Music'' (now a separate channel) and ''[[4Later]]'', an eclectic collection of offbeat programmes transmitted in the early hours of the morning.\n\nIn its earlier years, ''[[Red triangle (Channel 4)|Red Triangle]]'' was the name given to the airing of certain risqu\u00e9 art-house films due to the use of a red triangle [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the upper right of the screen, dubbed as being pornographic by many of Channel 4's critics, while general broadcasting of films on the station for many years came under the banner of ''Film on Four'' prior to the launch of the ''FilmFour'' brand and station in the late 1990s.\n\n=== Most watched programmes ===\nThe following is a list of the 10 most watched shows on Channel 4 since launch, based on Live +28 data supplied by [[BARB]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30 |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes |publisher=Barb.co.uk |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> and archival data published by Channel 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/media/documents/corporate/foi-docs/4_at_25.pdf |title=Top 50 Programmes on Channel 4 1982 \u2013 2007 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1993, the Channel 4 Schools idents featured famous people in one category, with light shining on them in front of an industrial looking setting supplemented by instrumental calming music. This changed in 1996 with the circles look to numerous children touching the screen, forming circles of information then picked up by other children. The last child would produce the channel 4 logo in the form of three vertical circles, with another in the middle and to the left containing the Channel 4 logo.\n\nA present feature of presentation was a countdown sequence featuring, in 1993 a slide with the programme name, and afterwards an extended sequence matching the channel branding. In 1996, this was an extended ident with timer in top left corner, and in 1999 following the adoption of the squares look, featured a square with timer slowly make its way across the right of the screen with people learning and having fun while doing so passing across the screen. It finished with the Channel 4 logo box on the right of the screen and the name 'Channel 4 Schools' being shown. This was adapted in 2000 when the service's name was changed to '4Learning'.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2001, this was altered to various scenes from classrooms around the world and different parts of school life. The countdown now flips over from the top, right, bottom and left with each second, and ends with four coloured squares, three of which are aligned vertically to the left of the Channel 4 logo, which is contained inside the fourth box. The tag 'Learning' is located directly beneath the logo. The final countdown sequence lasted between 2004 and 2005 and featured a background video of current controversial issues, overlaid with upcoming programming information. the video features people in the style of graffiti enacting the overuse of CCTV cameras, fox hunting, computer viruses and pirate videos, relationships, pollution of the seas and violent lifestyles.

Ranelagh's first major commission caused a furore, a three-part documentary series called ''[[Jesus: The Evidence]]''. The programmes, transmitted during the Easter period of 1984, seemed to advocate the idea that the Gospels were unreliable, Jesus may have indulged in witchcraft, and that he may not have even existed. The series triggered a public outcry, and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the UK's broadcasting and religious institutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Film ===\nNumerous genres of film-making \u2013 such as comedy, drama, documentary, adventure/action, romance and horror/thriller \u2013 are represented in the channel's schedule. From the launch of Channel 4 until 1998, film presentations on C4 would often be broadcast under the \"Film on Four\" banner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/840487/index.html |title=Channel 4 Films/Film on Four/FilmFour |website=BFI Screenonline |access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1304135/index.html |title=Channel 4 and Film |last=Brooke |first=Michael |website=BFI Screenonline |access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2005, Channel 4 screened the uncut [[Lars von Trier]] film ''[[The Idiots]]'', which includes unsimulated sexual intercourse, making it the first UK terrestrial channel to do so.

The Film4 channel carries a wide range of film productions, including acquired and Film4-produced projects.

The first show was about a [[Masturbate-a-thon]], a public mass masturbation event, organised to raise money for the [[sexual health]] charity [[Marie Stopes International]]. Another film would have focused on compulsive male masturbators and a third was to feature the [[sex education|sex educator]] Dr [[Betty Dodson]].\n\nThe series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4 |title=Channel 4 postpones 'wank week' programming |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n=== Global warming ===\nOn 8 March 2007, Channel 4 screened a highly controversial documentary, ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]''.

These four sites include features, profiles and interviews in text, audio and video formats, divided into five zones: TV, Film, Radio, New Media and Extras, which covers other arts such as theatre, music and design. 4Talent also collates networking, showcasing and professional development opportunities, and runs workshops, masterclasses, seminars and showcasing events across the UK.\n\n==== ''4Talent Magazine'' ====\n''4Talent magazine'' is the creative industries magazine from 4Talent, which launched in 2005 as TEN4 magazine under the editorship of Dan Jones. ''4Talent Magazine'' is currently edited by Nick Carson. Other staff include deputy editor Catherine Bray and production editor Helen Byrne. The magazine covers rising and established figures of interest in the creative industries, a remit including film, radio, TV, comedy, music, new media and design.\n\nSubjects are usually UK-based, with contributing editors based in Northern Ireland, Scotland, London and Birmingham, but the publication has been known to source international content from Australia, America, continental Europe and the Middle East. The magazine is frequently organised around a theme for the issue, for instance giving half of November 2007's pages over to profiling winners of the annual 4Talent Awards.\n\nAn unusual feature of the magazine's credits is the equal prominence given to the names of writers, photographers, designers and illustrators, contradicting standard industry practice of more prominent writer bylines. It is also recognisable for its 'wraparound' covers, which use the front and back as a continuous canvas \u2013 often produced by guest artists.\n\nAlthough ''4Talent Magazine'' is technically a newsstand title, a significant proportion of its readers are subscribers. It started life as a quarterly 100-page title, but has since doubled in size and is now published bi-annually.\n\n==Presentation==\nSince its launch in 1982, Channel 4 has used the same logo which consists of a stylised numeral \"4\" made up of nine differently shaped blocks. The logo was designed by [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]] and his brother Robinson and was the first channel in the UK to depict an ident made using advanced computer generation (the first electronically generated ident was on [[BBC Two]] [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|in 1979,]] but this was two-dimensional). It was designed in conjunction with Bo Gehring Aviation of Los Angeles and originally depicted the \"4\" in red, yellow, green, blue and purple. The music accompanying the ident was called \"Fourscore\" and was composed by David Dundas; it was later released as a single alongside a B-side, \"Fourscore Two\", although neither reached the UK charts. In November 1992, \"Fourscore\" was replaced by new music.\n\nIn 1996, Channel 4 commissioned Tomato Films to revamp the \"4\", which resulted in the \"Circles\" idents showing four white circles forming up transparently over various scenes, with the \"4\" logo depicted in white in one of the circles.\n\nIn 1999, Spin redesigned the logo to feature in a single square which sat on the right-hand side of the screen, whilst various stripes would move along from left to right, often lighting the squared \"4\" up. Like previous \"Circles\" idents from 1996 (which was made by Tomato Films), the stripes would be interspersed with various scenes potentially related to the upcoming programme.\n\nThe logo was made three-dimensional again in 2004 when it was depicted in filmed scenes that show the blocks forming the \"4\" logo for less than a second before the action moves away again.\n\nIn 2015, the logo was disassembled completely to allow the blocks to appear as parts of a nature scene, sometimes featuring a strange dancing creature and sometimes being excavated for scientific study, one being studied under a microscope and showing a [[tardigrade]]. The second wave of these idents, launched in 2017, depict a giant creature made of the \"4\" blocks (made to look almost like a person) interacting with everyday life, sometimes shouting the \"Fourscore\" theme as a foghorn.\n\n==On-air identity==\n<gallery>\nFile:Channel 4 logo 1982.svg|Channel 4 logo from 1982 to 1996.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 1996.svg|Channel 4 logo from 1996 to 1999.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 1999.svg|Channel 4 logo from 1999 to 2004.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 2004.svg|Channel 4 logo from 2004 to 2015.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 2015.svg|Channel 4 logo from 2015.\n</gallery>\n\n==Regions/International ==\nChannel 4 has, since its inception, broadcast identical programmes and [[continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] throughout the United Kingdom (excluding Wales where it did not operate on analogue transmitters). At launch this made it unique, as both the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had long established traditions of providing [[regional variations]] in their programming in different areas of the country. Since the launch of subsequent British television channels, Channel 4 has become typical in its lack of regional programming variations.\n\nA few exceptions exist to this rule for programming and continuity:\n\nSome of Channel 4's schools' programming (1980s/early '90s) was regionalised due to differences in curricula between different regions.<ref name=\"itvschools\"/>\n\nPart of Channel 4's remit covers the commissioning of programmes from outside London. Channel 4 has a dedicated director of nations and regions, [[Stuart Cosgrove]], who is based in a regional office in Glasgow. As his job title suggests, it is his responsibility to foster relations with independent producers based in areas of the United Kingdom (including Wales) outside London.\n\nAdvertising on Channel 4 does contain regular variation: prior to 1993, when ITV was responsible for selling Channel 4's advertising, each regional ITV company would provide the content of advertising breaks, covering the same transmitter area as themselves, and these breaks were often unique to that area. After Channel 4 became responsible for its own advertising, it continued to offer advertisers the ability to target particular audiences and divided its coverage area into six regions: London, South,  Midlands, North, Northern Ireland and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map|title=Channel 4's 'Macro Regions' for advertising, including a map |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220084700/http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAt present, Wales does not have its own advertising region, instead its viewers receive the southern region on digital platforms intentionally broadcast to the area, or the neighbouring region where terrestrial transmissions spill over into Wales. The Republic of Ireland shares its advertising region with Northern Ireland (referred to by Channel 4 as the 'Ulster Macro') with many advertisers selling products for Ireland here.<ref name=\"foursales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |title=Channel 4's Dublin Sales Office |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527224137/http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}</ref> [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] has an advertising variant for Ireland, although Northern Ireland receives the UK version of E4.<ref name=\"foursales\"/> The six regions are also carried on satellite, cable and Digital Terrestrial.\n\n[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[ITV Breakfast]] use a similar model to Channel 4 for providing their own advertising regions, despite also having a single national output of programming.\n\nDespite the Republic of Ireland not being in the UK, Channel 4 has a dedicated variant broadcast on Sky Ireland which omits programmes for which broadcast rights are not held in Ireland. For example, the series [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']] is not available on Channel 4 on Sky in Ireland. In recent years a Republic of Ireland advertising opt-out has been added to this version.\n\n===Future possibility of regional news===\nWith [[ITV plc]] pushing for much looser requirements on the amount of regional news and other programming it is obliged to broadcast in its ITV regions, the idea of Channel 4 taking on a regional news commitment has been considered, with the corporation in talks with [[Ofcom]] and ITV over the matter.<ref name=\"c4moveregional\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/03/channel4.ofcom |title=Channel 4 ponders move into regional news as ITV retreats |work=The Guardian |author=Leigh Holmwood |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2008 |location=London}}</ref> Channel 4 believe that a scaling-back of such operations on ITV's part would be detrimental to Channel 4's national news operation, which shares much of its resources with ITV through their shared news contractor [[ITN]].

Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Catterall |first1=Peter |title=The Making of Channel 4 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135018870}}<!--|accessdate=18 February 2016--></ref> the station is now owned and operated by [[Channel Four Television Corporation]], a public corporation of the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Channel 4 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/channel-4 |publisher=Gov.uk |accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref> which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. In 2010, Channel 4 extended service into Wales and became a UK-wide television channel.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Channel 4}}\n\n===Conception===\n{{main|Fourth UK television service}}\n\nBefore Channel 4 and S4C, Britain had three terrestrial television services: [[BBC One|BBC1]], [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The [[Broadcasting Act 1980]] began the process of adding a fourth; Channel 4 was formally created, along with its [[S4C|Welsh counterpart]], by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1982. After some months of test broadcasts, it began scheduled transmissions on 2 November 1982.\n\nThe notion of a second commercial broadcaster in the United Kingdom had been around since the inception of ITV in 1954 and its subsequent launch in 1955; the idea of an \"ITV2\" (which came in 1998) was long expected and pushed for. Indeed, television sets sold throughout the 1970s and early 1980s had a spare tuning button labelled \"ITV/IBA 2\". Throughout [[History of ITV|ITV's history]] and until Channel 4 finally became a reality, a perennial dialogue existed between the [[General Post Office|GPO]], [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]], the ITV companies and other interested parties, concerning the form such an expansion of commercial broadcasting would take. Most likely, politics had the biggest impact in leading to a delay of almost three decades before the second commercial channel became a reality.<ref name=\"tbsseefour\"/>\n\nOne clear benefit of the \"late arrival\" of the channel was that its frequency allocations at each transmitter had already been arranged in the early 1960s, when the launch of an ITV2 was highly anticipated.<ref name=\"tbsseefour\"/> This led to very good coverage across most of the country and few problems of interference with other UK-based transmissions; a stark contrast to the problems associated with [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s launch almost 15 years later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1231802.stm|title=Channel 5 turns four|last=BBC News|first=|date=March 30, 2001|work=BBC News|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Wales===\n{{Main|S4C}}\nAt the time the fourth service was being considered, a movement in Wales lobbied for the creation of dedicated service that would air Welsh-language programmes, then only catered for at \"off peak\" times on [[BBC Wales]] and [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]]. The campaign was taken so seriously by [[Gwynfor Evans]], former president of [[Plaid Cymru]], that he threatened the government with a hunger strike were it not to honour the plans.<ref name=\"seefour_wales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/seefour/wales |title=A Channel for Wales |author=Dafydd Hancock |publisher=seefour by Electromusications |website=transdiffusion.org |date=11 September 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe result was that Channel 4 as seen by the rest of the United Kingdom would be replaced in Wales by [[S4C|Sianel Pedwar Cymru]] (S4C) (\"Channel Four Wales\"). Operated by [[S4C Authority|a specially created authority]], S4C would air programmes in Welsh made by HTV, the BBC and independent companies. Initially limited frequency space meant that Channel 4 could not be broadcast alongside S4C, though some Channel 4 programmes would be aired at less popular times on the Welsh variant; this practice continued until the closure of S4C's analogue transmissions in 2010, at which time S4C became a fully Welsh channel.\nWith this conversion of the [[Wenvoe transmitting station|Wenvoe]] transmitter group in Wales to digital terrestrial broadcasting on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide television channel for the first time.\n\nSince then, carriage on digital [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial]] has introduced Channel 4 to Welsh homes where it is now universally available.\n\n===Launch and IBA control===\nThe first voice heard on Channel 4's opening day of Tuesday 2 November 1982 was that of [[continuity announcer]] [[Paul Coia]] who said:\n\n{{quote|Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you, welcome to Channel Four.<ref name=RTC42012>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Paul|title=Channel 4 turns 30: relive the first day on air|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-11-02/channel-4-turns-30-relive-the-first-day-on-air/|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2 November 2012|accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nFollowing the announcement, the channel headed into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, \"Fourscore\", written by [[Lord David Dundas|David Dundas]], which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', at 16:45 produced by [[Yorkshire Television]]. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was [[Richard Whiteley]] with [[Ted Moult]] being the second. The first woman on the channel, contrary to popular belief, was not Whiteley's ''Countdown'' co-host [[Carol Vorderman]] but a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary. Whiteley opened the show with the words:\n\n{{quote|As the countdown to a brand new channel ends, a brand new countdown begins.<ref name=RTC42012/>}}\n\nOn its first day, Channel 4 also broadcast soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'', which often ran storylines thought to be controversial; this ran until 2003.\n\nAt its launch, Channel 4 committed itself to providing an alternative to the existing channels, an agenda in part set out by its remit which required the provision of programming to minority groups.\n\nIn step with its remit, the channel became well received both by minority groups and the arts and cultural worlds during this period, especially under founding chief executive [[Jeremy Isaacs]], where the channel gained a reputation for programmes on the contemporary arts. Channel 4 co-commissioned [[Robert Ashley]]'s ground-breaking television opera ''[[Perfect Lives]]'',<ref>[http://www.robertashley.org/operas/perfectlives.htm Robert Ashley-Perfect Lives<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> which it premiered over several episodes in 1984. The channel often did not receive mass audiences for much of this period, however, as might be expected for a station focusing on minority interest.\n\nChannel 4 also began the funding of independent films, such as the [[Merchant-Ivory]] [[docudrama]] ''[[The Courtesans of Bombay]]'', during this time.\n\nIn 1992, Channel 4 also faced its first libel case by [[Jani Allan]], a South African journalist, who objected to her representation in [[Nick Broomfield]]'s documentary ''[[The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/901342.stm |title=Victims of the 'silver fox' |accessdate=20 August 2007 |work=BBC News |date=29 August 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1993, the channel broadcast the [[Television film|direct-to-TV]] documentary film ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'', in which it displayed the dominant position of the [[Rede Globo]] television network, and discussed its influence, power and political connections in Brazil.\n\n===Channel Four Television Corporation===\n{{Main|Channel Four Television Corporation}}\n[[File:Multi coloured 4, 124 Horseferry Road, London.jpg|thumb|Channel 4 headquarters,<br>[[124 Horseferry Road]], London]]\n[[File:Construction work at the Majestyk, City Square, Leeds (23rd December 2018).jpg|thumb|right|In 2020 Channel 4 will move its headquarters into the redeveloped Majestic building on [[Leeds City Square|City Square]], [[Leeds]].]]\n\nAfter control of the station passed from the Channel Four Television Company to the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] in 1993, a shift in broadcasting style took place. Instead of aiming for the fringes of society, it began to focus on the edges of the mainstream, and the centre of the mass market itself.<ref>Debrett, Mary.

This new direction increased ratings and revenues.\n\nIn addition, the corporation launched a number of new television channels through its new [[Channel Four Television Corporation#4Ventures|4Ventures]] offshoot, including [[Film4]], [[At the Races]], [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] and [[More4]].\n\nPartially in reaction to its new \"populist\" direction, the [[Communications Act 2003]] directed the channel to demonstrate innovation, experimentation and creativity, appeal to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society, and to include programmes of an educational nature which exhibit a distinctive character.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nOn 31 December 2004, Channel 4 launched a new look and new idents in which the logo is disguised as different objects and the 4 can be seen in an angle.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] founder [[Andy Duncan (executive)|Andy Duncan]], 2005 saw a change of direction for Channel 4's digital channels. Channel 4 made E4 [[free-to-air]] on [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital terrestrial television]], and launched a new free-to-air digital channel called More4. By October, Channel 4 had joined the Freeview consortium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225 |title=DTG News: ITV and Channel 4 confirm Freeview stakes |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219105350/http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=1225 |archive-date=19 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> By July 2006, Film4 had likewise become free-to-air and restarted broadcasting on digital terrestrial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 |title=CHANNEL4SALES: NEWS |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708233806/http://www.channel4sales.com/news/news-article.aspx?year=2006&id=21 |archivedate=8 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nVenturing into radio broadcasting, 2005 saw Channel 4 purchase 51% of shares in the now defunct [[Oneword]] radio station with UBC Media holding on to the remaining shares. New programmes such as the weekly, half-hour ''The Morning Report'' news programme were among some of the new content Channel 4 provided for the station, with the name [[#4radio|4Radio]] being used. As of early 2009, however, Channel 4's future involvement in radio remained uncertain.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the station celebrated its 25th birthday. It showed the first episode of ''Countdown'', an anniversary ''Countdown'' special, as well as [[The Big Fat Quiz of the Year#The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz|a special edition of ''The Big Fat Quiz'']] and using the original multicoloured 1982\u20131996 blocks logo on presentation and idents using the Fourscore jingle throughout the day.\n\nIn November 2009, Channel 4 launched a week of [[3D television]], broadcasting selected programmes each night using [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[ColorCode 3D]] technology.

Four new idents were filmed by [[Jonathan Glazer]], which featured the shapes in various real-world scenes depicting the \"discovery\" and \"origins\" of the shapes. The full logo was still occasionally used, but primarily for off-air marketing. Channel 4 also commissioned two new corporate typefaces, \"Chadwick\", and \"Horseferry\" (a variation of Chadwick with the aforementioned shapes incorporated into its letter forms), for use across promotional material and on-air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/september/channel-4-rebrands-with-help-from-jonathan-glazer-and-neville-brody/ |first=Eliza |last=Williams |date=30 September 2015 |title=Channel 4 rebrands, with help from Jonathan Glazer and Neville Brody |publisher=[[Creative Review]] |access-date=4 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424113200/https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/september/channel-4-rebrands-with-help-from-jonathan-glazer-and-neville-brody/ |archive-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/channel-4-ditches-signature-4-logo-in-brave-and-bizarre-rebrand-a6674156.html|title=Channel 4 ditches signature '4' logo in 'brave and bizarre' rebrand |accessdate=14 February 2017 |work=The Independent |first=Adam |last=Sherwin |date=1 October 2015}}</ref> On 31 October 2017, Channel 4 introduced a new series of idents continuing the theme, this time depicting the logo shapes as having formed an [[anthropomorphic]] \"giant\" character.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/channel-4-logo-becomes-c4-giant-in-quirky-new-idents/ |title=Channel 4 logo becomes \"C4 giant\" in quirky new idents |date=31 October 2017 |work=Creative Review |access-date=7 November 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nBefore [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|the digital switch-over]], Channel 4 raised concerns over how it might finance its public service obligations afterward.

In practice, however, these other activities are loss-making, and are subsidised by the main network. According to Channel 4's last published accounts, for 2005, the extent of this cross-subsidy was some \u00a330 million.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf 11419_11419_C4<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615192437/http://www.channel4.com/about4/pdf/2005_C4_Complete.pdf |date=15 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe change in funding came about under the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] when the new corporation was afforded the ability to fund itself. Originally this arrangement left a \"safety net\" guaranteed minimum income should the revenue fall too low, funded by large insurance payments made to the ITV companies. Such a subsidy was never required, however, and these premiums were phased out by the government in 1998. After the link with ITV was cut, the cross-promotion which had existed between ITV and Channel 4 also ended.\n\nIn 2007, owing to severe funding difficulties, the channel sought government help and was granted a payment of \u00a314 million over a six-year period. The money was to have come from the television licence fee, and would have been the first time that money from the licence fee had been given to any broadcaster other than the BBC.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jowell-challenges-channel-4-to-justify-16314m-of-public-funding-454035.html |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Jowell challenges Channel 4 to justify \u00a314m of public funding |first=Ian |last=Burrell |date=21 June 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> However, the plan was scrapped by the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Andy Burnham]], ahead of \"broader decisions about the future framework of public service broadcasting\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7750501.stm |work=BBC News |title=Channel 4 switchover cash shelved |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> The broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]] released its review in January 2009 in which it suggested that Channel 4 would preferably be funded by \"partnerships, joint ventures or mergers\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/psb2_phase2/statement/ |title=Ofcom's second Public Service Broadcasting Review \u2013 Phase Two: preparing for the digital future |website=Ofcom|date=22 September 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nChannel 4 is a \"publisher-broadcaster\", meaning that it commissions or \"buys\" all of its programming from companies independent of itself. It was the first broadcaster in the United Kingdom to do so on any significant scale; such commissioning is a stipulation which is included in its licence to broadcast.<ref name=\"schools\"/> This had the consequence of starting an industry of production companies that did not have to rely on owning an ITV licence to see their programmes air, though since Channel 4, external commissioning has become regular practice on the numerous stations that have launched since, as well as on the [[BBC]] and in ITV (where a quota of 25% minimum of total output has been imposed since the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] came into force). Although it was the first British broadcaster to commission all of its programmes from third parties, Channel 4 was the last terrestrial broadcaster to outsource its transmission and playout operations (to [[Red Bee Media]]), after 25 years in-house.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/14/channel4.television1 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Channel 4 outsources to Red Bee |first=Caitlin |last=Fitzsimmons |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe requirement to obtain all content externally is stipulated in its licence.<ref name=\"licence\"/> Additionally, Channel 4 also began a trend of owning the copyright and distribution rights of the programmes it aired, in a manner that is similar to the major Hollywood studios' ownership of television programmes that they did not directly produce.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Thus, although Channel 4 does not produce programmes, many are seen as belonging to it.\n\nIt was established with a specific intention of providing programming to groups of minority interests, not catered for by its competitors, which at the time were only the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=\"tbsseefour\">{{cite web |url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/yes.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124205530/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/yes.php |archivedate=24 January 2007 |title=Yes it's no |author=Russ J Graham |website=transdiffusion.org |date=11 September 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nChannel 4 also pioneered the concept of 'stranded programming', where seasons of programmes following a common theme would be aired and promoted together. Some would be very specific, and run for a fixed period of time; the ''[[4 Mation]]'' season, for example, showed innovative animation. Other, less specific strands, were (and still are) run regularly, such as ''[[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'', a strand of programming aimed at teenagers, on weekend mornings (and weekdays during school/college holidays); ''Friday Night Comedy'', a slot where the channel would pioneer its style of comedy commissions, ''4Music'' (now a separate channel) and ''[[4Later]]'', an eclectic collection of offbeat programmes transmitted in the early hours of the morning.\n\nIn its earlier years, ''[[Red triangle (Channel 4)|Red Triangle]]'' was the name given to the airing of certain risqu\u00e9 art-house films due to the use of a red triangle [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the upper right of the screen, dubbed as being pornographic by many of Channel 4's critics, while general broadcasting of films on the station for many years came under the banner of ''Film on Four'' prior to the launch of the ''FilmFour'' brand and station in the late 1990s.\n\n=== Most watched programmes ===\nThe following is a list of the 10 most watched shows on Channel 4 since launch, based on Live +28 data supplied by [[BARB]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30 |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes |publisher=Barb.co.uk |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> and archival data published by Channel 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/media/documents/corporate/foi-docs/4_at_25.pdf |title=Top 50 Programmes on Channel 4 1982 \u2013 2007 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1993, the Channel 4 Schools idents featured famous people in one category, with light shining on them in front of an industrial looking setting supplemented by instrumental calming music. This changed in 1996 with the circles look to numerous children touching the screen, forming circles of information then picked up by other children. The last child would produce the channel 4 logo in the form of three vertical circles, with another in the middle and to the left containing the Channel 4 logo.\n\nA present feature of presentation was a countdown sequence featuring, in 1993 a slide with the programme name, and afterwards an extended sequence matching the channel branding. In 1996, this was an extended ident with timer in top left corner, and in 1999 following the adoption of the squares look, featured a square with timer slowly make its way across the right of the screen with people learning and having fun while doing so passing across the screen. It finished with the Channel 4 logo box on the right of the screen and the name 'Channel 4 Schools' being shown. This was adapted in 2000 when the service's name was changed to '4Learning'.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2001, this was altered to various scenes from classrooms around the world and different parts of school life. The countdown now flips over from the top, right, bottom and left with each second, and ends with four coloured squares, three of which are aligned vertically to the left of the Channel 4 logo, which is contained inside the fourth box. The tag 'Learning' is located directly beneath the logo. The final countdown sequence lasted between 2004 and 2005 and featured a background video of current controversial issues, overlaid with upcoming programming information. the video features people in the style of graffiti enacting the overuse of CCTV cameras, fox hunting, computer viruses and pirate videos, relationships, pollution of the seas and violent lifestyles.

Ranelagh's first major commission caused a furore, a three-part documentary series called ''[[Jesus: The Evidence]]''. The programmes, transmitted during the Easter period of 1984, seemed to advocate the idea that the Gospels were unreliable, Jesus may have indulged in witchcraft, and that he may not have even existed. The series triggered a public outcry, and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the UK's broadcasting and religious institutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Film ===\nNumerous genres of film-making \u2013 such as comedy, drama, documentary, adventure/action, romance and horror/thriller \u2013 are represented in the channel's schedule. From the launch of Channel 4 until 1998, film presentations on C4 would often be broadcast under the \"Film on Four\" banner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/840487/index.html |title=Channel 4 Films/Film on Four/FilmFour |website=BFI Screenonline |access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1304135/index.html |title=Channel 4 and Film |last=Brooke |first=Michael |website=BFI Screenonline |access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2005, Channel 4 screened the uncut [[Lars von Trier]] film ''[[The Idiots]]'', which includes unsimulated sexual intercourse, making it the first UK terrestrial channel to do so.

The Film4 channel carries a wide range of film productions, including acquired and Film4-produced projects.

The first show was about a [[Masturbate-a-thon]], a public mass masturbation event, organised to raise money for the [[sexual health]] charity [[Marie Stopes International]]. Another film would have focused on compulsive male masturbators and a third was to feature the [[sex education|sex educator]] Dr [[Betty Dodson]].\n\nThe series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4 |title=Channel 4 postpones 'wank week' programming |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n=== Global warming ===\nOn 8 March 2007, Channel 4 screened a highly controversial documentary, ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]''.

These four sites include features, profiles and interviews in text, audio and video formats, divided into five zones: TV, Film, Radio, New Media and Extras, which covers other arts such as theatre, music and design. 4Talent also collates networking, showcasing and professional development opportunities, and runs workshops, masterclasses, seminars and showcasing events across the UK.\n\n==== ''4Talent Magazine'' ====\n''4Talent magazine'' is the creative industries magazine from 4Talent, which launched in 2005 as TEN4 magazine under the editorship of Dan Jones. ''4Talent Magazine'' is currently edited by Nick Carson. Other staff include deputy editor Catherine Bray and production editor Helen Byrne. The magazine covers rising and established figures of interest in the creative industries, a remit including film, radio, TV, comedy, music, new media and design.\n\nSubjects are usually UK-based, with contributing editors based in Northern Ireland, Scotland, London and Birmingham, but the publication has been known to source international content from Australia, America, continental Europe and the Middle East. The magazine is frequently organised around a theme for the issue, for instance giving half of November 2007's pages over to profiling winners of the annual 4Talent Awards.\n\nAn unusual feature of the magazine's credits is the equal prominence given to the names of writers, photographers, designers and illustrators, contradicting standard industry practice of more prominent writer bylines. It is also recognisable for its 'wraparound' covers, which use the front and back as a continuous canvas \u2013 often produced by guest artists.\n\nAlthough ''4Talent Magazine'' is technically a newsstand title, a significant proportion of its readers are subscribers. It started life as a quarterly 100-page title, but has since doubled in size and is now published bi-annually.\n\n==Presentation==\nSince its launch in 1982, Channel 4 has used the same logo which consists of a stylised numeral \"4\" made up of nine differently shaped blocks. The logo was designed by [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]] and his brother Robinson and was the first channel in the UK to depict an ident made using advanced computer generation (the first electronically generated ident was on [[BBC Two]] [[BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident|in 1979,]] but this was two-dimensional). It was designed in conjunction with Bo Gehring Aviation of Los Angeles and originally depicted the \"4\" in red, yellow, green, blue and purple. The music accompanying the ident was called \"Fourscore\" and was composed by David Dundas; it was later released as a single alongside a B-side, \"Fourscore Two\", although neither reached the UK charts. In November 1992, \"Fourscore\" was replaced by new music.\n\nIn 1996, Channel 4 commissioned Tomato Films to revamp the \"4\", which resulted in the \"Circles\" idents showing four white circles forming up transparently over various scenes, with the \"4\" logo depicted in white in one of the circles.\n\nIn 1999, Spin redesigned the logo to feature in a single square which sat on the right-hand side of the screen, whilst various stripes would move along from left to right, often lighting the squared \"4\" up. Like previous \"Circles\" idents from 1996 (which was made by Tomato Films), the stripes would be interspersed with various scenes potentially related to the upcoming programme.\n\nThe logo was made three-dimensional again in 2004 when it was depicted in filmed scenes that show the blocks forming the \"4\" logo for less than a second before the action moves away again.\n\nIn 2015, the logo was disassembled completely to allow the blocks to appear as parts of a nature scene, sometimes featuring a strange dancing creature and sometimes being excavated for scientific study, one being studied under a microscope and showing a [[tardigrade]]. The second wave of these idents, launched in 2017, depict a giant creature made of the \"4\" blocks (made to look almost like a person) interacting with everyday life, sometimes shouting the \"Fourscore\" theme as a foghorn.\n\n==On-air identity==\n<gallery>\nFile:Channel 4 logo 1982.svg|Channel 4 logo from 1982 to 1996.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 1996.svg|Channel 4 logo from 1996 to 1999.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 1999.svg|Channel 4 logo from 1999 to 2004.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 2004.svg|Channel 4 logo from 2004 to 2015.\nFile:Channel 4 logo 2015.svg|Channel 4 logo from 2015.\n</gallery>\n\n==Regions/International ==\nChannel 4 has, since its inception, broadcast identical programmes and [[continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] throughout the United Kingdom (excluding Wales where it did not operate on analogue transmitters). At launch this made it unique, as both the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had long established traditions of providing [[regional variations]] in their programming in different areas of the country. Since the launch of subsequent British television channels, Channel 4 has become typical in its lack of regional programming variations.\n\nA few exceptions exist to this rule for programming and continuity:\n\nSome of Channel 4's schools' programming (1980s/early '90s) was regionalised due to differences in curricula between different regions.<ref name=\"itvschools\"/>\n\nPart of Channel 4's remit covers the commissioning of programmes from outside London. Channel 4 has a dedicated director of nations and regions, [[Stuart Cosgrove]], who is based in a regional office in Glasgow. As his job title suggests, it is his responsibility to foster relations with independent producers based in areas of the United Kingdom (including Wales) outside London.\n\nAdvertising on Channel 4 does contain regular variation: prior to 1993, when ITV was responsible for selling Channel 4's advertising, each regional ITV company would provide the content of advertising breaks, covering the same transmitter area as themselves, and these breaks were often unique to that area. After Channel 4 became responsible for its own advertising, it continued to offer advertisers the ability to target particular audiences and divided its coverage area into six regions: London, South,  Midlands, North, Northern Ireland and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map|title=Channel 4's 'Macro Regions' for advertising, including a map |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220084700/http://www.channel4sales.com/data/macro_map |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAt present, Wales does not have its own advertising region, instead its viewers receive the southern region on digital platforms intentionally broadcast to the area, or the neighbouring region where terrestrial transmissions spill over into Wales. The Republic of Ireland shares its advertising region with Northern Ireland (referred to by Channel 4 as the 'Ulster Macro') with many advertisers selling products for Ireland here.<ref name=\"foursales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |title=Channel 4's Dublin Sales Office |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527224137/http://www.channel4sales.com/advertising/regions/dublin |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}</ref> [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] has an advertising variant for Ireland, although Northern Ireland receives the UK version of E4.<ref name=\"foursales\"/> The six regions are also carried on satellite, cable and Digital Terrestrial.\n\n[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[ITV Breakfast]] use a similar model to Channel 4 for providing their own advertising regions, despite also having a single national output of programming.\n\nDespite the Republic of Ireland not being in the UK, Channel 4 has a dedicated variant broadcast on Sky Ireland which omits programmes for which broadcast rights are not held in Ireland. For example, the series [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']] is not available on Channel 4 on Sky in Ireland. In recent years a Republic of Ireland advertising opt-out has been added to this version.\n\n===Future possibility of regional news===\nWith [[ITV plc]] pushing for much looser requirements on the amount of regional news and other programming it is obliged to broadcast in its ITV regions, the idea of Channel 4 taking on a regional news commitment has been considered, with the corporation in talks with [[Ofcom]] and ITV over the matter.<ref name=\"c4moveregional\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/03/channel4.ofcom |title=Channel 4 ponders move into regional news as ITV retreats |work=The Guardian |author=Leigh Holmwood |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2008 |location=London}}</ref> Channel 4 believe that a scaling-back of such operations on ITV's part would be detrimental to Channel 4's national news operation, which shares much of its resources with ITV through their shared news contractor [[ITN]].

The word journalism applies to the [[journalist|occupation]], as well as [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] who gather and publish information. Journalistic media include print, television, radio, [[Internet]], and, in the past, [[newsreels]].\n\nConcepts of the appropriate role for journalism vary between countries. In some nations, the news media are controlled by government intervention and are not fully independent.<ref>\"[http://www.cpj.org/reports/2012/05/10-most-censored-countries.php 10 Most Censored Countries],\" Committee to Protect Journalists, 2 May 2012, page retrieved 23 May 2013.</ref> In others, the news media are independent of the government but instead operate as [[private industry]] motivated by [[profit motive|profit]]. In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded, countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the [[freedom of speech]] and [[Libel|libel cases]].\n\nThe proliferation of the Internet and [[smartphones]] has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through [[e-reader]]s, [[smartphone]]s, and other personal electronic devices, as opposed to the more traditional formats of [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, or [[News channel|television news channels]]. News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.<ref name=\":2\">https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/01/circulation-and-revenue-fall-for-newspaper-industry/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nJournalistic conventions vary by country. In the United States, journalism is produced by media organizations or by individuals. Bloggers are often, but not always, journalists. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] requires that bloggers who write about products received as promotional gifts to disclose that they received the products for free. This is intended to eliminate conflicts of interest and protect consumers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking|title=The FTC's Endorsement Guides: What People Are Asking|date=7 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, many credible news organizations are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated entities]]; have an editorial board, and exhibit separate editorial and advertising departments. Many credible news organizations, or their employees, often belong to and abide by the ethics of professional organizations such as the [[American Society of News Editors]], the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], [[Investigative Reporters & Editors|Investigative Reporters & Editors, Inc.]], or the [[Online News Association]]. Many news organizations also have their own codes of ethics that guide journalists' professional publications. For instance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' code of standards and ethics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytco.com/who-we-are/culture/standards-and-ethics/|title=Standards and Ethics|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> is considered particularly rigorous.{{By whom|date=June 2018}}\n\nWhen crafting news stories, regardless of the medium, fairness and bias are issues of concern to journalists. Some stories are intended to represent the author's own opinion; others are more neutral or feature balanced points-of-view. In a print newspaper, information is organized into sections and the distinction between opinionated and neutral stories is often clear. Online, many of these distinctions break down. Readers should pay careful attention to headings and other design elements to ensure that they understand the journalist's intent. Opinion pieces are generally written by regular columnists or appear in a section titled \"Op-ed\", while [[feature stories]], breaking news, and [[hard news]] stories typically make efforts to remove opinion from the copy.\n\nAccording to [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]], healthy journalism in a democratic country must provide an opinion of people in power and who wish to be in power, must include a range of opinions and must regard the informational needs of all people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|date=2012-10-01|title=Farewell to Journalism?|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=5\u20136|pages=614\u201326|doi=10.1080/17512786.2012.683273|issn=1751-2786}}</ref>\n\nMany debates centre on whether journalists are \"supposed\" to be \"objective\" and \"neutral\"; arguments include the fact that journalists produce news out of and as part of a particular social context, and that they are guided by professional codes of ethics and do their best to represent all legitimate points of view. Additionally, the ability to render a subject's complex and fluid narrative with sufficient accuracy is sometimes challenged by the time available to spend with subjects, the affordances or constraints of the medium used to tell the story, and the evolving nature of people's identities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T.J.|date=2018|title=The Evolution of Story: How Time and Modality Affect Visual and Verbal Narratives|journal=Visual Communication Quarterly|volume=25: 4|issue=4|pages=199\u2013210|doi=10.1080/15551393.2018.1498742}}</ref>\n\n==Forms==\n{{Main|Journalism genres}}\nThere are several forms of journalism with diverse audiences. Thus, journalism is said to serve the role of a \"[[fourth estate]]\", acting as a [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] on the workings of the government. A single publication (such as a newspaper) contains many forms of journalism, each of which may be presented in different formats. Each section of a newspaper, magazine, or website may cater to a different audience.{{sfn|Harcup|2009|p=4}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gerald Stone | first1 = Kaye O'Donnell | last2 = Banning | first2 = Stephen A. | year = 1997 | title = Public perceptions of a newspaper's watchdog role | url = | journal = Newspaper Research Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 1\u20132| pages = 86\u2013102 | doi=10.1177/073953299701800108}}</ref>\n[[File:Photojournalists photograph President Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Photojournalists photographing President Barack Obama of the US in November 2013.]] [[File:Suleiman Kova and media, 2013 DSM Building Collapse.jpg|thumb|[[Photojournalism|Photo]] and broadcast journalists interviewing a government official after a [[2013 Dar es Salaam building collapse|building collapse]] in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]].

In a 2014 study of journalists in the United States, 40% of participants claimed they rely on social media as a source, with over 20% depending on microblogs to collect facts.<ref name=\":0\" /> From this, the conclusion can be drawn that breaking news nowadays often stems from user-generated content, including videos and pictures posted online in social media.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/05/2013-american-journalist-key-findings.pdf|title=The American Journalist in the Digital Age: Key Findings|last=Willnat|first=Lars|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> However, though 69.2% of the surveyed journalists agreed that social media allowed them to connect to their audience, only 30% thought it had a positive influence on news credibility.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nConsequently, this has resulted in arguments to reconsider journalism as a process distributed among many authors, including the socially mediating public, rather than as individual products and articles written by dedicated journalists.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Sue|year=2011|title=\"Journalism as Process\": The Organizational Implications of Participatory Online News|journal=Journalism & Communication Monographs|volume=13|issue=3|page=137|doi=10.1177/152263791101300302}}</ref>\n\nBecause of these changes, the credibility ratings of news outlets has reached an all-time low. A 2014 study revealed that only 22% of Americans reported a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot of confidence\" in either television news or newspapers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heflin|first=Heflin|date=2015|title=The Internet Is Not the Antidote: A Cultural-Historical Analysis of Journalism's Crisis of Credibility and the Internet as a Remedy|url=|journal=Journalism History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Fake news ===\n\"Fake news\" is also deliberately untruthful information which can often spread quickly on social media or by means of [[fake news website]]s. It is often published to intentionally mislead readers to ultimately benefit a cause, organization or an individual. A glaring example was the proliferation of fake news in social media during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]]. Conspiracy theories, hoaxes, and lies have been circulated under the guise of news reports to benefit specific candidates. One example is a fabricated report of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email which was published by a non-existent newspaper called The Denver Guardian.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37896753|title=US election: Fake news becomes the news|date=2016-11-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many critics blamed Facebook for the spread of such material. Its news feed algorithm, in particular, was identified by [[Vox (website)|Vox]] as the platform where the social media giant exercise billions of editorial decisions every day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/6/13509854/facebook-politics-news-bad|title=Mark Zuckerberg is in denial about how Facebook is harming our politics|work=Vox|access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref> [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the CEO of Facebook, has acknowledged the company's role in this problem: in a testimony before a combined Senate Judiciary and Commerce committee hearing on April 20, 2018, he said:<blockquote>It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/09/facebook-chief-executive-mark-zuckerberg-to-captiol-hill-it-was-my-mistake-and-im-sorry/|title=Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill: \u2018It was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u2019|last=Timberg|first=Craig|date=2018-04-09|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-26|last2=Romm|first2=Tony|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref></blockquote>Readers can often evaluate credibility of news by examining the credibility of the underlying news organization.\n\nThe phrase was popularized and inaccurately used by [[Donald Trump]] during his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] to discredit what he perceived as negative news coverage of his candidacy and then the presidency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/9/17335306/trump-tweet-twitter-latest-fake-news-credentials|title=Trump finally admits that \"fake news\" just means news he doesn\u2019t like|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Propaganda compared with fake news ===\nThe definition of 'fake news' above, could also be applied to the general category of 'Propaganda' when it is applied to the field of political reporting. Because a large part of political journalism involves ''analysis'', and not simple reporting of what is said, or presented, writers and journalists have the opportunity to present specific kinds of analysis which can favor one ideological or political position over another; it can also be used to represent ''personalities'' in favorable/unfavorable ways. If the definition of propaganda includes misrepresentation of facts, and deliberate distortions of narrative, or applied ''emphasis'' not necessarily contained in the original, then Fake News falls squarely inside the parameters of Propaganda also. It could be argued that true ''objectivity'' is not really possible to produce when it comes to presenting an analysis of political activity, any individual observer and journalist is going to perceive what they experience through the lens of their own political bias, this, of course, is the case with entire organizations also.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of journalism}}{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Journalism in antiquity ===\nWhile publications reporting the news to the general public in a standardized fashion only began to appear in the 17th century and later, governments as early as [[Han dynasty|Han dynasty China]] made use of regularly published news bulletins.<ref>Hartmut Walravens: \"The Early East Asian Press in the Eyes of the West.

Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216\u201317</ref> These bulletins, however, were intended only for government officials, and thus were not journalistic news publications in the modern sense of the term.\n\n=== Early modern newspapers ===\nAs mass-printing technologies like the [[printing press]] spread, newspapers were established to provide increasingly literate audiences with the news. The first references to privately owned newspaper publishers in [[China]] date to the late [[Ming dynasty]] in 1582.<ref>[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

The first successful English daily, the ''[[Daily Courant]]'', was published from 1702 to 1735.<ref>{{cite web |title=First Journalism School |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |page=1}}</ref> While journalistic enterprises were started as private ventures in some regions, such as [[The Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], other countries such as [[France]] and [[Prussia]] kept tighter control of the press, treating it primarily as an outlet for government propaganda and subjecting it to uniform [[censorship]]. Other governments, such as the [[Russian Empire]], were even more distrusting of the journalistic press and effectively banned journalistic publications until the mid-19th century.<ref>Nurit Schleifman, \"A Russian Daily Newspaper and Its New Readership:\" Severnaia Pchela\", 1825\u20131840.\" ''Cahiers du monde russe et sovietique'' (1987): 127\u201344</ref> As newspaper publication became a more and more established practice, publishers would increase publication to a weekly or daily rate. Newspapers were more heavily concentrated in cities that were centres of trade, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], and [[Berlin]]. The first newspapers in Latin America would be established in the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\n==== News media and the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries ====\nNewspapers played a significant role in mobilizing popular support in favor of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] revolutions of the late 18th and 19th centuries. In the [[American Colonies]], newspapers motivated people to revolt against British rule by publishing grievances against the British crown and republishing pamphlets by revolutionaries such as [[Thomas Paine]],<ref>William Sloan and Julie Hedgepeth Williams, ''The early American press, 1690\u20131783'' (1994)</ref><ref>Vaughn, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism'' (2008), pp. 17\u201321</ref> while [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] publications motivated support against the [[American Revolution]].<ref>Carol Sue Humphrey, ''This popular engine: New England newspapers during the American Revolution, 1775\u20131789'' (1992)</ref> News publications in the [[United States]] would remain proudly and publicly [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] throughout the 19th century.<ref>Richard L. Kaplan, ''Politics and the American press: The rise of objectivity, 1865\u20131920'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p. 78.</ref> In France, political newspapers sprang up during the [[French Revolution]], with ''[[L'Ami du peuple]]'', edited by [[Jean-Paul Marat]], playing a particularly famous role in arguing for the rights of the revolutionary lower classes. [[Napoleon]] would reintroduce strict censorship laws in 1800, but after his reign print publications would flourish and play an important role in political culture.<ref>Keith Michael Baker, et al., ''The French Revolution and the Creation of Modern Political Culture: The transformation of the political culture, 1789\u20131848'' (1989).</ref> As part of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], radical liberal publications such as the ''Rheinische Zeitung, Pesti H\u00edrlap,'' and ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' would motivate people toward deposing the [[aristocratic]] governments of [[Central Europe]].<ref>Sperber, Jonathan, ''Rhineland Radicals: The Democratic Movement and the Revolution of 1848'' (Princeton, 1991), p. 99;</ref> Other liberal publications played a more moderate role: ''The Russian Bulletin'' praised [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II of Russia's]] liberal reforms in the late 19th century, and supported increased political and economic freedoms for peasants as well as the establishment of a [[Duma|parliamentary system]] in Russia.<ref>Daniel Balmuth, ''\"The Russian Bulletin,\" 1863\u20131917: A Liberal Voice in Tsarist Russia'' (2000)</ref> Farther to the [[Left politics|left]], [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Communism|communist]] newspapers had wide followings in France, Russia and Germany despite being outlawed by the government.<ref>Charles A.

The overthrow of the old imperial regime in 1911 produced a surge in Chinese nationalism, an end to censorship, and a demand for professional, nation-wide journalism.<ref>Stephen MacKinnon, \u201cToward a History of the Chinese Press in the Republican Period,\u201d ''Modern China'' 23#1 (1997) pp. 3\u201332</ref>  All the major cities launched such efforts.  By the late 1920s, however, there was a much greater emphasis on advertising and expanding circulation, and much less interest in the sort of advocacy journalism that had inspired the revolutionaries.<ref>Timothy B. Weston, \"China, professional journalism, and liberal internationalism in the era of the First World War.\" ''Pacific Affairs'' 83.2 (2010): 327\u201347.</ref>\n\n====France====\n{{Main|History of French journalism}}\nThe Parisian newspapers were largely stagnant after the war; circulation inched up to 6 million a day from 5 million in 1910.  The major postwar success story was ''[[Paris-Soir|Paris Soir]]''; which lacked any political agenda and was dedicated to providing a mix of sensational reporting to aid circulation, and serious articles to build prestige.  By 1939 its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid ''Le Petit Parisien.''   In addition to its daily paper ''Paris Soir'' sponsored a highly successful women's magazine ''Marie-Claire.'' Another magazine ''[[Paris Match|Match]]'' was modeled after the photojournalism of the American magazine ''Life.''\n<ref>Hutton 2:692\u201394</ref>\n\n====Great Britain====\n{{Main|History of journalism in the United Kingdom}}\nBy 1900 popular journalism in Britain aimed at the largest possible audience, including the working class, had proven a success and made its profits through advertising. [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] (1865\u20131922), \"More than anyone... shaped the modern press.  Developments he introduced or harnessed remain central: broad contents, exploitation of advertising revenue to subsidize prices, aggressive marketing, subordinate regional markets, independence from party control.<ref>P.P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure, \"Northcliffe, Viscount.\" in John Ramsden, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century British Politics'' (2002) p. 475.</ref>   His ''[[Daily Mail]]'' held the world record for daily circulation until his death. Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] quipped it was \"written by office boys for office boys\".<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Quotations'' (1975).</ref>\n\n==== India ====\n{{Main|History of Indian journalism}}\nThe first newspaper of India, [[Hicky's Bengal Gazette]], was published on January 29, 1780. This first effort at journalism enjoyed only a short stint yet it was a momentous development, as it gave birth to modern journalism in India. Following Hicky's efforts which had to be shut down just within two years of circulation, several English newspapers started publication in the aftermath. Most of them enjoyed a circulation figure of about 400 and were weeklies giving personal news items and classified advertisements about a variety of products. Later on, in the 1800s, English newspapers were started by Indian publishers with English-speaking Indians as the target audience. During that era vast differences in language was a major problem in facilitating smooth communication among the people of the country. This is because they hardly knew the languages prevalent in other parts of this vast land. However, English came as the ''''linguafranca'''' for everyone from across the country. Notable among this breed is the one named \u2018Bengal Gazette\u2019 started by Gangadhar Bhattacharyya in 1816.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|History of American journalism}}\nThe late 19th and early 20th century in the [[United States]] saw the advent of media empires controlled by the likes of [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]]. Realizing that they could expand their audience by abandoning politically polarized content, thus making more money off of [[Advertisement|advertising]], American newspapers began to abandon their partisan politics in favor of less political reporting starting around 1900.<ref>Richard Lee Kaplan, ''Politics and the American press: the rise of objectivity, 1865\u20131920'' (2002) p. 76</ref> Newspapers of this era embraced sensationalized reporting and larger headline typefaces and layouts, a style that would become dubbed \"[[yellow journalism]]\".

While the first [[African Americans|Black]] newspapers in America were established in the early 19th century,<ref>Charles A. Simmons, ''The African American press: a history of news coverage during national crises, with special reference to four black newspapers, 1827\u20131965'' (McFarland, 2006)</ref> in the 20th century these newspapers truly flourished in major cities, with publishers playing a major role in politics and business affairs. Representative leaders included [[Robert Sengstacke Abbott]] (1870\u20131940), publisher of the [[Chicago Defender]]; [[John Mitchell, Jr.]] (1863\u20131929), editor of the ''Richmond Planet'' and president of the National Afro-American Press Association; [[Anthony Overton]] (1865\u20131946), publisher of the [[Chicago Bee]], and [[Robert Lee Vann]] (1879\u20131940), the publisher and editor of the [[Pittsburgh Courier]].<ref>Patrick S.

Lippmann's views prevailed for decades, helping to bolster the Progressives' confidence in decision-making by experts, with the general public standing by. Lippmann argued that high-powered journalism was wasted on ordinary citizens, but was of genuine value to an elite class of administrators and experts.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Davis \"Buzz\" Merritt|author2=Maxwell E.

When issues were thoroughly vetted, then the best ideas would bubble to the surface. The danger of demagoguery and false news did not trouble Dewey. His faith in popular democracy has been implemented in various degrees, and is now known as \"[[community journalism]]\".<ref>Carl Bybee, \"Can democracy survive in the post-factual age?: A return to the Lippmann-Dewey debate about the politics of news.\" ''Journalism & Communication Monographs'' 1.1 (1999): 28\u201366.</ref> The 1920s debate has been endlessly repeated across the globe, as journalists wrestle with their roles.<ref>Alfred Hermida, et al. \"The active recipient: Participatory journalism through the lens of the Dewey-Lippmann debate.\" ''International Symposium on Online Journalism'' 1#2 (2011).</ref>\n\n==== Radio ====\n[[Radio broadcasting]] increased in popularity starting in the 1920s, becoming widespread in the 1930s. While most radio programming was oriented toward music, sports, and entertainment, radio also broadcast speeches and occasional news programming. Radio reached the peak of its importance during [[World War II]], as radio and [[newsreel]]s were the two main sources of up-to-date information on the ongoing war. {{dubious|date=November 2018}} {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In the [[Soviet Union]], radio would be heavily utilized by the state to broadcast political speeches by leadership. These broadcasts would very rarely have any additional editorial content or analysis, setting them apart from modern news reporting.<ref>Stephen Lovell, \"Broadcasting Bolshevik: The radio voice of Soviet culture, 1920s\u20131950s.\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 48.1 (2013): 78\u201397.</ref> The radio would however soon be eclipsed by [[broadcast television]] starting in the 1950s.\n\n=== Television ===\n{{Main|News broadcasting}}\nStarting in the 1940s, [[United States]] broadcast television channels would air 10-to-15-minute segments of news programming one or two times per evening. The era of live-TV news coverage would begin in the 1960s with the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], broadcast and reported to live on a variety of nationally syndicated television channels. During the 60s and 70s, television channels would begin adding regular morning or midday news shows. Starting in 1980 with the establishment of [[CNN]], news channels began providing 24-hour news coverage, a format which persists through today.\n\n=== Digital age ===\nThe role and status of journalism, as well as mass media, has undergone changes over the last two decades, together with the advancement of digital technology and publication of news on the [[Internet]]. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through [[e-readers]], [[smartphones]], and other electronic devices. News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nNotably, in the American media landscape, [[newsroom]]s have reduced their staff and coverage as traditional media channels, such as television, grappling with declining audiences. For example, between 2007 and 2012, [[CNN]] edited its story packages into nearly half of their original time length.<ref name=\"State\">\"[http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/overview-5/ \"The State of the News Media 2013: An Annual Report in American Journalism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826025836/http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/overview-5/ |date=26 August 2017 }}\", the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, 2 May 2012.

Using video camera-equipped smartphones, active citizens are now enabled to record footage of news events and upload them onto channels like [[YouTube]] (which is often discovered and used by mainstream news media outlets). News from a variety of online sources, like [[blogs]] and other social media, results in a wider choice of official and unofficial sources, rather than only traditional media organizations.\n\n[[File:Cosplayers at Comicdom 2012 in Athens, Greece grant interviews to the MTV television channel 21.JPG|thumb|Journalists interviewing a [[cosplay]]er]]\n\n==Professional and ethical standards==\n{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}\n\n[[File:News photographers and reporters wait outside Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' apartment.jpg|thumb|News photographers and reporters waiting behind a police line in [[New York City]], in May 1994]]\nWhile various existing codes have some differences, most share common elements including the principles of \u2013 [[truth]]fulness, [[accuracy]], [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]], impartiality, fairness and public accountability \u2013 as these apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fourth Estate \u2013 Core Journalism Principles, Standards and Practices|url=https://www.fourthestate.org/core-journalism-principles/|publisher=Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/status-of-journalists-and-journalism-ethics-ifj-principles IFJ (International Federation of Journalists) \u2013 Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114075747/http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/status-of-journalists-and-journalism-ethics-ifj-principles |date=14 November 2012 }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081130181610/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/060/151/2bcb53c-c641f97.doc DOC version)]\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/principl.htm |title=ASNE (American Society of Newspapers Editors) \u2013 Statement of Principles |accessdate=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605161914/http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/principl.htm |archivedate=5 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apme.com/ethics/ |title=APME (Associated Press Managing Editors) \u2013 Statement of Ethical Principles |date=2008-06-22 |accessdate=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622123407/http://www.apme.com/ethics/ |archivedate=22 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp |title=(Society of Professional Journalists) \u2013 Code of Ethics |publisher=SPJ |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Kovach]] and Tom Rosenstiel propose several guidelines for journalists in their book ''The Elements of Journalism''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.org/node/72|title=The Elements of Journalism: What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect \u2013 Introduction &#124; Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ)|date=2006-06-19|publisher=Journalism.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002000433/http://www.journalism.org/node/72|archivedate=2 October 2013|accessdate=2013-02-23}}\n</ref>\nTheir view is that journalism's first loyalty is to the citizenry and that journalists are thus obliged to tell the truth and must serve as an independent monitor of powerful individuals and institutions within society.

This includes points like respecting people's privacy and ensuring accuracy. However, the Media Standards Trust has criticized the PCC, claiming it needs to be radically changed to secure the public trust of newspapers.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the media climate prior to the 20th century, where the media market was dominated by smaller newspapers and pamphleteers who usually had an overt and often radical agenda, with no presumption of balance or objectivity.\n\nBecause of the pressure on journalists to report news promptly and before their competitors, factual errors occur more frequently than in writing produced and edited under less time pressure. Thus a typical issue of a major daily newspaper may contain several corrections of articles published the previous day.  Perhaps the most famous journalistic mistake caused by time pressure was the [[Dewey Defeats Truman]] edition of the [[Chicago Daily Tribune]],  based on early election returns that failed to anticipate the actual result of the 1948 US presidential election.\n\n===Failing to uphold standards===\n{{Original research section|date=January 2015}}\nSuch a [[code of conduct]] can, in the real world, be difficult to uphold consistently. Reporting and editing do not occur in a vacuum but always reflect the political context in which journalists, no less than other citizens, operate.\n\nA news organization's budget inevitably reflects decision-making about what news to cover, for what audience, and in what depth. When budgets are cut, editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus, reduce the number of staff assigned to low-income areas, or wipe entire communities from the publication's zone of interest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nPublishers, owners and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a \"firewall\" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/bloomberg_news_and_the_problem.php|title=Bloomberg News and the problem of church-state separation|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Codes of ethics ===\nThere are over 242 codes of ethics in journalism that vary across various regions of the world.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|date=2016-03-01|title=Ethical convergence, divergence or communitas?

The second claim of justifiable consequences centers on weighing the benefits and detriments of a potentially harmful story and acting accordingly. An example of justifiable consequence is exposing a professional with dubious practices; on the other hand, acting within justifiable consequence means writing compassionately about a family in mourning. The third claim is the claim of humanity which states that journalists are writing for a global population and therefore must serve everyone globally in their work, avoiding smaller loyalties to country, city, etc.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe characteristic of healthy journalism: the independence of the press and the government, the opinions of journalists are objective and no bias to any race, gender, and do not have any commercial pressures.

Some governments guarantee the freedom of the press; while other nations severely restrict what journalists can research or publish.\n\nJournalists in many nations have some privileges that members of the general public do not, including better access to public events, crime scenes and press conferences, and to extended interviews with public officials, celebrities and others in the public eye.\n\nJournalists who elect to cover [[War|conflicts]], whether [[war]]s between nations or [[insurgency|insurgencies]] within nations, often give up any expectation of protection by government, if not giving up their rights to protection from the government.

Many governments around the world target journalists for intimidation, harassment, and violence because of the nature of their work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Freedom Online|url=http://www.cpj.org/|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref>\n\n===Right to protect confidentiality of sources===\n{{Main|Protection of sources}}\n\nJournalists' interaction with sources sometimes involves [[confidentiality]], an extension of freedom of the press giving journalists a legal protection to keep the identity of a [[confidential informant]] private even when demanded by police or prosecutors; withholding their sources can land journalists in contempt of court, or in jail.\n\nIn the United States, there is no right to protect sources in a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] court. However, federal courts will refuse to force journalists to reveal their sources, unless the information the court seeks is highly relevant to the case and there's no other way to get it. State courts provide varying degrees of such protection. Journalists who refuse to testify even when ordered to can be found in [[contempt of court]] and fined or jailed. On the journalistic side of keeping sources confidential, there is also a risk to the journalist's credibility because there can be no actual confirmation of whether the information is valid. As such it is highly discouraged for journalists to have confidential sources.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Citizen Journalism]]\n* [[Fourth Estate]]\n* [[Hallin's spheres]]\n* [[History of American newspapers]]\n* [[History of journalism]]\n* [[Journalism education]] and [[Journalism school]]\n* [[Journalism ethics and standards]]\n* [[Journalism genres]]\n* [[Lists of journalists]]\n* [[List of journalism awards]]\n* [[Non-profit journalism]]\n* [[Objectivity (journalism)]]\n* [[Sensor journalism]]\n* [[Sports journalism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Journalism reviews===\n* ''[[American Journalism Review]]''\n* ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''\n* ''[[Health News Review]]''\n* ''[[Ryerson Review of Journalism]]''\n\n====Academic journals====\n* ''[[Journalism Practice]]''\n* ''[[Journalism Studies]]''\n* ''[[Journalism (journal)]]''\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation|last=Harcup |first=Tony |title=Journalism: Principles and Practice |year=2009 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=978-1-84787-250-0 |oclc=280437077 |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]]}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kaltenbrunner, Andy and Matthias Karmasin and Daniela Kraus, eds. \"The Journalism Report V: Innovation and Transition\", Facultas, 2017\n* Quick, Amanda C. ed.

The word journalism applies to the [[journalist|occupation]], as well as [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] who gather and publish information. Journalistic media include print, television, radio, [[Internet]], and, in the past, [[newsreels]].\n\nConcepts of the appropriate role for journalism vary between countries. In some nations, the news media are controlled by government intervention and are not fully independent.<ref>\"[http://www.cpj.org/reports/2012/05/10-most-censored-countries.php 10 Most Censored Countries],\" Committee to Protect Journalists, 2 May 2012, page retrieved 23 May 2013.</ref> In others, the news media are independent of the government but instead operate as [[private industry]] motivated by [[profit motive|profit]]. In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded, countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the [[freedom of speech]] and [[Libel|libel cases]].\n\nThe proliferation of the Internet and [[smartphones]] has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through [[e-reader]]s, [[smartphone]]s, and other personal electronic devices, as opposed to the more traditional formats of [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, or [[News channel|television news channels]]. News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.<ref name=\":2\">https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/01/circulation-and-revenue-fall-for-newspaper-industry/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nJournalistic conventions vary by country. In the United States, journalism is produced by media organizations or by individuals. Bloggers are often, but not always, journalists. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] requires that bloggers who write about products received as promotional gifts to disclose that they received the products for free. This is intended to eliminate conflicts of interest and protect consumers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking|title=The FTC's Endorsement Guides: What People Are Asking|date=7 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, many credible news organizations are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated entities]]; have an editorial board, and exhibit separate editorial and advertising departments. Many credible news organizations, or their employees, often belong to and abide by the ethics of professional organizations such as the [[American Society of News Editors]], the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], [[Investigative Reporters & Editors|Investigative Reporters & Editors, Inc.]], or the [[Online News Association]]. Many news organizations also have their own codes of ethics that guide journalists' professional publications. For instance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' code of standards and ethics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytco.com/who-we-are/culture/standards-and-ethics/|title=Standards and Ethics|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> is considered particularly rigorous.{{By whom|date=June 2018}}\n\nWhen crafting news stories, regardless of the medium, fairness and bias are issues of concern to journalists. Some stories are intended to represent the author's own opinion; others are more neutral or feature balanced points-of-view. In a print newspaper, information is organized into sections and the distinction between opinionated and neutral stories is often clear. Online, many of these distinctions break down. Readers should pay careful attention to headings and other design elements to ensure that they understand the journalist's intent. Opinion pieces are generally written by regular columnists or appear in a section titled \"Op-ed\", while [[feature stories]], breaking news, and [[hard news]] stories typically make efforts to remove opinion from the copy.\n\nAccording to [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]], healthy journalism in a democratic country must provide an opinion of people in power and who wish to be in power, must include a range of opinions and must regard the informational needs of all people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|date=2012-10-01|title=Farewell to Journalism?|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=5\u20136|pages=614\u201326|doi=10.1080/17512786.2012.683273|issn=1751-2786}}</ref>\n\nMany debates centre on whether journalists are \"supposed\" to be \"objective\" and \"neutral\"; arguments include the fact that journalists produce news out of and as part of a particular social context, and that they are guided by professional codes of ethics and do their best to represent all legitimate points of view. Additionally, the ability to render a subject's complex and fluid narrative with sufficient accuracy is sometimes challenged by the time available to spend with subjects, the affordances or constraints of the medium used to tell the story, and the evolving nature of people's identities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T.J.|date=2018|title=The Evolution of Story: How Time and Modality Affect Visual and Verbal Narratives|journal=Visual Communication Quarterly|volume=25: 4|issue=4|pages=199\u2013210|doi=10.1080/15551393.2018.1498742}}</ref>\n\n==Forms==\n{{Main|Journalism genres}}\nThere are several forms of journalism with diverse audiences. Thus, journalism is said to serve the role of a \"[[fourth estate]]\", acting as a [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] on the workings of the government. A single publication (such as a newspaper) contains many forms of journalism, each of which may be presented in different formats. Each section of a newspaper, magazine, or website may cater to a different audience.{{sfn|Harcup|2009|p=4}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gerald Stone | first1 = Kaye O'Donnell | last2 = Banning | first2 = Stephen A. | year = 1997 | title = Public perceptions of a newspaper's watchdog role | url = | journal = Newspaper Research Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 1\u20132| pages = 86\u2013102 | doi=10.1177/073953299701800108}}</ref>\n[[File:Photojournalists photograph President Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Photojournalists photographing President Barack Obama of the US in November 2013.]] [[File:Suleiman Kova and media, 2013 DSM Building Collapse.jpg|thumb|[[Photojournalism|Photo]] and broadcast journalists interviewing a government official after a [[2013 Dar es Salaam building collapse|building collapse]] in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]].

In a 2014 study of journalists in the United States, 40% of participants claimed they rely on social media as a source, with over 20% depending on microblogs to collect facts.<ref name=\":0\" /> From this, the conclusion can be drawn that breaking news nowadays often stems from user-generated content, including videos and pictures posted online in social media.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/05/2013-american-journalist-key-findings.pdf|title=The American Journalist in the Digital Age: Key Findings|last=Willnat|first=Lars|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> However, though 69.2% of the surveyed journalists agreed that social media allowed them to connect to their audience, only 30% thought it had a positive influence on news credibility.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nConsequently, this has resulted in arguments to reconsider journalism as a process distributed among many authors, including the socially mediating public, rather than as individual products and articles written by dedicated journalists.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Sue|year=2011|title=\"Journalism as Process\": The Organizational Implications of Participatory Online News|journal=Journalism & Communication Monographs|volume=13|issue=3|page=137|doi=10.1177/152263791101300302}}</ref>\n\nBecause of these changes, the credibility ratings of news outlets has reached an all-time low. A 2014 study revealed that only 22% of Americans reported a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot of confidence\" in either television news or newspapers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heflin|first=Heflin|date=2015|title=The Internet Is Not the Antidote: A Cultural-Historical Analysis of Journalism's Crisis of Credibility and the Internet as a Remedy|url=|journal=Journalism History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Fake news ===\n\"Fake news\" is also deliberately untruthful information which can often spread quickly on social media or by means of [[fake news website]]s. It is often published to intentionally mislead readers to ultimately benefit a cause, organization or an individual. A glaring example was the proliferation of fake news in social media during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]]. Conspiracy theories, hoaxes, and lies have been circulated under the guise of news reports to benefit specific candidates. One example is a fabricated report of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email which was published by a non-existent newspaper called The Denver Guardian.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37896753|title=US election: Fake news becomes the news|date=2016-11-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many critics blamed Facebook for the spread of such material. Its news feed algorithm, in particular, was identified by [[Vox (website)|Vox]] as the platform where the social media giant exercise billions of editorial decisions every day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/6/13509854/facebook-politics-news-bad|title=Mark Zuckerberg is in denial about how Facebook is harming our politics|work=Vox|access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref> [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the CEO of Facebook, has acknowledged the company's role in this problem: in a testimony before a combined Senate Judiciary and Commerce committee hearing on April 20, 2018, he said:<blockquote>It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/09/facebook-chief-executive-mark-zuckerberg-to-captiol-hill-it-was-my-mistake-and-im-sorry/|title=Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill: \u2018It was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u2019|last=Timberg|first=Craig|date=2018-04-09|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-26|last2=Romm|first2=Tony|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref></blockquote>Readers can often evaluate credibility of news by examining the credibility of the underlying news organization.\n\nThe phrase was popularized and inaccurately used by [[Donald Trump]] during his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] to discredit what he perceived as negative news coverage of his candidacy and then the presidency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/9/17335306/trump-tweet-twitter-latest-fake-news-credentials|title=Trump finally admits that \"fake news\" just means news he doesn\u2019t like|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Propaganda compared with fake news ===\nThe definition of 'fake news' above, could also be applied to the general category of 'Propaganda' when it is applied to the field of political reporting. Because a large part of political journalism involves ''analysis'', and not simple reporting of what is said, or presented, writers and journalists have the opportunity to present specific kinds of analysis which can favor one ideological or political position over another; it can also be used to represent ''personalities'' in favorable/unfavorable ways. If the definition of propaganda includes misrepresentation of facts, and deliberate distortions of narrative, or applied ''emphasis'' not necessarily contained in the original, then Fake News falls squarely inside the parameters of Propaganda also. It could be argued that true ''objectivity'' is not really possible to produce when it comes to presenting an analysis of political activity, any individual observer and journalist is going to perceive what they experience through the lens of their own political bias, this, of course, is the case with entire organizations also.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of journalism}}{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Journalism in antiquity ===\nWhile publications reporting the news to the general public in a standardized fashion only began to appear in the 17th century and later, governments as early as [[Han dynasty|Han dynasty China]] made use of regularly published news bulletins.<ref>Hartmut Walravens: \"The Early East Asian Press in the Eyes of the West.

Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216\u201317</ref> These bulletins, however, were intended only for government officials, and thus were not journalistic news publications in the modern sense of the term.\n\n=== Early modern newspapers ===\nAs mass-printing technologies like the [[printing press]] spread, newspapers were established to provide increasingly literate audiences with the news. The first references to privately-owned newspaper publishers in [[China]] date to the late [[Ming dynasty]] in 1582.<ref>[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

The first successful English daily, the ''[[Daily Courant]]'', was published from 1702 to 1735.<ref>{{cite web |title=First Journalism School |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |page=1}}</ref> While journalistic enterprises were started as private ventures in some regions, such as [[The Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], other countries such as [[France]] and [[Prussia]] kept tighter control of the press, treating it primarily as an outlet for government propaganda and subjecting it to uniform [[censorship]]. Other governments, such as the [[Russian Empire]], were even more distrusting of the journalistic press and effectively banned journalistic publications until the mid-19th century.<ref>Nurit Schleifman, \"A Russian Daily Newspaper and Its New Readership:\" Severnaia Pchela\", 1825\u20131840.\" ''Cahiers du monde russe et sovietique'' (1987): 127\u201344</ref> As newspaper publication became a more and more established practice, publishers would increase publication to a weekly or daily rate. Newspapers were more heavily concentrated in cities that were centres of trade, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], and [[Berlin]]. The first newspapers in Latin America would be established in the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\n==== News media and the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries ====\nNewspapers played a significant role in mobilizing popular support in favor of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] revolutions of the late 18th and 19th centuries. In the [[American Colonies]], newspapers motivated people to revolt against British rule by publishing grievances against the British crown and republishing pamphlets by revolutionaries such as [[Thomas Paine]],<ref>William Sloan and Julie Hedgepeth Williams, ''The early American press, 1690\u20131783'' (1994)</ref><ref>Vaughn, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism'' (2008), pp. 17\u201321</ref> while [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] publications motivated support against the [[American Revolution]].<ref>Carol Sue Humphrey, ''This popular engine: New England newspapers during the American Revolution, 1775\u20131789'' (1992)</ref> News publications in the [[United States]] would remain proudly and publicly [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] throughout the 19th century.<ref>Richard L.

The overthrow of the old imperial regime in 1911 produced a surge in Chinese nationalism, an end to censorship, and a demand for professional, nation-wide journalism.<ref>Stephen MacKinnon, \u201cToward a History of the Chinese Press in the Republican Period,\u201d ''Modern China'' 23#1 (1997) pp. 3\u201332</ref>  All the major cities launched such efforts.

The major postwar success story was ''[[Paris-Soir|Paris Soir]]''; which lacked any political agenda and was dedicated to providing a mix of sensational reporting to aid circulation, and serious articles to build prestige.  By 1939 its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid ''Le Petit Parisien.''   In addition to its daily paper ''Paris Soir'' sponsored a highly successful women's magazine ''Marie-Claire.''

This first effort at journalism enjoyed only a short stint yet it was a momentous development, as it gave birth to modern journalism in India. Following Hicky's efforts which had to be shut down just within two years of circulation, several English newspapers started publication in the aftermath. Most of them enjoyed a circulation figure of about 400 and were weeklies giving personal news items and classified advertisements about a variety of products. Later on, in the 1800s, English newspapers were started by Indian publishers with English-speaking Indians as the target audience. During that era vast differences in language was a major problem in facilitating smooth communication among the people of the country. This is because they hardly knew the languages prevalent in other parts of this vast land. However, English came as the ''''linguafranca'''' for everyone from across the country. Notable among this breed is the one named \u2018Bengal Gazette\u2019 started by Gangadhar Bhattacharyya in 1816.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|History of American journalism}}\nThe late 19th and early 20th century in the [[United States]] saw the advent of media empires controlled by the likes of [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]]. Realizing that they could expand their audience by abandoning politically polarized content, thus making more money off of [[Advertisement|advertising]], American newspapers began to abandon their partisan politics in favor of less political reporting starting around 1900.<ref>Richard Lee Kaplan, ''Politics and the American press: the rise of objectivity, 1865\u20131920'' (2002) p. 76</ref> Newspapers of this era embraced sensationalized reporting and larger headline typefaces and layouts, a style that would become dubbed \"[[yellow journalism]]\". Newspaper publishing became much more heavily professionalized in this era, and issues of writing quality and workroom discipline saw vast improvement.<ref>Frank Luther Mott, ''American Journalism: A History, 1690\u20131960'' (Macmillan, 3rd ed. 1962) pp. 603\u201305</ref> This era saw the establishment of [[freedom of the press]] as a legal norm, as President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] tried and failed to sue newspapers for reporting [[corruption]] in his handling of the purchase of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref>Mott, ''American Journalism'' (3rd ed, 1962) pp. 605\u201308.</ref> Still, critics note that although government's ability to suppress journalistic speech is heavily limited, the concentration of newspaper (and general media) ownership in the hands of a small number of private business owners leads to other biases in reporting and media self-censorship that benefits the interests of [[corporation]]s and the government.<ref>[[Chris Hedges|Hedges, Chris]] (2009).

While the first [[African Americans|Black]] newspapers in America were established in the early 19th century,<ref>Charles A. Simmons, ''The African American press: a history of news coverage during national crises, with special reference to four black newspapers, 1827\u20131965'' (McFarland, 2006)</ref> in the 20th century these newspapers truly flourished in major cities, with publishers playing a major role in politics and business affairs. Representative leaders included [[Robert Sengstacke Abbott]] (1870\u20131940), publisher of the [[Chicago Defender]]; [[John Mitchell, Jr.]] (1863\u20131929), editor of the ''Richmond Planet'' and president of the National Afro-American Press Association; [[Anthony Overton]] (1865\u20131946), publisher of the [[Chicago Bee]], and [[Robert Lee Vann]] (1879\u20131940), the publisher and editor of the [[Pittsburgh Courier]].<ref>Patrick S.

Lippmann's views prevailed for decades, helping to bolster the Progressives' confidence in decision-making by experts, with the general public standing by. Lippmann argued that high-powered journalism was wasted on ordinary citizens, but was of genuine value to an elite class of administrators and experts.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Davis \"Buzz\" Merritt|author2=Maxwell E.

When issues were thoroughly vetted, then the best ideas would bubble to the surface. The danger of demagoguery and false news did not trouble Dewey. His faith in popular democracy has been implemented in various degrees, and is now known as \"[[community journalism]]\".<ref>Carl Bybee, \"Can democracy survive in the post-factual age?: A return to the Lippmann-Dewey debate about the politics of news.\" ''Journalism & Communication Monographs'' 1.1 (1999): 28\u201366.</ref> The 1920s debate has been endlessly repeated across the globe, as journalists wrestle with their roles.<ref>Alfred Hermida, et al. \"The active recipient: Participatory journalism through the lens of the Dewey-Lippmann debate.\" ''International Symposium on Online Journalism'' 1#2 (2011).</ref>\n\n==== Radio ====\n[[Radio broadcasting]] increased in popularity starting in the 1920s, becoming widespread in the 1930s. While most radio programming was oriented toward music, sports, and entertainment, radio also broadcast speeches and occasional news programming. Radio reached the peak of its importance during [[World War II]], as radio and [[newsreel]]s were the two main sources of up-to-date information on the ongoing war. {{dubious|date=November 2018}} {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In the [[Soviet Union]], radio would be heavily utilized by the state to broadcast political speeches by leadership. These broadcasts would very rarely have any additional editorial content or analysis, setting them apart from modern news reporting.<ref>Stephen Lovell, \"Broadcasting Bolshevik: The radio voice of Soviet culture, 1920s\u20131950s.\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 48.1 (2013): 78\u201397.</ref> The radio would however soon be eclipsed by [[broadcast television]] starting in the 1950s.\n\n=== Television ===\n{{Main|News broadcasting}}\nStarting in the 1940s, [[United States]] broadcast television channels would air 10-to-15-minute segments of news programming one or two times per evening. The era of live-TV news coverage would begin in the 1960s with the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], broadcast and reported to live on a variety of nationally syndicated television channels. During the 60s and 70s, television channels would begin adding regular morning or midday news shows. Starting in 1980 with the establishment of [[CNN]], news channels began providing 24-hour news coverage, a format which persists through today.\n\n=== Digital age ===\nThe role and status of journalism, as well as mass media, has undergone changes over the last two decades, together with the advancement of digital technology and publication of news on the [[Internet]]. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through [[e-readers]], [[smartphones]], and other electronic devices. News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nNotably, in the American media landscape, [[newsroom]]s have reduced their staff and coverage as traditional media channels, such as television, grappling with declining audiences. For example, between 2007 and 2012, [[CNN]] edited its story packages into nearly half of their original time length.<ref name=\"State\">\"[http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/overview-5/ \"The State of the News Media 2013: An Annual Report in American Journalism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826025836/http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/overview-5/ |date=26 August 2017 }}\", the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, 2 May 2012.

Using video camera-equipped smartphones, active citizens are now enabled to record footage of news events and upload them onto channels like [[YouTube]] (which is often discovered and used by mainstream news media outlets). News from a variety of online sources, like [[blogs]] and other social media, results in a wider choice of official and unofficial sources, rather than only traditional media organizations.\n\n[[File:Cosplayers at Comicdom 2012 in Athens, Greece grant interviews to the MTV television channel 21.JPG|thumb|Journalists interviewing a [[cosplay]]er]]\n\n==Professional and ethical standards==\n{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}\n\n[[File:News photographers and reporters wait outside Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' apartment.jpg|thumb|News photographers and reporters waiting behind a police line in [[New York City]], in May 1994]]\nWhile various existing codes have some differences, most share common elements including the principles of \u2013 [[truth]]fulness, [[accuracy]], [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]], impartiality, fairness and public accountability \u2013 as these apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fourth Estate \u2013 Core Journalism Principles, Standards and Practices|url=https://www.fourthestate.org/core-journalism-principles/|publisher=Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/status-of-journalists-and-journalism-ethics-ifj-principles IFJ (International Federation of Journalists) \u2013 Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114075747/http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/status-of-journalists-and-journalism-ethics-ifj-principles |date=14 November 2012 }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081130181610/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/060/151/2bcb53c-c641f97.doc DOC version)]\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/principl.htm |title=ASNE (American Society of Newspapers Editors) \u2013 Statement of Principles |accessdate=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605161914/http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/principl.htm |archivedate=5 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apme.com/ethics/ |title=APME (Associated Press Managing Editors) \u2013 Statement of Ethical Principles |date=2008-06-22 |accessdate=2013-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622123407/http://www.apme.com/ethics/ |archivedate=22 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp |title=(Society of Professional Journalists) \u2013 Code of Ethics |publisher=SPJ |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Kovach]] and Tom Rosenstiel propose several guidelines for journalists in their book ''The Elements of Journalism''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.org/node/72|title=The Elements of Journalism: What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect \u2013 Introduction &#124; Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ)|date=2006-06-19|publisher=Journalism.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002000433/http://www.journalism.org/node/72|archivedate=2 October 2013|accessdate=2013-02-23}}\n</ref>\nTheir view is that journalism's first loyalty is to the citizenry and that journalists are thus obliged to tell the truth and must serve as an independent monitor of powerful individuals and institutions within society.

This includes points like respecting people's privacy and ensuring accuracy. However, the Media Standards Trust has criticized the PCC, claiming it needs to be radically changed to secure the public trust of newspapers.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the media climate prior to the 20th century, where the media market was dominated by smaller newspapers and pamphleteers who usually had an overt and often radical agenda, with no presumption of balance or objectivity.\n\nBecause of the pressure on journalists to report news promptly and before their competitors, factual errors occur more frequently than in writing produced and edited under less time pressure. Thus a typical issue of a major daily newspaper may contain several corrections of articles published the previous day.  Perhaps the most famous journalistic mistake caused by time pressure was the [[Dewey Defeats Truman]] edition of the [[Chicago Daily Tribune]],  based on early election returns that failed to anticipate the actual result of the 1948 US presidential election.\n\n===Failing to uphold standards===\n{{Original research section|date=January 2015}}\nSuch a [[code of conduct]] can, in the real world, be difficult to uphold consistently. Reporting and editing do not occur in a vacuum but always reflect the political context in which journalists, no less than other citizens, operate.\n\nA news organization's budget inevitably reflects decision-making about what news to cover, for what audience, and in what depth. When budgets are cut, editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus, reduce the number of staff assigned to low-income areas, or wipe entire communities from the publication's zone of interest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nPublishers, owners and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a \"firewall\" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/bloomberg_news_and_the_problem.php|title=Bloomberg News and the problem of church-state separation|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Codes of ethics ===\nThere are over 242 codes of ethics in journalism that vary across various regions of the world.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|date=2016-03-01|title=Ethical convergence, divergence or communitas?

The second claim of justifiable consequences centers on weighing the benefits and detriments of a potentially harmful story and acting accordingly. An example of justifiable consequence is exposing a professional with dubious practices; on the other hand, acting within justifiable consequence means writing compassionately about a family in mourning.

Some governments guarantee the freedom of the press; while other nations severely restrict what journalists can research or publish.\n\nJournalists in many nations have some privileges that members of the general public do not, including better access to public events, crime scenes and press conferences, and to extended interviews with public officials, celebrities and others in the public eye.\n\nJournalists who elect to cover [[War|conflicts]], whether [[war]]s between nations or [[insurgency|insurgencies]] within nations, often give up any expectation of protection by government, if not giving up their rights to protection from the government. Journalists who are captured or detained during a conflict are expected to be treated as civilians and to be released to their national government. Many governments around the world target journalists for intimidation, harassment, and violence because of the nature of their work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Freedom Online|url=http://www.cpj.org/|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref>\n\n===Right to protect confidentiality of sources===\n{{Main|Protection of sources}}\n\nJournalists' interaction with sources sometimes involves [[confidentiality]], an extension of freedom of the press giving journalists a legal protection to keep the identity of a [[confidential informant]] private even when demanded by police or prosecutors; withholding their sources can land journalists in contempt of court, or in jail.\n\nIn the United States, there is no right to protect sources in a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] court. However, federal courts will refuse to force journalists to reveal their sources, unless the information the court seeks is highly relevant to the case and there's no other way to get it. State courts provide varying degrees of such protection. Journalists who refuse to testify even when ordered to can be found in [[contempt of court]] and fined or jailed. On the journalistic side of keeping sources confidential, there is also a risk to the journalist's credibility because there can be no actual confirmation of whether the information is valid. As such it is highly discouraged for journalists to have confidential sources.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Citizen Journalism]]\n* [[Fourth Estate]]\n* [[Hallin's spheres]]\n* [[History of American newspapers]]\n* [[History of journalism]]\n* [[Journalism education]] and [[Journalism school]]\n* [[Journalism ethics and standards]]\n* [[Journalism genres]]\n* [[Lists of journalists]]\n* [[List of journalism awards]]\n* [[Non-profit journalism]]\n* [[Objectivity (journalism)]]\n* [[Sensor journalism]]\n* [[Sports journalism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Journalism reviews===\n* ''[[American Journalism Review]]''\n* ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''\n* ''[[Health News Review]]''\n* ''[[Ryerson Review of Journalism]]''\n\n====Academic journals====\n* ''[[Journalism Practice]]''\n* ''[[Journalism Studies]]''\n* ''[[Journalism (journal)]]''\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation|last=Harcup |first=Tony |title=Journalism: Principles and Practice |year=2009 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=978-1-84787-250-0 |oclc=280437077 |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]]}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kaltenbrunner, Andy and Matthias Karmasin and Daniela Kraus, eds. \"The Journalism Report V: Innovation and Transition\", Facultas, 2017\n* Quick, Amanda C. ed.
