They are known as one of the late 1960s' first [[Supergroup (music)|supergroups]] and found success on both sides of the Atlantic with such songs as \"Black Coffee\", \"[[30 Days in the Hole]]\", \"[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]\" and \"[[Natural Born Bugie]]\". The original band line-up featured lead vocalist and guitarist [[Steve Marriott]] from [[Small Faces]], vocalist and guitarist [[Peter Frampton]] from [[The Herd (British band)|The Herd]], former [[Spooky Tooth]] bassist [[Greg Ridley]] and a 17-year-old drummer, [[Jerry Shirley]], from [[The Apostolic Intervention]].\n\n==1969\u20131970: Formation and chart success==\n\nIn January 1969 Steve Marriott, having just left [[Small Faces]], got together with Greg Ridley, Peter Frampton and Jerry Shirley. Marriott had brought together Shirley and Ridley as a possible band for Frampton, then ended up joining the band himself. They chose the name Humble Pie and were signed to [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]'s record label [[Immediate Records]]. Their debut album, ''[[As Safe as Yesterday Is]]'', was released in August, 1969, along with the single, \"[[Natural Born Bugie]]\", which reached No. 4 [[chart-topper|hit]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]]; the album peaked at No. 16 in the UK album charts. ''As Safe as Yesterday Is'' was one of the first albums to be described by the term \"heavy metal\" in a 1970 review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref>Saunders, Mike. ''[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/312133/review/5943267/as_safe_as_yesterday_is Rolling Stone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112065633/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/312133/review/5943267/as_safe_as_yesterday_is |date=12 January 2010 }}'' 12 November 1970</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/11/label-love-immediate-records|work=The Guardian|title=Label of love: Immediate Records|date=11 May 2009 |author=Owen Adams}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Town and Country (album)|Town and Country]]'' released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of the US.  This album featured a more [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound and songs written by all four members. Humble Pie concerts at this time featured an acoustic set, with a radical re-working of Graham Gouldman's \"[[For Your Love]]\" as its centrepiece followed by an electric set. Recent tape archives show that the band recorded around 30 songs in its first nine months of existence, many of which remained unreleased for decades, including an interpretation of [[Henry Glover]]'s \"[[Drown in My Own Tears]]\".\n\n==1970\u20131971: Early success==\nDuring 1970, Humble Pie switched to [[A&M Records]] and [[Dee Anthony]] became their manager. Anthony was focused on the US market and discarded the acoustic set, instigating a more raucous sound with Marriott as the front man. The group's first album for A&M, ''[[Humble Pie (album)|Humble Pie]]'', was released later that year and alternated between [[progressive rock]] and [[hard rock]]. A single, \"[[Big Black Dog]]\", was released to coincide with the album and failed to chart, however the band was becoming known for popular live rock shows in the US.\n\nIt was during this period that Peter Frampton acquired his famed \"Phenix\" guitar, the black 1954 Les Paul Custom which became his signature instrument and his favourite guitar for the next decade. Humble Pie was playing a run of shows at the Fillmore West in San Francisco in early December 1970, and during the first show Frampton was plagued by sound problems with his then-current guitar, a semi-acoustic Gibson 335, which was prone to unwanted feedback at higher volumes. After the show he was approached by fan and musician Mark Mariana, who loaned him a modified 1954 Gibson Les Paul, and by the end of the second show Frampton had become so enamoured of the guitar that he offered to buy it on the spot, but Mariana refused payment. Frampton played it almost exclusively for the next ten years. It was featured on the cover of ''[[Frampton Comes Alive]]'' and was thought to have been destroyed in 1980 when a plane carrying Frampton's stage equipment crashed in Venezuela during a South American tour, killing the crew, but with the guitar in fact surviving the accident with some minor damage. It was eventually returned to Frampton in 2011.\n\nOn 9 July 1971, Humble Pie opened for [[Grand Funk Railroad]] at their historical Shea Stadium concert, an event that broke the Beatles record for fastest selling stadium concert, to that date. Also in 1971 Humble Pie released their most successful record to date ''[[Rock On (Humble Pie album)|Rock On]]'' as well as a live album recorded at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York entitled ''[[Performance Rockin' the Fillmore]]''. The live album reached No. 21 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold by the [[RIAA]]. \"[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]\" was a FM radio hit in the US peaking at No. 73 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], propelling the album up the charts. But Frampton left the band by the time the album was released and went on to enjoy success as a solo artist.\n\n==1971\u20131975: Clem Clempson, The Blackberries and further success==\n[[File:Humble Pie 1972 performance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Clem Clempson (rear left) and Marriott in a 1972 performance with Humble Pie]]\n\nFrampton was replaced by [[Clem Clempson]] and Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasising Marriott's blues and soul roots. Their first record with Clempson, ''[[Smokin' (Humble Pie album)|Smokin']]'', was released in 1972, along with two singles \"[[Hot 'n' Nasty]]\"  and \"[[30 Days in the Hole]]\" (the latter of which became one of their best-known efforts).  It was the band's most commercially successful record, and reached No. 6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. After the success of ''Smokin''' the band's record label [[A&M Records|A&M]] released Humble Pie's first two Immediate albums in one [[double album]], as ''Lost and Found''. The marketing ploy was a success and the album charted at No. 37 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nLooking for a more authentic [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] sound, Marriott hired three female backing vocalists, The Blackberries.  The trio consisted of [[Venetta Fields]], [[Clydie King]] and [[Sherlie Matthews]] who was later replaced by Billie Barnum. They had performed with Ike and Tina Turner as [[The Ikettes]] and with [[Ray Charles]] as The Raelettes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humble-pie.net/the_blackberries/html/the_blackberries2.html |title=The Complete Blackberries.

The album peaked at No. 13 in the US charts. ''[[Thunderbox (album)|Thunderbox]]'' was released in 1974, and ''[[Street Rats]]'' a year later. In 1975, Humble Pie conducted their Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.\n\n==1979\u20131981: Steve Marriott's Humble Pie without Frampton and Ridley==\nIn late 1979, Marriott and Shirley revived Humble Pie, adding [[Bobby Tench]],<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\">{{cite book |last=Muise |first=Dan |title=Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |pages=134, 147, 148}}</ref> former vocalist and guitarist from [[The Jeff Beck Group]], along with bassist [[Sooty Jones|Anthony \"Sooty\" Jones]] from New York. They submitted  \"Fool for a Pretty Face\", a song Marriott and Shirley had just written, to record labels. They secured a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] and in the UK their material was released by [[Jet Records]], owned by former [[Small Faces]] manager [[Don Arden]]. They recorded the album ''[[On to Victory (album)|On to Victory]]'' (1980), and \"Fool for a Pretty Face\" reached No. 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100. ''On to Victory'' peaked at No. 60 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Humble Pie toured the US as part of the 'Rock 'N' Roll Marathon Bill' with [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Aerosmith]] and also recorded the album ''[[Go for the Throat]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\" /> This album was originally recorded by the band as a raw-edged [[Rhythm and Blues]] album, but their record company wanted a slicker album.<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\" /> In April 1981, at the beginning of the promotional tour for the ''Go for the Throat'' album, Marriott crushed his hand in a hotel room door, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a [[duodenal ulcer]] forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates in July 1981. Soon afterwards this line-up disbanded,<ref name=\"Humble Pie, Hewitt Hellier\">{{cite book |last1=Hewitt |last2=Hellier |title=[[Steve Marriott - All Too Beautiful...]] |page=248}}</ref> due to contractual differences.<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\" />\n\n==1982: Steve Marriott forms a new band billed as Humble Pie==\nIn 1982 Marriott was back on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] keyboardist [[Goldy McJohn]] and Chicago-born drummer Fallon Williams III. This grouping was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie, but ended up billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed as [[Small Faces]] to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at U.S. Immigration and was deported back to England.\n\nMarriott based himself in the [[Atlanta, Georgia]], area, where his second wife Pamela Stephens was from and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from [[The Brains]]) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. After a deal with [[Capricorn Records]] fell through due to the label ceasing to trade, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to record three songs, intended for an album which didn't materialise. Following Johnson leaving and being replaced by Phil Dix, they were scheduled to record demos with Yes and ELP producer [[Eddy Offord]] at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards of [[Georgia Satellites]] as the new guitarist. Before recording sessions began, Rick and Keith left the band. The recordings were finished with Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (from [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]]) on bass, but failed to attract a record label. Marriott disbanded the band and returned to England in late 1983.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Uli Twelker |author2=Roland Schmitt|title=The Small Faces & Other Stories |edition=2nd |publisher=Bobcat Books |isbn=978-0-85712-451-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1d6aAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT286&lpg=PT286&dq}}</ref>\n\n==1988\u20132000: Jerry Shirley's Humble Pie, new Marriott and Frampton songs==\nJerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1988 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called New Humble Pie or Humble Pie featuring Jerry Shirley, where Shirley was the only original member. The band began performing concerts and was based in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where Shirley was working as an on-air radio personality at Cleveland's [[WNCX]].

In August 1999 Shirley was seriously injured in an auto accident and later returned to England.<ref name=\"shirley humble pie\"/>\n\nFrampton and Marriott started collaborating again in 1990. Two songs from this collaboration, \"The Bigger They Come\" and \"I Won't Let You Down\", with Steve Marriott's vocals, appeared on Frampton's album ''Shine On: A Collection''. Marriott died in a house fire on 20 April 1991.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annual Obituary (1991).

Rick Craig of [[Halloween (metal band)|Halloween]], alternating bassists [[Ean Evans]] of [[The Outlaws (band)|The Outlaws]] joined the line up with Kent \"Bubba\" Gascoyne and Jamie Darnell alternating on drums. Michigan guitarist Patrick Thomas took Craig's place later that year. After completing touring duties they disbanded and Huhn went on to join [[Foghat]].\n\nHaving returned to the U.K, Shirley re-formed Humble Pie in 2001 with a line-up including the original bassist Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie member vocalist and guitarist [[Bobby Tench]] and new rhythm guitarist [[Dave Colwell]] (of [[Bad Company]]). They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Back on Track (Humble Pie album)|Back on Track]]'' (2002), which comprised new songs and was released by [[Sanctuary Records]].<ref>{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p4527 | tab = biography | label = Biography of Humble Pie | first = Jason | last = Ankeny | accessdate = 2 March 2010 }}</ref> Keyboard players [[Zoot Money]] and Victor Martin were brought in for recording sessions.

They are known as one of the late 1960s' first [[Supergroup (music)|supergroups]] and found success on both sides of the Atlantic with such songs as \"Black Coffee\", \"[[30 Days in the Hole]]\", \"[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]\" and \"[[Natural Born Bugie]]\". The original band line-up featured lead vocalist and guitarist [[Steve Marriott]] from [[Small Faces]], vocalist and guitarist [[Peter Frampton]] from [[The Herd (British band)|The Herd]], former [[Spooky Tooth]] bassist [[Greg Ridley]] and a 17-year-old drummer, [[Jerry Shirley]], from [[The Apostolic Intervention]].\n\n==1969\u20131970: Formation and chart success==\n\nIn January 1969 Steve Marriott, having just left [[Small Faces]], got together with Greg Ridley, Peter Frampton and Jerry Shirley. Marriott had brought together Shirley and Ridley as a possible band for Frampton, then ended up joining the band himself. They chose the name Humble Pie and were signed to [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]'s record label [[Immediate Records]]. Their debut album, ''[[As Safe as Yesterday Is]]'', was released in August, 1969, along with the single, \"[[Natural Born Bugie]]\", which reached No. 4 [[chart-topper|hit]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]]; the album peaked at No. 16 in the UK album charts. ''As Safe as Yesterday Is'' was one of the first albums to be described by the term \"heavy metal\" in a 1970 review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref>Saunders, Mike. ''[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/312133/review/5943267/as_safe_as_yesterday_is Rolling Stone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112065633/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/312133/review/5943267/as_safe_as_yesterday_is |date=12 January 2010 }}'' 12 November 1970</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/11/label-love-immediate-records|work=The Guardian|title=Label of love: Immediate Records|date=11 May 2009 |author=Owen Adams}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Town and Country (album)|Town and Country]]'' released in the UK during 1969 while the band was away on its first tour of the US.  This album featured a more [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound and songs written by all four members. Humble Pie concerts at this time featured an acoustic set, with a radical re-working of Graham Gouldman's \"[[For Your Love]]\" as its centrepiece followed by an electric set. Recent tape archives show that the band recorded around 30 songs in its first nine months of existence, many of which remained unreleased for decades, including an interpretation of [[Henry Glover]]'s \"[[Drown in My Own Tears]]\".\n\n==1970\u20131971: Early success==\nDuring 1970, Humble Pie switched to [[A&M Records]] and [[Dee Anthony]] became their manager. Anthony was focused on the US market and discarded the acoustic set, instigating a more raucous sound with Marriott as the front man. The group's first album for A&M, ''[[Humble Pie (album)|Humble Pie]]'', was released later that year and alternated between [[progressive rock]] and [[hard rock]]. A single, \"[[Big Black Dog]]\", was released to coincide with the album and failed to chart, however the band was becoming known for popular live rock shows in the US.\n\nIt was during this period that Peter Frampton acquired his famed \"Phenix\" guitar, the black 1954 Les Paul Custom which became his signature instrument and his favourite guitar for the next decade. Humble Pie was playing a run of shows at the Fillmore West in San Francisco in early December 1970, and during the first show Frampton was plagued by sound problems with his then-current guitar, a semi-acoustic Gibson 335, which was prone to unwanted feedback at higher volumes. After the show he was approached by fan and musician Mark Mariana, who loaned him a modified 1954 Gibson Les Paul, and by the end of the second show Frampton had become so enamoured of the guitar that he offered to buy it on the spot, but Mariana refused payment. Frampton played it almost exclusively for the next ten years. It was featured on the cover of ''[[Frampton Comes Alive]]'' and was thought to have been destroyed in 1980 when a plane carrying Frampton's stage equipment crashed in Venezuela during a South American tour, killing the crew, but with the guitar in fact surviving the accident with some minor damage. It was eventually returned to Frampton in 2011.\n\nOn 9 July 1971, Humble Pie opened for [[Grand Funk Railroad]] at their historical Shea Stadium concert, an event that broke the Beatles record for fastest selling stadium concert, to that date. Also in 1971 Humble Pie released their most successful record to date ''[[Rock On (Humble Pie album)|Rock On]]'' as well as a live album recorded at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York entitled ''[[Performance Rockin' the Fillmore]]''. The live album reached No. 21 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold by the [[RIAA]]. \"[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]\" was a FM radio hit in the US peaking at No. 73 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], propelling the album up the charts. But Frampton left the band by the time the album was released and went on to enjoy success as a solo artist.\n\n==1971\u20131975: Clem Clempson, The Blackberries and further success==\n[[File:Humble Pie 1972 performance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Clem Clempson (rear left) and Marriott in a 1972 performance with Humble Pie]]\n\nFrampton was replaced by [[Clem Clempson]] and Humble Pie moved towards a harder sound emphasising Marriott's blues and soul roots. Their first record with Clempson, ''[[Smokin' (Humble Pie album)|Smokin']]'', was released in 1972, along with two singles \"[[Hot 'n' Nasty]]\"  and \"[[30 Days in the Hole]]\" (the latter of which became one of their best-known efforts).  It was the band's most commercially successful record, and reached No. 6 on the US charts, helped by a busy touring schedule. After the success of ''Smokin''' the band's record label [[A&M Records|A&M]] released Humble Pie's first two Immediate albums in one [[double album]], as ''Lost and Found''. The marketing ploy was a success and the album charted at No. 37 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nLooking for a more authentic [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] sound, Marriott hired three female backing vocalists, The Blackberries.  The trio consisted of [[Venetta Fields]], [[Clydie King]] and [[Sherlie Matthews]] who was later replaced by Billie Barnum. They had performed with Ike and Tina Turner as [[The Ikettes]] and with [[Ray Charles]] as The Raelettes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humble-pie.net/the_blackberries/html/the_blackberries2.html |title=The Complete Blackberries.

The album peaked at No. 13 in the US charts. ''[[Thunderbox (album)|Thunderbox]]'' was released in 1974, and ''[[Street Rats]]'' a year later. In 1975, Humble Pie conducted their Goodbye Pie Tour before disbanding.\n\n==1979\u20131981: Steve Marriott's Humble Pie without Frampton and Ridley==\nIn late 1979, Marriott and Shirley revived Humble Pie, adding [[Bobby Tench]],<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\">{{cite book |last=Muise |first=Dan |title=Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |pages=134, 147, 148}}</ref> former vocalist and guitarist from [[The Jeff Beck Group]], along with bassist [[Sooty Jones|Anthony \"Sooty\" Jones]] from New York. They submitted  \"Fool for a Pretty Face\", a song Marriott and Shirley had just written, to record labels. They secured a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] and in the UK their material was released by [[Jet Records]], owned by former [[Small Faces]] manager [[Don Arden]]. They recorded the album ''[[On to Victory (album)|On to Victory]]'' (1980), and \"Fool for a Pretty Face\" reached No. 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100. ''On to Victory'' peaked at No. 60 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Humble Pie toured the US as part of the 'Rock 'N' Roll Marathon Bill' with [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Aerosmith]] and also recorded the album ''[[Go for the Throat]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\" /> This album was originally recorded by the band as a raw-edged [[Rhythm and Blues]] album, but their record company wanted a slicker album.<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\" /> In April 1981, at the beginning of the promotional tour for the ''Go for the Throat'' album, Marriott crushed his hand in a hotel room door, delaying earlier scheduled appearances by the band, and he later developed a [[duodenal ulcer]] forcing the cancellation of all further tour dates in July 1981. Soon afterwards this line-up disbanded,<ref name=\"Humble Pie, Hewitt Hellier\">{{cite book |last1=Hewitt |last2=Hellier |title=[[Steve Marriott - All Too Beautiful...]] |page=248}}</ref> due to contractual differences.<ref name=\"Bobby Tench Humble Pie\" />\n\n==1982: Steve Marriott forms a new band billed as Humble Pie==\nIn 1982 Marriott was back on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] keyboardist [[Goldy McJohn]] and Chicago-born drummer Fallon Williams III. This grouping was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie, but ended up billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed as [[Small Faces]] to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at U.S. Immigration and was deported back to England.\n\nMarriott based himself in the [[Atlanta, Georgia]], area, where his second wife Pamela Stephens was from and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from [[The Brains]]) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. After a deal with [[Capricorn Records]] fell through due to the label ceasing to trade, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to record three songs, intended for an album which didn't materialise. Following Johnson leaving and being replaced by Phil Dix, they were scheduled to record demos with Yes and ELP producer [[Eddy Offord]] at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards of [[Georgia Satellites]] as the new guitarist. Before recording sessions began, Rick and Keith left the band. The recordings were finished with Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (from [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]]) on bass, but failed to attract a record label. Marriott disbanded the band and returned to England in late 1983.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Uli Twelker |author2=Roland Schmitt|title=The Small Faces & Other Stories |edition=2nd |publisher=Bobcat Books |isbn=978-0-85712-451-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1d6aAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT286&lpg=PT286&dq}}</ref>\n\n==1988\u20132000: Jerry Shirley's Humble Pie, new Marriott and Frampton songs==\nJerry Shirley obtained the rights to the name Humble Pie in 1988 and reformed the group with different musicians. This project was called New Humble Pie or Humble Pie featuring Jerry Shirley, where Shirley was the only original member. The band began performing concerts and was based in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where Shirley was working as an on-air radio personality at Cleveland's [[WNCX]]. The line-up included vocalist [[Charlie Huhn]], who also played lead and rhythm guitar.

In August 1999 Shirley was seriously injured in an auto accident and later returned to England.<ref name=\"shirley humble pie\"/>\n\nFrampton and Marriott started collaborating again in 1990. Two songs from this collaboration, \"The Bigger They Come\" and \"I Won't Let You Down\", with Steve Marriott's vocals, appeared on Frampton's album ''Shine On: A Collection''. Marriott died in a house fire on 20 April 1991.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annual Obituary (1991).

Rick Craig of [[Halloween (metal band)|Halloween]], alternating bassists [[Ean Evans]] of [[The Outlaws (band)|The Outlaws]] joined the line up with Kent \"Bubba\" Gascoyne and Jamie Darnell alternating on drums. Michigan guitarist Patrick Thomas took Craig's place later that year. After completing touring duties they disbanded and Huhn went on to join [[Foghat]].\n\nHaving returned to the U.K, Shirley re-formed Humble Pie in 2001 with a line-up including the original bassist Greg Ridley, former Humble Pie member vocalist and guitarist [[Bobby Tench]] and new rhythm guitarist [[Dave Colwell]] (of [[Bad Company]]). They recorded Humble Pie's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Back on Track (Humble Pie album)|Back on Track]]'' (2002), which comprised new songs and was released by [[Sanctuary Records]].<ref>{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p4527 | tab = biography | label = Biography of Humble Pie | first = Jason | last = Ankeny | accessdate = 2 March 2010 }}</ref> Keyboard players [[Zoot Money]] and Victor Martin were brought in for recording sessions. A brief tour of UK and Germany with [[Company of Snakes]] followed with new keyboardist Dean Rees. But Ridley fell ill late in 2002 and the band split up.\n\nShirley appeared at the Steve Marriott Tribute Concert held at the [[London Astoria]] in 2001, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marriott's death.

It was released on November 5, 2001 in the United States through [[Jive Records]]. Looking to transition from the [[teen pop]] styles of her earlier albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Spears began to embrace a significantly more mature sound with ''Britney''. Its music incorporates genres of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with influences of [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and occasionally dips into elements of [[disco]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[electronica]]. Its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]].<ref name=\"Credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300/credits|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears: Credits|publisher=Allmusic.

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 745,750 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three studio albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003).

It was released on November 5, 2001 in the United States through [[Jive Records]]. Looking to transition from the [[teen pop]] styles of her earlier albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Spears began to embrace a significantly more mature sound with ''Britney''. Its music incorporates genres of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with influences of [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and occasionally dips into elements of [[disco]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[electronica]]. Its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]].<ref name=\"Credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300/credits|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears: Credits|publisher=Allmusic.

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 745,750 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three studio albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on her fourth concert tour, the [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], which began in November 2001 and continued until July 2002. The album received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]] (2003).<ref name=\"Nominations\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Complete-list-of-Grammy-nominees-ceremony-set-2687689.php|title=Complete list of Grammy nominees; ceremony set for Feb. 23|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=January 8, 2003|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix singles were released from the album. \"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\" reached the top ten in several countries but reached only number twenty-seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Spears's first lead single not to peak within the top ten of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"[[Overprotected]]\" and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" had alternated as the second and third single of the album, respectively, both of which performed similarly internationally by reaching top ten in several countries, while the [[Darkchild]]  remix of the former peaked at number eighty-six on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\", as well as the following singles \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll#Britney Spears version|I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\", \"[[Anticipating]]\" (which was released exclusively in France) and \"[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]\" didn't chart on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100; however all of them except for \"Anticipating\" reached the top ten in several countries albeit in less than its preceding singles.

It's time to re-educate the new generation about what pop really is: a collection of sounds and genres. How you mix it all together is what makes pop music interesting -- and popular.</blockquote>\n\nThe group enlisted [[BT (musician)|BT]] after [[Justin Timberlake]] heard \"The Hip Hop Phenomenon\", taken from the UK version of his 1999 album, ''[[Movement in Still Life]]'' <ref name=\"RSPop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/n-sync-true-tales-of-the-pop-life-236982/|title='N Sync: True Tales of the Pop Life|author=Tour\u00e9|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 31, 2001|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> BT agreed to produce the track on the request that he \"treat your vocals so irreverently, it\u2019s not even funny\".<ref name=\"RSPop\"/> While the song was in production, BT heard Timberlake [[beatboxing]] under his breath, demanding him to use his vocals. Timberlake initially hesitated, as he didn't want it to be featured on any track, but relented as BT created four tracks using broken headphones.<ref name=\"RSPop\"/> After BT created over 1,200 edits of the track using [[Max Headroom]]-styled stutter-edits, he showed the song to Chasez and Timberlake, who immediately loved it.<ref name=\"RSPop\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Pop\" was written by [[Wade Robson]] and Timberlake and produced by BT using his famous \"[[stutter edit]]\" sound.

After the music starts, the video takes place at a colorful [[Nightclub|disco club]] with NSYNC performing on a lighted circle with the word \"POP\" in a [[neon sign]] behind them. While they are singing, Timberlake is also on a spinning spiral, and [[JC Chasez]] is in the crowd. Many special effects, including fast-motion, bullet-time, and computer generated warp-transitions, are used. During the song's breakdown, the group perform an extended choreographed sequence, while they are seen in various outfits.

After the music starts, the video takes place at a colorful [[Nightclub|disco club]] with NSYNC performing on a lighted circle with the word \"POP\" in a [[neon sign]] behind them. While they are singing, Timberlake is also on a spinning spiral, and [[JC Chasez]] is in the crowd. Many special effects, including fast-motion, bullet-time, and computer generated warp-transitions, are used.

Do their spirits rise up and praise you?</blockquote>\n\nOthers passages mentioning Sheol include {{bibleref2|1 Samuel 2:6}}; {{bibleref2|2 Samuel 22:5-19}}; {{bibleref2|Job 10:18-22}}; {{bibleref2|Psalm 30:3; 94:17; 143:3; 115:17}}; {{bibleref2|Jonah 2:3-8}}, and others.\n\n===New Testament===\nIn the New Testament there are also passages describing Hades, such as the story of the [[rich man and Lazarus]] and {{bibleref2|Luke 16:19-31}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barzakh]]\n* [[Biblical cosmology]]\n* [[Christian views on Hades]]\n* [[Eirene (goddess)]]\n* [[Hel (being)]]\n* [[Hellenistic Judaism]]\n* [[Limbo#Limbo of the Patriarchs|Limbo of the Patriarchs]]\n* [[Shalim]]\n* [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)]]\n* [[Tartarus]]\n* [[Xibalba]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n| last1       = Aune\n| first1      = David E.\n| authorlink  =\n| title       = Westminster Dictionary of the New Testament and Early Christian Literature\n| chapter     = Cosmology\n| editor1-last       =\n| editor1-first      =\n| editor2-last       =\n| editor2-first      =\n| year       = 2003\n| publisher  = Westminster John Knox Press\n| isbn       =9780664219178\n| chapter-url        = https://books.google.com/?id=nhhdJ-fkywYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dictionary+New+Testament#v=onepage&q=cosmology&f=false\n| ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last       = Bernstein\n| first      = Alan E.\n| authorlink =\n| title      = The Formation of Hell: Death and Retribution in the Ancient and Early Christian Worlds\n| year       = 1996\n| publisher  = Cornell University Press\n| isbn       =978-0801481314\n| url        = https://books.google.com/?id=y8wAdna_YY0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+formation+of+Hell#v=onepage&q=The%20formation%20of%20Hell&f=false\n| ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n| last = Brichto\n| first = Herbert Chanan\n| year = 1973\n| title = Kin, Cult, Land and Afterlife \u2013 A Biblical Complex\n| journal = Hebrew Union College Annual\n| volume = 44\n| ref = harv\n| jstor = 23506813\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last1       = Hess\n| first1      = Richard S.\n| authorlink  =\n| title       = Israelite Religions: An Archeological and Biblical Survey\n|chapter      =\n| editor1-last       =\n| editor1-first      =\n| editor2-last       =\n| editor2-first      =\n| editor3-last       =\n| editor3-first      =\n| year       = 2007\n| publisher  = Baker Academic Press\n| isbn       =9781441201126\n| url        = https://books.google.com/?id=2jNoqNRDYDUC&pg=PA161&dq=Zion+Zaphon#v=onepage&q=Zion%20Zaphon&f=false\n| ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last1       = Kelly\n| first1      = Henry A.\n| authorlink  =\n| title       = Hell and Its Afterlife: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives\n| chapter     = Hell with Purgatory and two Limbos\n| editor1-last       = Moreira\n| editor1-first      = Isabel\n| editor2-last       = Toscano\n| editor2-first      = Margaret\n| year       = 2010\n| publisher  = Ashgate Publishing\n| isbn       =9780754667292\n| chapter-url        = https://books.google.com/?id=H04CJvW58agC&pg=PA121&dq=Hell+with+Purgatory+and+two+Limbos#v=onepage&q=Hell%20with%20Purgatory%20and%20two%20Limbos&f=false\n| ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last1       = Knobel\n| first1      = Peter\n| authorlink  =\n| title       = The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion\n| chapter     = Death\n| editor1-last       = Berlin\n| editor1-first      = Adele\n| editor2-last       = Grossman\n| editor2-first      = Maxine\n| year       = 2011\n| publisher  = Oxford University Press\n| isbn       =9780199730049\n| chapter-url        = https://books.google.com/?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&pg=PA189&dq=Bible+Cosmology#v=onepage&q=Bible%20Cosmology&f=false\n| ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last1       = Longenecker\n| first1      = Richard N.\n| authorlink  = Richard N.
