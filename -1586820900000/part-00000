Her father, believing that the game led to demon worship, refused to let her play and hid it away. She became fascinated by the game as a result, and a pattern ensued where she would find it and play, and her father would hide it again. At the same time, she and her father watched episodes of ''[[Star Trek]]'' together. These two factors early in her life helped to develop an interest in both role-playing games and science fiction.<ref name=gw>{{cite web | url =https://www.guildwarsinsider.com/2012/01/guild-wars-insider-interview-ree-soesbee | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120115014222/https://www.guildwarsinsider.com/2012/01/guild-wars-insider-interview-ree-soesbee | archivedate =2012-01-15 | title =Guild Wars Insider Interview With Ree Soesbee |  date =2012-01-11 | website =Guild Wars Insider | access-date =2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\nShe continued to play various role-playing games through her childhood and early adulthood, including ''[[Cyberpunk (role-playing game)|Cyberpunk]]'', ''[[Shadowrun]]'', and ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]''.<ref name=gw />\n\n==Writer==\nSoesbee completed her MA in English Literature at [[UNC-Chapel Hill]] in North Carolina, writing her thesis on ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''.<ref name=gw />\n\nWhile she was working on her doctoral thesis about [[Edo period]] literature, she started to write short fiction stories based on the ''[[Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game]]''. She submitted some of them to the game's publisher, [[Alderac Entertainment Group]] (AEG), and she was subsequently asked to write a sourcebook for the game, ''Way of the Crane''. She completed that as freelance work while still working on her thesis. AEG then asked her to join their staff full-time to work on more sourcebooks as well as the ''[[Legend of the Five Rings (collectible card game)|Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game]]'' (CCG) that was being developed. She subsequently made the decision to leave school without finishing her thesis.<ref name=gw />\n\n==Alderac Entertainment Group==\nOne of her first projects at AEG was to help her roommate Kevin Millard design the CCG ''[[Warlock (card game)|Warlock]]''.<ref name=gw />  She also provided material for various ''Legend of the Five Rings'' projects including the adventure ''Code of the Bushido'' (1998), and ''The Book of the Shadowlands'' (1998).\n\nShe was also a contributor to sourcebooks and adventures for other role-playing games, including\n* ''The Way of Kolinar'' (1999), a sourcebook for the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game]]'' (Wizards of the Coast)\n* ''7th Sea Gamemaster Guide'' (1999), and ''7th Sea Players Handbook'' (2000), for the ''[[7th Sea (role-playing game)|7th Sea]]'' RPG (AEG)\n* ''Clanbook: Tremere'' (2000) for ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' ([[White Wolf Publishing]])\n* ''Adventure II'' (2004), a revision of an older anthology of [[d20 System]] scenarios (AEG)\n\nOn her own, Soesbee also designed a number of different projects:\n* ''Jerimond's Orb'' (2000), a generic d20 System adventure (AEG)\n* ''Blood on White Petals'' (2001), a d20 System \"mini-module\" in a medieval Japanese setting (AEG)\n* ''Aztecs: Empire of the Burning Sun'' (2002), a d20 System campaign set in the [[Aztec Empire]] ([[Avalanche Press]])\n\nIn 2000, AEG decided to publish a series of seven ''Clan War'' novels based on ''Legend of Five Rings'', and Soesbee was asked to write two of them, ''The Crane'' (2000) and ''The Dragon'' (2001).

The port only has a small basin which is occasionally used to provide water to the companies located at the [[Cassella]] Industrial Park.\n* [[Frankfurt Osthafen|Osthafen]] is the biggest port in Frankfurt and almost working at full capacity. It consists of the ''Oberhafen (Upper Harbour)'' and the ''Unterhafen'' ''(Lower Harbour)'' which are separated from each other by the [[Offenbach Barrage]]. Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the ''S\u00fcdbecken'' (southern basin).\n* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Br\u00fccke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[St\u00e4del Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.\n* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] \u2014 a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreik\u00f6nigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.\n* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The neighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.\n* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.\n* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.\n* The [[H\u00f6chster Hafen]] below the [[H\u00f6chster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.\n* At the [[H\u00f6chst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[mittlere Werksbr\u00fcck]]e and the [[Leunabr\u00fccke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.\n\nCargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods. By 2006, the figures had fallen to 5516 ships with approx. 3.5 million tonnes of goods handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/d438f2d4342749469924a1947109c1da.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> The decline in bulk goods such as coal, gravel and scrap metal plays a major role in this.

Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbr\u00fccke]] crosses over the ''S\u00fcdbecken'' (southern basin).\n* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Br\u00fccke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[St\u00e4del Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.\n* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] \u2014 a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreik\u00f6nigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.\n* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The neighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.\n* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.\n* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.\n* The [[H\u00f6chster Hafen]] below the [[H\u00f6chster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.\n* At the [[H\u00f6chst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[Mittlere Werksbr\u00fcck|mittlere Werksbr\u00fccke]] and the [[Leunabr\u00fccke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.\n\nCargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods. By 2006, the figures had fallen to 5516 ships with approx. 3.5 million tonnes of goods handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/d438f2d4342749469924a1947109c1da.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> The decline in bulk goods such as coal, gravel and scrap metal plays a major role in this.

Nicholl was sent to [[Exeter]] to warn his colleagues this was unacceptable, and no further agreements should be made. In May, he was present at the [[Battle of Stratton]], a Royalist victory that ensured their control of the [[West Country]]. Nicholl's estates were occupied until the end of the war, and in June 1645, he received financial support from Parliament.{{sfn|Fuller-Eliott-Drake|1911|p=335}} \n\nHis close friend [[John Hampden]] died of wounds received at [[Battle_of_Chalgrove_Field|Chalgrove Field]] in June.

In July 1647, he was one of the [[Eleven Members]] impeached by [[Grandee#Grandee_(New_Model_Army)|senior Army officers]] of attempting to destabilise the kingdom.

Following new elections in November 1640, he became MP for [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]], in the 1640 to 1660 [[Long Parliament]].{{sfn|Willis|1750|pp=229-239}}\n\nJohn Pym nominated him as a Parliamentary observer at the trial of [[Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford|Strafford]] in March 1641.{{sfn|Duffin|2008}} When the [[First English Civil War]] began in August 1642, unlike many of the Cornish gentry, the Nicholls backed [[Roundhead|Parliament]].{{sfn|Thrush, Ferris|2010}} In September 1642, [[Francis Bassett]], the Royalist [[High_Sheriff_of_Cornwall|Sheriff of Cornwall]], expelled them and other supporters from the county.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p=157}} \n\nIn February 1643, Parliamentarians in Cornwall and Devon agreed a local truce with their Royalist opponents, causing outrage in London. Nicholl was sent to [[Exeter]] to warn his colleagues this was unacceptable, and no further agreements should be made. In May, he was present at the [[Battle of Stratton]], a Royalist victory that ensured their control of the [[West Country]]. Nicholl's estates were occupied until the end of the war, and in June 1645, he received financial support from Parliament.{{sfn|Fuller-Eliott-Drake|1911|p=335}} \n\nHis close friend [[John Hampden]] died of wounds received at [[Battle_of_Chalgrove_Field|Chalgrove Field]] in June. Nicholl wrote; \u2018Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and more faithful friend.\u2019{{sfn|Adair|1979|p=17}} His uncle John Pym died in December, while [[Henry_Grey,_1st_Earl_of_Stamford|Stamford]], Parliamentary commander at Stratton, filed charges against Nicholl, claiming  blamed for his defeat. However, Nicholl successfully refuted these, and they were dismissed in May 1644.{{sfn|Hopper|2008}}   \n\nIn the political struggle that followed the end of the war in June 1646, he was a leader of the Parliamentary opposition to [[Oliver Cromwell]]. In July 1647, he was one of the [[Eleven Members]] impeached by [[Grandee#Grandee_(New_Model_Army)|senior Army officers]] of attempting to destabilise the kingdom. The Eleven withdrew from Parliament; unlike some of his colleagues, Nicholl received a pass to Cornwall, rather than abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eleven Members |url=http://bcw-project.org/church-and-state/second-civil-war/eleven-members |website=BCW Project |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nArrested on 17 August on his way home, he was taken to [[New Model Army]] headquarters in [[Kingston upon Thames]], but quietly allowed to escape a few days later. Parliamentary proceedings to impeach the Eleven Members were suspended when the [[Second English Civil War]] began in February, then abandoned in June. As a gesture of reconciliation, Nicholl was given the [[sinecure]] of [[Royal Armouries|Master of the Armoury]].{{sfn|Fuller-Eliott-Drake|1911|p=366}}  \n\nDefeat in the Second English Civil War broke the power of the Presbyterian opposition, and Nicholl was among those expelled by [[Pride's Purge]] in 1648. He later reconciled with the new regime; in 1654, he was returned as one of the MPs for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]], then re-elected in 1656. During the [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] from 1655 to 1657, he was one of 12 advisors for the South-West.{{sfn|Duffin|2008}} He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Cornwall]] in 1657, and provided regular updates to [[John Thurloe]], head of intelligence under the [[Protectorate]].{{sfn|Aylmer|1974|p=181}}\n\nIn February 1658, Nicholl died in London, and buried in the graveyard attached to the [[Savoy Chapel]].
