It is part of the grounds not open to the public. However, [[Edward Middleton Barry]], who also assisted with its landscaping, used railings rather than walls or fencing in its design, and it is can be viewed from the two adjoining streets. It has existed since about the year 1100, but was greatly reduced in the 19th century to allow for the construction of new streets and buildings, the most notable of which is the wing taking up the eastern end and having [[Elizabeth Tower|the most prominent tower]] of the current palace. Speaker's Green fronts the [[Tideway|Thames]]. An underground car park used by Members of Parliament is beneath. Before latest incarnations of the palace, the yard was an open public space used diversely such as for speeches, tournaments, [[pillory]]ings, and executions. It has twice been the scene of terrorist attacks.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:New Palace Yard arcade, Palace of Westminster.jpg|left|thumb|Arcade along the east side of New Palace Yard]]\n\nNew Palace Yard takes up the north-west corner of the grounds of the Palace of Westminster. It is bordered to the north by Bridge Street, to the east by the Palace's North Front and [[Big Ben]], to the south by [[Westminster Hall]] and to the west by [[Parliament Square]]. It is accessed from Parliament Square via the Carriage Gates. Underneath the yard is a five-level underground car park with 450 spaces for the cars of Members of Parliament, built from 1972 to 1974 for \u00a32.5 million ({{Inflation|GBP|2500000|1972|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).<ref name=\"Old and New\"/><ref name=\"FellMackenzie1988\">{{cite book|last1=Fell|first1=Bryan H.|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Kenneth R.|last3=Natzler|first3=D.

The yard was created after [[William II of England]] constructed Westminster Hall in 1097 and was given the appellation \"New\" to distinguish it from [[Old Palace Yard]] a few hundred metres further south. For several hundred years, it was probably a patch of low-lying open marshy ground or perhaps even an inlet, prone to flooding up to very recent times. A rapid increase in the level of the Thames necessitated the construction of a river wall on the yard's eastern side in the 12th century.<ref name=\"ThomasCowie2006\" /> It was reclaimed by laying down cobbles on successive layers of debris that had accumulated over the years<ref name=\"McKay2010\">{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Chris|title=Big Ben: the Great Clock and the Bells at the Palace of Westminster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ScUDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|date=27 May 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958569-4|pages=32\u2013}}</ref> and was laid out as an open space by the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century.

It was one of three yards in the palace: New Palace Yard was the outer [[Ward (castle)|ward]], a large open space which the general populace could access; the Green Yard was the middle ward, where the royal administration and the great offices of state were located; and Old Palace Yard was the inner ward, where the royal apartments were located.<ref name=\"ThomasCowie2006\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Christopher|last2=Cowie|first2=Robert|last3=Sidell|first3=Jane|title=The Royal Palace, Abbey and Town of Westminster on Thorney Island: Archaeological Excavations (1991-8) for the London Underground Limited Jubilee Line Extension Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIpnAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Museum of London Archaeology Service|isbn=978-1-901992-50-2|page=158}}</ref>\n\nThe interior of the yard was dominated for centuries by a large cupola-topped fountain built by [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1443, which stood until the late 17th century.<ref name=\"Old and New\" /> According to the 16th century historian [[John Stow]], the fountain, which was known as the Great Conduit, was made to run with wine to mark coronations and other great state events.<ref name=\"ArcherGoldring2007\">{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Jayne Elisabeth|last2=Goldring|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Knight|first3=Sarah|title=The Progresses, Pageants, and Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdyz_arO94sC&pg=PR6-IA5|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160879-7|page=6}}</ref> The remains of the fountain were rediscovered in the 1970s during the construction of the underground car park.<ref name=\"Old and New\"/>\n\nSeveral executions and mutilations took place there: in 1580 the Puritan attorney [[John Stubbs]] and his servant William Page both had their hands cut off as punishment for libelling Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], while in 1612 the Scottish nobleman [[Robert Crichton, 8th Lord Crichton of Sanquhar]], was hanged in the yard for murder.<ref name=\"Bard2013\">{{cite book|last=Bard|first=Robert|title=Tyburn: The Story of London's Gallows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWyoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85|year=2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1571-4|page=538}}</ref> Lesser criminals were publicly exposed in a [[pillory]] erected on the site.

It has existed since about the year 1100 but is greatly reduced to allow for the building of new streets and buildings, most notably the wing which has [[Elizabeth Tower|the most prominent tower]] of the current palace and Speaker's Green to take up the eastern end in the 19th century; the latter fronts the [[Tideway|Thames]]. An underground car park used by Members of Parliament is beneath. Before latest incarnations of the palace, the yard was an open public space used diversely such as for speeches, tournaments, [[pillory]]ings, and executions. It has twice been the scene of terrorist attacks.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:New Palace Yard arcade, Palace of Westminster.jpg|left|thumb|Arcade along the east side of New Palace Yard]]\n\nNew Palace Yard takes up the north-west corner of the grounds of the Palace of Westminster. It is bordered to the north by Bridge Street, to the east by the Palace's North Front and [[Big Ben]], to the south by [[Westminster Hall]] and to the west by [[Parliament Square]]. It is accessed from Parliament Square via the Carriage Gates. Underneath the yard is a five-level underground car park with 450 spaces for the cars of Members of Parliament, built from 1972 to 1974 for \u00a32.5 million ({{Inflation|GBP|2500000|1972|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).<ref name=\"Old and New\"/><ref name=\"FellMackenzie1988\">{{cite book|last1=Fell|first1=Bryan H.|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Kenneth R.|last3=Natzler|first3=D.

Around the outside are a number of old [[catalpa]] trees. A fountain in the central lawn was installed in 1977 to commemorate the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] and recalls the lost medieval fountain of Henry VI.<ref name=\"Old and New\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/oldandnewpalaceyards-/|title=Old and New Palace Yards|access-date=12 May 2010|publisher=[[Houses of Parliament]]}}</ref> The fountain stands in an octagonal pool in the centre of which is a large welded steel sculpture by [[Walenty Pytel]]. The sculpture is decorated with depictions of birds and beasts from six continents and is surmounted by a gilded crown.<ref name=\"WeinrebHibbert1993\" />\n\n==History==\nThe name of New Palace Yard refers to the first Palace of Westminster, built by the Anglo-Saxon king [[Edward the Confessor]] around 1050. The yard was created after [[William II of England]] constructed Westminster Hall in 1097 and was given the appellation \"New\" to distinguish it from [[Old Palace Yard]] a few hundred metres further south. For several hundred years, it was probably a patch of low-lying open marshy ground or perhaps even an inlet, prone to flooding up to very recent times. A rapid increase in the level of the Thames necessitated the construction of a river wall on the yard's eastern side in the 12th century.<ref name=\"ThomasCowie2006\" /> It was reclaimed by laying down cobbles on successive layers of debris that had accumulated over the years<ref name=\"McKay2010\">{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Chris|title=Big Ben: the Great Clock and the Bells at the Palace of Westminster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ScUDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|date=27 May 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958569-4|pages=32\u2013}}</ref> and was laid out as an open space by the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. Thereafter, as Westminster grew, the yard came to be surrounded by buildings and walls.<ref name=\"ThomasCowie2006\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Christopher|last2=Cowie|first2=Robert|last3=Sidell|first3=Jane|title=The Royal Palace, Abbey and Town of Westminster on Thorney Island: Archaeological Excavations (1991-8) for the London Underground Limited Jubilee Line Extension Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIpnAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Museum of London Archaeology Service|isbn=978-1-901992-50-2|page=158}}</ref>\n\nThe yard's function in relation to the Palace of Westminster was similar to that of an [[outer bailey]] in a castle. It was one of three yards in the palace: New Palace Yard was the outer [[Ward (castle)|ward]], a large open space which the general populace could access; the Green Yard was the middle ward, where the royal administration and the great offices of state were located; and Old Palace Yard was the inner ward, where the royal apartments were located.<ref name=\"ThomasCowie2006\">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Christopher|last2=Cowie|first2=Robert|last3=Sidell|first3=Jane|title=The Royal Palace, Abbey and Town of Westminster on Thorney Island: Archaeological Excavations (1991-8) for the London Underground Limited Jubilee Line Extension Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIpnAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Museum of London Archaeology Service|isbn=978-1-901992-50-2|page=158}}</ref>\n\nThe interior of the yard was dominated for centuries by a large cupola-topped fountain built by [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1443, which stood until the late 17th century.<ref name=\"Old and New\" /> According to the 16th century historian [[John Stow]], the fountain, which was known as the Great Conduit, was made to run with wine to mark coronations and other great state events.<ref name=\"ArcherGoldring2007\">{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Jayne Elisabeth|last2=Goldring|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Knight|first3=Sarah|title=The Progresses, Pageants, and Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdyz_arO94sC&pg=PR6-IA5|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160879-7|page=6}}</ref> The remains of the fountain were rediscovered in the 1970s during the construction of the underground car park.<ref name=\"Old and New\"/>\n\nSeveral executions and mutilations took place there: in 1580 the Puritan attorney [[John Stubbs]] and his servant William Page both had their hands cut off as punishment for libelling Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], while in 1612 the Scottish nobleman [[Robert Crichton, 8th Lord Crichton of Sanquhar]], was hanged in the yard for murder.<ref name=\"Bard2013\">{{cite book|last=Bard|first=Robert|title=Tyburn: The Story of London's Gallows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWyoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85|year=2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1571-4|page=538}}</ref> Lesser criminals were publicly exposed in a [[pillory]] erected on the site.

A stand was erected for the King on the south side of the yard and challengers exited Westminster Hall on horseback. They proceeded into the yard accompanied by a pageant-car which was drawn by four animals and carried a \"fair young lady\" on \"a goodly chair of cloth of gold\".

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\". The length of time required is due to vaccines requiring multiple rounds of tests before being approved for the public's use.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Trump's baffling coronavirus vaccine event |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/03/trumps-baffling-coronavirus-vaccine-event/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, Trump wrongly blamed the [[Barack Obama administration]] for making \"a decision\" that delayed [[COVID-19 testing]] by the Trump administration.

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area. The Trump administration continued to require laboratories to apply to the FDA for approval, but allowed the laboratories to test while the FDA processed the applications.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenberg |first1=Jon |title=False: Donald Trump stated on March 4, 2020 in a meeting at the White House: \"The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing\" on the coronavirus. |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/06/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-blames-obama-limits-coronavirus-test/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[Politifact]] |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, Trump over-promised on the availability of COVID-19 testing in the United States, claiming that: \"Anybody that wants a test can get a test.\" Firstly, there were criteria needed to qualify for a test; recommendations were needed from doctors or health officials to approve testing.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\". The length of time required is due to vaccines requiring multiple rounds of tests before being approved for the public's use.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Trump's baffling coronavirus vaccine event |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/03/trumps-baffling-coronavirus-vaccine-event/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, Trump wrongly blamed the [[Barack Obama administration]] for making \"a decision\" that delayed [[COVID-19 testing]] by the Trump administration.

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area. The Trump administration continued to require laboratories to apply to the FDA for approval, but allowed the laboratories to test while the FDA processed the applications.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenberg |first1=Jon |title=False: Donald Trump stated on March 4, 2020 in a meeting at the White House: \"The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing\" on the coronavirus. |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/06/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-blames-obama-limits-coronavirus-test/ |accessdate=March 24, 2020 |work=[[Politifact]] |date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, Trump over-promised on the availability of COVID-19 testing in the United States, claiming that: \"Anybody that wants a test can get a test.\" Firstly, there were criteria needed to qualify for a test; recommendations were needed from doctors or health officials to approve testing.

A well-known Christian opponent of the [[Nazi Party]], he was arrested more than once and spent six years at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. Kogon was known in Germany as a journalist, sociologist, political scientist, author, and politician. He was considered one of the \"intellectual fathers\" of both [[West Germany]] and [[European integration]].\n\n== Early years ==\nKogon was born in [[Munich]], the son of an unmarried Russian-Jewish mother from [[Mykolaiv]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]] now [[Ukraine]]. Kogon was given into a foster family shortly after his birth.<ref>http://www.xecutives.net/component/content/article?id=620</ref> He spent the larger portion of his youth in Catholic [[monastery|monasteries]]. After studying [[economics]] and [[sociology]] at the universities in Munich, [[Florence]], and [[Vienna]], Kogon received his doctorate in 1927 in Vienna with a dissertation on the ''Faschismus und Korporativstaat'' (\"Corporate State and Fascism\"). That same year, Kogon got a job as editor of the Catholic magazine ''Sch\u00f6nere Zukunft'' (\"Brighter Future\") and stayed there till 1937. Through his work, he made the acquaintance of sociologist [[Othmar Spann]], who recommended him for the ''Zentralkommission der christlichen Gewerkschaften'' (\"Central Committee of Christian Unions\"). Kogon was an advisor there several years later. In 1934, after the [[July Putsch]], Kogon took over the asset management of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg-Koh\u00e1ry]] for Prince [[Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1901-1985)|Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg]].\n\n== Nazi resistance ==\nAn avowed opponent of Nazism, Kogon was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in 1936 and again in March 1937, charged with, among other things, \"work[ing] for anti-national socialist forces outside the territory of the Reich\". In March 1938, he was arrested a third time and, in September 1939, was deported to Buchenwald, where he spent the next six years as \"prisoner number 9093\". {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAt Buchenwald, Kogon spent part of his time working as a clerk for [[Sanit\u00e4tswesen#Camp doctors|camp doctor]] [[Erwin Ding-Schuler]], who headed up the typhus experimentation ward there. According to Kogon's own statements, he was able to develop a relationship bordering on trust with Ding-Schuler, after becoming his clerk in 1943. In time, they had conversations about family concerns, the political situation and events at the front. According to Kogon, through his influence on Ding-Schuler, he was able to save the lives of many prisoners,<ref>Eugen Kogon, ''Der SS-Staat.

Retrieved March 16, 2011</ref> In early April 1945, Kogon and the head prisoner nurse in the typhus experimentation ward, [[Arthur Dietzsch]], found out from Ding-Schuler that their names were on a list of 46 prisoners whom the SS wanted to execute shortly before the expected liberation of the camp.

[while] the remaining forty-five men [hid underground] ...\"</ref>\n\nRight after being liberated in 1945, Kogon again began working as a journalist. He worked as a volunteer historian for the [[United States Army]] at [[Camp King]] and began writing his book ''Der SS-Staat: Das System der deutschen [[Konzentrationslager]]'' (\"The SS-State: The System of the German Concentration Camps\"), first published in 1946, which still stands as the basic reference on Nazi crimes. The book was translated into several languages. The [[German language]] version alone sold 500,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nDespite this intensive involvement with the past, Kogon primarily chose to look ahead, toward building a new society\u2014one that would blend with Kogon's convictions of Christianity and socialism. Kogon had already spoken about his ideas in Buchenwald with fellow prisoner [[Kurt Schumacher]]. However, the rapid growth of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] hindered the proposed alliance of right-wing [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] into a \"Labour Party\" after the [[Labour Party (UK)|British model]].\n\n== Journalism ==\n[[File:Eugen Kogon 1947.jpg|thumb|200px|Giving his eyewitness testimony on 16 April 1947 at the [[Dachau Trials#Camp trials|Buchenwald Trials]]]]\nIn September 1945, Kogon and other journalists, among them [[Walter Dirks]], later his friend and companion, published the ''Frankfurter Leits\u00e4tze'' (\"Frankfurt Guiding Principles\"). In this ''Program of the Volkspartei'' (\"popular party\"), they called for an \"economic socialism on a democratic basis\", laying out an important basis for the Christian-socialist founding program of the Hessian [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), also for the [[Constitution of Hesse]], which was finalized at the end of 1946 and provided for the nationalization of key industries.\n\nIn 1946, Kogon and Dirks founded the ''Frankfurter Hefte'' (\"Frankfurt Notebooks\"), a cultural and political magazine with a left-wing Catholic point of view. They quickly reached a circulation of 75,000, which was very high for that time and, until 1984, remained one of the most influential socio-political and cultural magazines in the postwar era. In the {{ill|Gesellschaft Imshausen|de}}, Kogon was involved in the search for a \"third way\" in the renewal of Germany. He quickly turned away from [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s CDU, which was not interested in communal ownership and nationalization of key industries. Kogon instead wrote many essays taking a critical look at the Adenauer government. Among other issues, he turned against the [[Wiederbewaffnung]], [[atomic weapon]]s and the \"madness of excessive armament\".\n\n== European politician ==\nAs a lesson from Nazism, Kogon early called for departure from a traditional nation-state and fought for the establishment of a [[Europe]]an [[Republic]]. Among others, he was involved in the [[Union of European Federalists]] (UEF) and the German section of the UEF, where he served as the first President from 1949 to 1954. From 1951 to 1953, Kogon was also president of the German council of the [[European Movement]].<ref>J\u00fcrgen Mittag, ''Vom Honoratiorenkreis zum Europanetzwerk: Sechs Jahrzehnte Europ\u00e4ische Bewegung Deutschland''; in \"60 Jahre Europ\u00e4ische Bewegung Deutschland\" Berlin, (2009) p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Grosser]] counted him as one of the three \"creators of Europe\".\n\n== Later years ==\nIn 1951, the [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt|Technische Hochschule Darmstadt]] established the first chair of scientific policy in Germany. The first chair holder was Eugen Kogon. He co-founded the [[political science]] as a field of study in Germany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/universitaet/mitten_in_der_gesellschaft/geschichte_persoenlichkeiten/persoenlichkeiten_1/eugen_kogon/index.en.jsp|title=Eugen Kogon|last=Darmstadt|first=Technische Universit\u00e4t|website=Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> He was teaching there till his retirement in 1968, whereupon he was made professor [[emeritus]].<ref name=\":0\" /> University president [[Johann-Dietrich W\u00f6rner]] later attested to Kogon's importance, saying, \"He shaped the moral conscience of the university to the present day.\". From January 1964 to January 1965, Kogon headed the political magazine \"Panorama\", broadcast by the German station [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. He began serving as the program's moderator in March 1964.\n\nLater, Kogon supported the [[Ostpolitik|Eastern policy]] of the [[social-liberal coalition|Social-Liberal coalition]] and actively promoted reconciliation with [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The state of [[Hesse]] honored Kogon in 1982 with the newly created Hessian Culture Prize. His final years were spent in quiet retirement [[K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus]], where there is now a street named for him.<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Eugen-Kogon-Weg,+K%C3%B6nigstein+im+Taunus,+Deutschland&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=61.669968,81.035156&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Eugen-Kogon-Weg,+61462+K%C3%B6nigstein+im+Taunus,+Hochtaunuskreis,+Hessen,+Germany&t=h&z=16 Map link to Eugen-Kogon-Weg, 61462 K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus, Germany] Google Maps.

He worked as a volunteer historian for the [[United States Army]] at [[Camp King]] and began writing his book ''Der SS-Staat: Das System der deutschen [[Konzentrationslager]]'' (\"The SS-State: The System of the German Concentration Camps\"), first published in 1946, which still stands as the basic reference on Nazi crimes. The book was translated into several languages. The [[German language]] version alone sold 500,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nDespite this intensive involvement with the past, Kogon primarily chose to look ahead, toward building a new society\u2014one that would blend with Kogon's convictions of Christianity and socialism. Kogon had already spoken about his ideas in Buchenwald with fellow prisoner [[Kurt Schumacher]]. However, the rapid growth of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] hindered the proposed alliance of right-wing [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] into a \"Labour Party\" after the [[Labour Party (UK)|British model]].\n\n== Journalism ==\n[[File:Eugen Kogon 1947.jpg|thumb|200px|Giving his eyewitness testimony on 16 April 1947 at the [[Dachau Trials#Camp trials|Buchenwald Trials]]]]\nIn September 1945, Kogon and other journalists, among them [[Walter Dirks]], later his friend and companion, published the ''Frankfurter Leits\u00e4tze'' (\"Frankfurt Guiding Principles\"). In this ''Program of the Volkspartei'' (\"popular party\"), they called for an \"economic socialism on a democratic basis\", laying out an important basis for the Christian-socialist founding program of the Hessian [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), also for the [[Constitution of Hesse]], which was finalized at the end of 1946 and provided for the nationalization of key industries.\n\nIn 1946, Kogon and Dirks founded the ''Frankfurter Hefte'' (\"Frankfurt Notebooks\"), a cultural and political magazine with a left-wing Catholic point of view. They quickly reached a circulation of 75,000, which was very high for that time and, until 1984, remained one of the most influential socio-political and cultural magazines in the postwar era. In the {{ill|Gesellschaft Imshausen|de}}, Kogon was involved in the search for a \"third way\" in the renewal of Germany. He quickly turned away from [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s CDU, which was not interested in communal ownership and nationalization of key industries. Kogon instead wrote many essays taking a critical look at the Adenauer government. Among other issues, he turned against the [[Wiederbewaffnung]], [[atomic weapon]]s and the \"madness of excessive armament\".\n\n== European politician ==\nAs a lesson from Nazism, Kogon early called for departure from a traditional nation-state and fought for the establishment of a [[Europe]]an [[Republic]]. Among others, he was involved in the [[Union of European Federalists]] (UEF) and the German section of the UEF, where he served as the first President from 1949 to 1954. From 1951 to 1953, Kogon was also president of the German council of the [[European Movement]].<ref>J\u00fcrgen Mittag, ''Vom Honoratiorenkreis zum Europanetzwerk: Sechs Jahrzehnte Europ\u00e4ische Bewegung Deutschland''; in \"60 Jahre Europ\u00e4ische Bewegung Deutschland\" Berlin, (2009) p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Grosser]] counted him as one of the three \"creators of Europe\".\n\n== Later years ==\nIn 1951, the [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt|Technische Hochschule Darmstadt]] established the first chair of scientific policy in Germany. The first chair holder was Eugen Kogon. He co-founded the [[political science]] as a field of study in Germany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/universitaet/mitten_in_der_gesellschaft/geschichte_persoenlichkeiten/persoenlichkeiten_1/eugen_kogon/index.en.jsp|title=Eugen Kogon|last=Darmstadt|first=Technische Universit\u00e4t|website=Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> He was teaching there till his retirement in 1968, whereupon he was made professor [[emeritus]].<ref name=\":0\" /> University president [[Johann-Dietrich W\u00f6rner]] later attested to Kogon's importance, saying, \"He shaped the moral conscience of the university to the present day.\". From January 1964 to January 1965, Kogon headed the political magazine \"Panorama\", broadcast by the German station [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. He began serving as the program's moderator in March 1964.\n\nLater, Kogon supported the [[Ostpolitik|Eastern policy]] of the [[social-liberal coalition|Social-Liberal coalition]] and actively promoted reconciliation with [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The state of [[Hesse]] honored Kogon in 1982 with the newly created Hessian Culture Prize. His final years were spent in quiet retirement [[K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus]], where there is now a street named for him.<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Eugen-Kogon-Weg,+K%C3%B6nigstein+im+Taunus,+Deutschland&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=61.669968,81.035156&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Eugen-Kogon-Weg,+61462+K%C3%B6nigstein+im+Taunus,+Hochtaunuskreis,+Hessen,+Germany&t=h&z=16 Map link to Eugen-Kogon-Weg, 61462 K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus, Germany] Google Maps.
