Liam knows little himself since it was his father and a man named Serac who built it, but as he is about to reveal Serac's name Dolores is knocked out by Martin, Liam's head of security who discovered Dolores' deception. Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.

As they are a sponsor for the [[Sierra Club]], they mainly focus on outreach to existing and potential donors, that combined, will offer support to programs under the [[Sierra Club]], as well as, other [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit organizations]] that align with their values and goals.<ref name=\"values and goals\" /> On their website, they outline all the programs they fund, as it is very diverse,\u00a0 and their [[Finance|financials]] to ensure full transparency to their donors and audience.\n\n=='''Communications'''==\nThe Sierra Club Foundation has multiple meaningful collaborations to continue fueling its efforts for a cleaner and greener world.
