It took place on October 5, 1813 in [[Upper Canada]], near [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham]]. The British lost control of [[Southwestern Ontario]] as a result of the battle; [[Tecumseh]] and war chief [[Roundhead (Wyandot)|Roundhead]]  were killed, and Tecumseh's Confederacy largely fell apart.\n\nBritish troops under Major General [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]] had occupied Detroit until the [[United States Navy]] gained control of Lake Erie, depriving them of their supplies. Procter was forced to retreat north up the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]] to Moraviantown, followed by the tribal confederacy under [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]] and war chief [[Roundhead (Wyandot)|Roundhead]] who were his allies. American infantry and cavalry under Major General [[William Henry Harrison]] drove off the British and then defeated the Indians, who were demoralized by the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead in action. American control was re-established in the Detroit area, the tribal confederacy collapsed, and Procter was court-martialled for his poor leadership\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:William H. Harrison.jpg|upright|thumb|Maj. Gen. [[William Henry Harrison]] led American soldiers in pursuit of the retreating British.]]\nThe American [[Army of the Northwest (United States)|Army of the Northwest]] under [[William Henry Harrison]] was attempting to recover Detroit and capture [[Fort Malden]] at [[Amherstburg, Ontario]] during the last months of 1812 and for much of 1813 from the Right Division of the British Army in Upper Canada, which was commanded by Major General [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]]. The British position depended on maintaining command of [[Lake Erie]], as the sparsely populated region produced insufficient crops and cattle to feed Procter's troops, the sailors of the British ships on the lake, and the large number of Indians and their families gathered at Amherstburg under Tecumseh. Supplies could effectively be brought to them only by ships.<ref>Forester, p.142</ref> Also, if naval command of Lake Erie passed to the Americans, they would be able to land an army on the north shore, cutting off Procter from reinforcement from the east.\n\nBritish armed vessels had maintained control of the lake from the start of the war to the end of July 1813. The [[United States Navy]] was constructing its own squadron at [[Presque Isle Bay]] commanded by Master Commandant [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]. During July, the British under Commander [[Robert Heriot Barclay]] kept the Americans pinned down in Presque Isle, but they had to lift the blockade for two days in order to receive supplies. Perry was able to move his ships across the sandbar at the entrance to the harbor and into the lake, and Barclay failed to attack them. Perry's superior squadron instituted a counter-blockade of Amherstburg as soon as his vessels were armed and manned, and supplies of food rapidly ran short. Finally, with supplies almost exhausted, Barclay put out to seek battle with Perry on September 10, but Perry gained a complete victory in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]]. Perry hastily wrote a note to General Harrison stating: \"We have met the enemy and they are ours\". Harrison knew that Procter would be forced to retreat, so he ordered an advance. One thousand mounted troops began advancing along the lake shore to Detroit, and 2,500 foot soldiers were carried there and to Amherstburg by Perry's ships once they had repaired any damage received during the battle.\n\n===Procter's retreat===\nProcter had made preparations to fall back to the British position at [[Burlington Heights (Ontario)|Burlington Heights]] at the western end of [[Lake Ontario]] even before he received news of Barclay's defeat, and Tecumseh knew that this would remove all protection from the confederation tribes whose lands lay to the west of Detroit. He attempted to dissuade Procter:\n\n<blockquote>Our fleet has gone out, we know they have fought; we have heard the great guns but know nothing of what has happened to our Father with one Arm [''Barclay had lost an arm in 1809'']. Our ships have gone one way, and we are much astonished to see our Father [''Procter''] tying up everything and preparing to run the other, without letting his red children know what his intentions are.... We must compare our Father's conduct to a fat animal that carries its tail upon its back; but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.<ref>Hitsman, p.339</ref></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, Procter could not defend Fort Amherstburg, as there was no food and the guns had been removed from the fort to be mounted on Barclay's ships. He began to retreat up the Thames River on September 27. Tecumseh had no option but to go with him. Procter apparently agreed to a compromise to retreat only as far as Moraviantown, a settlement of [[Lenape]] Indians who had migrated from the United States. This was the highest navigable point of the river, so it was safe from outflanking moves by water. Also, some supplies could be brought there overland from Burlington Heights, although the roads were very poor. However, Procter made no attempt to fortify this position.\n\nThe British retreat was badly managed, and the soldiers had been reduced to half rations. Procter allegedly left the main body of his army under command of Colonel [[Augustus Warburton]] of the [[41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot|41st Regiment]], without orders, while he led the retreat accompanied by his wife and family, the other women and dependents, and his personal baggage.<ref>Katherine B. Coutts, ''Thamesville and the Battle of the Thames'', in Zaslow, p.116</ref> The British soldiers were becoming increasingly demoralized, and Tecumseh's warriors grew ever more impatient with Procter for his unwillingness to stop and fight.\n\nThe Americans left a brigade under [[Duncan McArthur]] to garrison Detroit and another under [[Lewis Cass]] to garrison [[Sandwich, Ontario]]. Harrison led the main body from Sandwich in pursuit of Procter on October 2. As they advanced, Harrison's men captured several abandoned boats and a steady stream of British stragglers. They caught up with the retreating British and Indians late on October 4. Tecumseh skirmished with the Americans near [[Chatham, Ontario]] to slow their advance, but the Indians were quickly overwhelmed. The boats carrying Warburton's reserve ammunition and the last of the food ran aground and were left behind to be captured by an American raiding party.\n\n==Forces==\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Thames-array.jpg|thumb|Diagram by [[Bennett H. Young]] of the forces arrayed in the battle]]\n{{Further|Battle of the Thames order of battle}}\nWilliam Henry Harrison's force numbered at least 3,500 infantry and cavalry. He had a small detachment of regulars from the 27th U.S. Infantry and five brigades of Kentucky militia led by [[Isaac Shelby]], the 63 year-old governor of Kentucky and a hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He also had 1,000 volunteer cavalry under Colonel [[Richard Mentor Johnson]]. Most of Johnson's men were from Kentucky, but some were from the [[River Raisin]] area of Michigan, all of them spurred on by the slogan \"[[Battle of Frenchtown|Remember the River Raisin]].\"\n\nProcter had about 800 soldiers, mainly from the 41st Regiment. The veterans of the regiment's 1st Battalion had been serving in Upper Canada since the start of the war and had suffered heavy casualties in several engagements in 1813, including the Battle of Lake Erie, where more than 150 of its men had served aboard Barclay's ships. They had been reinforced by the young soldiers of the 2nd Battalion. Most of the regiment's officers were dissatisfied with Procter's leadership, but Colonel Warburton, the next in seniority, refused to countenance any move to remove him from command.

He planned to trap Harrison on the banks of the Thames, driving the Americans off the road with cannon fire, but he had made no attempt to fortify the position by creating [[abatis]] or throwing up earthworks, and the ground presented no obstacle to the American horsemen, while scattered trees masked the British fire. Tecumseh's men formed a line in a black ash swamp on the British right to flank the Americans. Tecumseh rode along the British line, shaking hands with each officer before rejoining his warriors.<ref>Katherine B. Coutts, ''Thamesville and the Battle of the Thames'', in Zaslow, p.117</ref>\nGeneral Harrison surveyed the battlefield and ordered [[James Johnson (Kentucky)|James Johnson]] (brother of Richard Mentor Johnson) to make a frontal attack on the British regulars with his mounted riflemen. Despite the Indians' flanking fire, Johnson's Kentuckians broke through, the British cannon not having fired. The exhausted, dispirited, and half-starved British regulars fired a single ragged fusillade before retreating. Procter and about 250 of his men fled from the battlefield, while the rest of his soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered.\n[[File:Outdoor life and Indian stories - making open air life attractive to young Americans by telling them all about woodcraft, signs and signaling, the stars, fishing, camping - also stories of noted (14566564408).jpg|thumb|Depiction of Col [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] shooting Tecumseh during the battle]]\nTecumseh and his followers remained and carried on fighting. Johnson charged into the Indian position at the head of about 20 horsemen to draw attention away from the main American force, but Tecumseh and his men answered with a volley of musket fire that stopped the cavalry charge. Fifteen of Johnson's men were killed or wounded (Johnson himself was hit five times), and his main force became bogged down in the swamp mud. Tecumseh and Roundhead are believed to have been killed during this fighting. The main force finally made its way through the swamp, and James Johnson's troops were freed from their attack on the British. The American reinforcements were converging as news spread of the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead, and Indian resistance dissolved. Richard Mentor Johnson claimed to have shot Tecumseh,<ref>Elting (1995), p.113</ref> though the evidence is unclear; [[William Whitley]] was a Revolutionary War veteran who is also credited with killing him.

Lieutenant Richard Bullock of the 41st Regiment, however, said that there were 12 killed and 36 wounded prisoners. More than a year after the battle, British Colonel Augustus Warburton and Lieutenant Colonel William Evans both reported that 18 were killed and 25 wounded.<ref name=Sugden127/> Harrison reported 601 British troops captured, a figure that included the prisoners taken during the retreat leading up to the battle and stragglers captured after it.<ref name=Antal347/>\n\nThe Indians recorded their own casualties as 16 killed, including Tecumseh and Roundhead,<ref name=Sugden133/> although Harrison claimed that 33 dead Indians were found in the woods after the battle.<ref name=Gilpin226/> General Procter wrote in a letter dated October 23, 1813, \"The Indian cause and ours experienced a serious loss in the death of Round Head.\"\n\nThere are conflicting versions of the American loss in the battle. Harrison stated that 7 were killed outright, 5 died of wounds, and 17 more were wounded. Major Isaac Shelby said that 7 or 8 were killed outright, 4 died of their wounds, and about 20 more were wounded.

American victory at the Thames failed to translate into recapture of Illinois, Wisconsin, and other Midwestern territories, which the British and Indians held until the war's end; efforts also failed to regain control of the Old Northwest and of fur trade routes after the British victory at the subsequent [[Engagements on Lake Huron]].\n\nThe death of Tecumseh was a crushing blow to the Indian alliance which he created, and it dissolved following the battle. Harrison signed an armistice at Detroit with the chiefs or representatives of several tribes,<ref name=Hitsman176>Hitsman, p.176</ref> although others fought on until the end of the war and beyond. He then transferred most of his regulars east to the Niagara River and went himself to Washington where he was acclaimed a hero. However, a comparatively petty dispute with President [[James Madison]] and John Armstrong resulted in him resigning his commission as Major General.<ref>Elting, p.114</ref> Harrison's popularity grew, and he was eventually elected President. Richard Mentor Johnson eventually became Vice President to President [[Martin Van Buren]], based partly on the belief that he had personally killed Tecumseh.\n\nProcter later rallied 246 men of the 41st Regiment at the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]],<ref name=Hitsman176/> reinforced by some young soldiers of the 2nd battalion who had not been present at the battle. The two battalions were reorganized and merged, as the regiment was severely understrength at this point, and the survivors of the 1st Battalion were placed in the grenadier and light infantry companies.<ref>[http://www.warof1812.ca/41stregt.htm The 41st Regiment and the War of 1812, by Jim Yaworsky]</ref> The soldiers of the 41st who were taken prisoner at Moraviantown and the Battle of Lake Erie were exchanged or released towards the end of 1814. They had been held in encampments near [[Sandusky, Ohio]] and had suffered severely from sickness during their captivity.\n\nIn May 1814, Procter was charged with negligence and improper conduct, though a court martial could not be held until December, when campaigning had ceased for the winter and a senior board of officers could be assembled. They judged that Procter had managed the retreat badly, failing to secure his stores, and also disposed the troops ineffectively at Moraviantown. He was sentenced to be suspended from rank and pay for six months.<ref>Hitsman, p.344 en</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Thames order of battle==\nThe following units and commanders of the American, British and Native American armed forces Battle of the Thames during the [[War of 1812]]\n\n;Abbreviations used\n{{col div}}\n* '''MG''' = [[Major general (United States)|Major General]]\n* '''BG''' = [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]]\n* '''Col''' = [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]\n* '''Ltc''' = [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]\n* '''Maj''' = [[Major (United States)|Major]]\n* '''Cpt''' = [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]\n* '''Lt''' = [[First lieutenant#United States|1st Lieutenant]]\n* '''w''' = wounded\n* '''k''' = killed\n* '''m''' = missing\n{{col div end}}\n===American Forces===\n'''[[Army of the Northwest (United States)|Army of the Northwest]]''': MG [[William Henry Harrison]]\n\nGeneral Staff\n*Inspector-General: Col George Walker\n*Military Secretary: Maj William T.

It took place on October 5, 1813 in [[Upper Canada]], near [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham]]. The British lost control of [[Southwestern Ontario]] as a result of the battle; [[Tecumseh]] and war chief [[Roundhead (Wyandot)|Roundhead]]  were killed, and Tecumseh's Confederacy largely fell apart.\n\nBritish troops under Major General [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]] had occupied Detroit until the [[United States Navy]] gained control of Lake Erie, depriving them of their supplies. Procter was forced to retreat north up the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]] to Moraviantown, followed by the tribal confederacy under [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]] and war chief [[Roundhead (Wyandot)|Roundhead]] who were his allies. American infantry and cavalry under Major General [[William Henry Harrison]] drove off the British and then defeated the Indians, who were demoralized by the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead in action. American control was re-established in the Detroit area, the tribal confederacy collapsed, and Procter was court-martialled for his poor leadership\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:William H. Harrison.jpg|upright|thumb|Maj. Gen. [[William Henry Harrison]] led American soldiers in pursuit of the retreating British.]]\nThe American [[Army of the Northwest (United States)|Army of the Northwest]] under [[William Henry Harrison]] was attempting to recover Detroit and capture [[Fort Malden]] at [[Amherstburg, Ontario]] during the last months of 1812 and for much of 1813 from the Right Division of the British Army in Upper Canada, which was commanded by Major General [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]]. The British position depended on maintaining command of [[Lake Erie]], as the sparsely populated region produced insufficient crops and cattle to feed Procter's troops, the sailors of the British ships on the lake, and the large number of Indians and their families gathered at Amherstburg under Tecumseh. Supplies could effectively be brought to them only by ships.<ref>Forester, p.142</ref> Also, if naval command of Lake Erie passed to the Americans, they would be able to land an army on the north shore, cutting off Procter from reinforcement from the east.\n\nBritish armed vessels had maintained control of the lake from the start of the war to the end of July 1813. The [[United States Navy]] was constructing its own squadron at [[Presque Isle Bay]] commanded by Master Commandant [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]. During July, the British under Commander [[Robert Heriot Barclay]] kept the Americans pinned down in Presque Isle, but they had to lift the blockade for two days in order to receive supplies. Perry was able to move his ships across the sandbar at the entrance to the harbor and into the lake, and Barclay failed to attack them. Perry's superior squadron instituted a counter-blockade of Amherstburg as soon as his vessels were armed and manned, and supplies of food rapidly ran short. Finally, with supplies almost exhausted, Barclay put out to seek battle with Perry on September 10, but Perry gained a complete victory in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]]. Perry hastily wrote a note to General Harrison stating: \"We have met the enemy and they are ours\". Harrison knew that Procter would be forced to retreat, so he ordered an advance. One thousand mounted troops began advancing along the lake shore to Detroit, and 2,500 foot soldiers were carried there and to Amherstburg by Perry's ships once they had repaired any damage received during the battle.\n\n===Procter's retreat===\nProcter had made preparations to fall back to the British position at [[Burlington Heights (Ontario)|Burlington Heights]] at the western end of [[Lake Ontario]] even before he received news of Barclay's defeat, and Tecumseh knew that this would remove all protection from the confederation tribes whose lands lay to the west of Detroit. He attempted to dissuade Procter:\n\n<blockquote>Our fleet has gone out, we know they have fought; we have heard the great guns but know nothing of what has happened to our Father with one Arm [''Barclay had lost an arm in 1809'']. Our ships have gone one way, and we are much astonished to see our Father [''Procter''] tying up everything and preparing to run the other, without letting his red children know what his intentions are.... We must compare our Father's conduct to a fat animal that carries its tail upon its back; but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.<ref>Hitsman, p.339</ref></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, Procter could not defend Fort Amherstburg, as there was no food and the guns had been removed from the fort to be mounted on Barclay's ships. He began to retreat up the Thames River on September 27. Tecumseh had no option but to go with him. Procter apparently agreed to a compromise to retreat only as far as Moraviantown, a settlement of [[Lenape]] Indians who had migrated from the United States. This was the highest navigable point of the river, so it was safe from outflanking moves by water. Also, some supplies could be brought there overland from Burlington Heights, although the roads were very poor. However, Procter made no attempt to fortify this position.\n\nThe British retreat was badly managed, and the soldiers had been reduced to half rations. Procter allegedly left the main body of his army under command of Colonel [[Augustus Warburton]] of the [[41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot|41st Regiment]], without orders, while he led the retreat accompanied by his wife and family, the other women and dependents, and his personal baggage.<ref>Katherine B. Coutts, ''Thamesville and the Battle of the Thames'', in Zaslow, p.116</ref> The British soldiers were becoming increasingly demoralized, and Tecumseh's warriors grew ever more impatient with Procter for his unwillingness to stop and fight.\n\nThe Americans left a brigade under [[Duncan McArthur]] to garrison Detroit and another under [[Lewis Cass]] to garrison [[Sandwich, Ontario]]. Harrison led the main body from Sandwich in pursuit of Procter on October 2. As they advanced, Harrison's men captured several abandoned boats and a steady stream of British stragglers. They caught up with the retreating British and Indians late on October 4. Tecumseh skirmished with the Americans near [[Chatham, Ontario]] to slow their advance, but the Indians were quickly overwhelmed. The boats carrying Warburton's reserve ammunition and the last of the food ran aground and were left behind to be captured by an American raiding party.\n\n==Forces==\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Thames-array.jpg|thumb|Diagram by [[Bennett H. Young]] of the forces arrayed in the battle]]\n{{Further|Battle of the Thames order of battle}}\nWilliam Henry Harrison's force numbered at least 3,500 infantry and cavalry. He had a small detachment of regulars from the 27th U.S. Infantry and five brigades of Kentucky militia led by [[Isaac Shelby]], the 63 year-old governor of Kentucky and a hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He also had 1,000 volunteer cavalry under Colonel [[Richard Mentor Johnson]]. Most of Johnson's men were from Kentucky, but some were from the [[River Raisin]] area of Michigan, all of them spurred on by the slogan \"[[Battle of Frenchtown|Remember the River Raisin]].\"\n\nProcter had about 800 soldiers, mainly from the 41st Regiment. The veterans of the regiment's 1st Battalion had been serving in Upper Canada since the start of the war and had suffered heavy casualties in several engagements in 1813, including the Battle of Lake Erie, where more than 150 of its men had served aboard Barclay's ships. They had been reinforced by the young soldiers of the 2nd Battalion. Most of the regiment's officers were dissatisfied with Procter's leadership, but Colonel Warburton, the next in seniority, refused to countenance any move to remove him from command. Tecumseh and Roundhead led about 500 Indians.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:BRM3144-Shelton-Kensett-Col-Johnsons-Mounted-Men-1813-3000x1871.jpg|thumb|left|An engraving that depicts American mounted riflemen charging at British artillerists and native warriors.]]\nProcter ordered his troops to abandon their half-cooked breakfast and retreat a further two miles shortly after daybreak on October 5, then formed them into line of battle with a single 6-pounder cannon. He planned to trap Harrison on the banks of the Thames, driving the Americans off the road with cannon fire, but he had made no attempt to fortify the position by creating [[abatis]] or throwing up earthworks, and the ground presented no obstacle to the American horsemen, while scattered trees masked the British fire. Tecumseh's men formed a line in a black ash swamp on the British right to flank the Americans. Tecumseh rode along the British line, shaking hands with each officer before rejoining his warriors.<ref>Katherine B. Coutts, ''Thamesville and the Battle of the Thames'', in Zaslow, p.117</ref>\nGeneral Harrison surveyed the battlefield and ordered [[James Johnson (Kentucky)|James Johnson]] (brother of Richard Mentor Johnson) to make a frontal attack on the British regulars with his mounted riflemen. Despite the Indians' flanking fire, Johnson's Kentuckians broke through, the British cannon not having fired. The exhausted, dispirited, and half-starved British regulars fired a single ragged fusillade before retreating. Procter and about 250 of his men fled from the battlefield, while the rest of his soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered.\n[[File:Outdoor life and Indian stories - making open air life attractive to young Americans by telling them all about woodcraft, signs and signaling, the stars, fishing, camping - also stories of noted (14566564408).jpg|thumb|Depiction of Col [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] shooting Tecumseh during the battle]]\nTecumseh and his followers remained and carried on fighting. Johnson charged into the Indian position at the head of about 20 horsemen to draw attention away from the main American force, but Tecumseh and his men answered with a volley of musket fire that stopped the cavalry charge. Fifteen of Johnson's men were killed or wounded (Johnson himself was hit five times), and his main force became bogged down in the swamp mud. Tecumseh and Roundhead are believed to have been killed during this fighting. The main force finally made its way through the swamp, and James Johnson's troops were freed from their attack on the British. The American reinforcements were converging as news spread of the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead, and Indian resistance dissolved. Richard Mentor Johnson claimed to have shot Tecumseh,<ref>Elting (1995), p.113</ref> though the evidence is unclear; [[William Whitley]] was a Revolutionary War veteran who is also credited with killing him.

Brown states that there were 25 killed or fatally injured and 50 wounded in Johnson's regiment, and 2 killed and 6-7 wounded in the infantry, for a total of 27 killed and 56 or 57 wounded.<ref name=SugdenBrown/> Harrison informed Secretary of War [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] that the only casualties inflicted by the British were three men wounded; all of the rest were caused by the Indians.<ref name=Sugden127/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|thumb|upright|The death of [[Tecumseh]] during the battle was a crushing blow for the native [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|Confederacy]] he created.]]\nThe American victory led to re-established American control over the Northwest frontier, and the Detroit area remained comparatively quiet for the rest of the war, apart from skirmishes such as the [[Battle of Longwoods]] and an American mounted raid near the end of 1814 which resulted in the [[Battle of Malcolm's Mills]]. American victory at the Thames failed to translate into recapture of Illinois, Wisconsin, and other Midwestern territories, which the British and Indians held until the war's end; efforts also failed to regain control of the Old Northwest and of fur trade routes after the British victory at the subsequent [[Engagements on Lake Huron]].\n\nThe death of Tecumseh was a crushing blow to the Indian alliance which he created, and it dissolved following the battle. Harrison signed an armistice at Detroit with the chiefs or representatives of several tribes,<ref name=Hitsman176>Hitsman, p.176</ref> although others fought on until the end of the war and beyond. He then transferred most of his regulars east to the Niagara River and went himself to Washington where he was acclaimed a hero. However, a comparatively petty dispute with President [[James Madison]] and John Armstrong resulted in him resigning his commission as Major General.<ref>Elting, p.114</ref> Harrison's popularity grew, and he was eventually elected President. Richard Mentor Johnson eventually became Vice President to President [[Martin Van Buren]], based partly on the belief that he had personally killed Tecumseh.\n\nProcter later rallied 246 men of the 41st Regiment at the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]],<ref name=Hitsman176/> reinforced by some young soldiers of the 2nd battalion who had not been present at the battle. The two battalions were reorganized and merged, as the regiment was severely understrength at this point, and the survivors of the 1st Battalion were placed in the grenadier and light infantry companies.<ref>[http://www.warof1812.ca/41stregt.htm The 41st Regiment and the War of 1812, by Jim Yaworsky]</ref> The soldiers of the 41st who were taken prisoner at Moraviantown and the Battle of Lake Erie were exchanged or released towards the end of 1814. They had been held in encampments near [[Sandusky, Ohio]] and had suffered severely from sickness during their captivity.\n\nIn May 1814, Procter was charged with negligence and improper conduct, though a court martial could not be held until December, when campaigning had ceased for the winter and a senior board of officers could be assembled. They judged that Procter had managed the retreat badly, failing to secure his stores, and also disposed the troops ineffectively at Moraviantown. He was sentenced to be suspended from rank and pay for six months.<ref>Hitsman, p.344 en</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Thames order of battle==\nThe following units and commanders of the American, British and Native American armed forces Battle of the Thames during the [[War of 1812]]\n\n;Abbreviations used\n{{col div}}\n* '''MG''' = [[Major general (United States)|Major General]]\n* '''BG''' = [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]]\n* '''Col''' = [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]\n* '''Ltc''' = [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]\n* '''Maj''' = [[Major (United States)|Major]]\n* '''Cpt''' = [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]\n* '''Lt''' = [[First lieutenant#United States|1st Lieutenant]]\n* '''w''' = wounded\n* '''k''' = killed\n* '''m''' = missing\n{{col div end}}\n===American Forces===\n'''[[Army of the Northwest (United States)|Army of the Northwest]]''': MG [[William Henry Harrison]]\n\nGeneral Staff\n*Inspector-General: Col George Walker\n*Military Secretary: Maj William T.
