Several technical approaches have been proposed, but there has been no legal framework to date that has required satellite operators to clean up the [[negative externality]] of their derelict satellites. New approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the cost of object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down [[launch license]] regime to Earth orbits that would require satellite operators to remove one spacecraft for each one deployed.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p13 >{{cite web |last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2014-06-14 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |pages=13\u201314 |quote=''for disposing of these obsolete or derelict spacecraft all [approaches] involve the expenditure of substantially more delta-V than what has been traditional.

One team is shown a fill-in-the-blank and its top seven answers, with the first letter of each word in each correct answer being shown as a clue. For example, if the question is \"When I think of [[Italy]], I think of [blank],\" an answer might be \"L______ T____\" for [[Leaning Tower of Pisa | Leaning Tower]].\n\nIn the first round, each team is given one question. The team has a total of 30 seconds to guess all seven answers correctly. The first player offers an answer, and keeps giving answers until giving an answer that is not on the board, at which point control passes to the next player in line. This process continues (going back to the beginning of the line as often as necessary) until either all seven answers are given or time runs out. The team is awarded 100 points for every correct answer, and a 1,000-point bonus (1,700 total) if they can get all seven answers within the 30 seconds. Along the way, players must answer in turn; giving an answer out of turn\u2014including before the previous player's answer is ruled incorrect\u2014results in a five-second penalty (and the answer being disregarded). If the team cannot guess all seven, then the opposing team is given a chance to steal the remaining answers at 100 points each. Steal attempts are untimed, but end when either the board is completed or the stealing team gives an incorrect answer. Synonyms and word forms are acceptable if they correctly fill in the same blank(s) (for example, \"chefs\" and \"cooking\" would both be acceptable for \"cooks,\" but \"physician\" would not be acceptable for \"doctor\").\n\nFor the second round the order of play is reversed but the round is otherwise played the same way, with 200 points given for each correct answer and a 2,000-point bonus for all seven. In the third round, which is played for 300 points per answer and 3,000 bonus points for all seven, the team that is leading after the second round plays first - in case of a tie at this point, the round starts with team that started the game. The team with the most points after all three rounds wins $1,000 and the chance to play for $15,000 in the bonus round.\n\nIn any case, the third round immediately ends the moment the trailing team is [[mathematical elimination|mathematically eliminated]] from at least tying the leading team, which can happen when:\n\n* The leading team gives seven correct answers during its turn, thus scoring 5,100 points;\n* The leading team gives enough correct answers during its turn that the trailing team, even if it steals all remaining answers, cannot reduce the lead to less than 5,200 points;\n* The trailing team is still trailing by at least 5,200 points after an unsuccessful steal attempt;\n* The trailing team is still trailing after completing its turn;\n* The trailing team scores enough points during its turn to take a sufficiently large lead that the team originally leading cannot at least tie the game by stealing;\n* The originally leading team unsuccessfully attempts to steal while trailing;\n* The originally leading team re-takes the lead through stealing;\n\nIn the event of a tie after the third round, a tiebreaker is played between the team captains. The first letter of the top answer is shown, and then the question is shown. The first captain to buzz in is given the chance to answer. If the answer given is correct, that captain wins the game for his or her team. If the answer given is incorrect, then the other team wins automatically.\n\n=== Bonus round ===\nIn the Bonus Round, the winning team has 60 seconds to get the top answers to four more survey questions. The players are lined up in their same order around a central console with a large red Pass Button. Play starts again with the Team Captain, and is similar to the Main Game: a correct guess allows the player to give another answer, a wrong answer passes control to the next player in line.\n\nFor the first survey question, only the top answer is needed, the second needs the top two answers, the third needs the top three answers, and the final question needs the top four answers.\n\nIf a team member feels they are stuck on a question, they can hit the Pass Button (which stops the clock) and skip to the next question. They must return to the passed question once completing the other three in order to win the Bonus. The Pass Button can only be used once during the Bonus Round, and cannot be used once three of the four questions are completed (as there is no other question with which to pass).\n\nPlayers must wait until it is their turn before offering an answer. If a player offers an answer out of turn, the team loses five seconds from their clock.\n\nOnce all the needed answers for each question are correctly guessed, the clock stops and the next question is revealed.

One team is shown a fill-in-the-blank and its top seven answers, with the first letter of each word in each correct answer being shown as a clue. For example, if the question is \"When I think of [[Italy]], I think of [blank],\" an answer might be \"L______ T____\" for [[Leaning Tower of Pisa | Leaning Tower]].\n\nIn the first round, each team is given one question. The team has a total of 30 seconds to guess all seven answers correctly. The first player offers an answer, and keeps giving answers until giving an answer that is not on the board, at which point control passes to the next player in line. This process continues (going back to the beginning of the line as often as necessary) until either all seven answers are given or time runs out. The team is awarded 100 points for every correct answer, and a 1,000-point bonus (1,700 total) if they can get all seven answers within the 30 seconds. Along the way, players must answer in turn; giving an answer out of turn\u2014including before the previous player's answer is ruled incorrect\u2014results in a five-second penalty (and the answer being disregarded). If the team cannot guess all seven, then the opposing team is given a chance to steal the remaining answers at 100 points each. Steal attempts are untimed, but end when either the board is completed or the stealing team gives an incorrect answer. Synonyms and word forms are acceptable if they correctly fill in the same blank(s) (for example, \"chefs\" and \"cooking\" would both be acceptable for \"cooks,\" but \"physician\" would not be acceptable for \"doctor\").\n\nFor the second round the order of play is reversed but the round is otherwise played the same way, with 200 points given for each correct answer and a 2,000-point bonus for all seven. In the third round, which is played for 300 points per answer and 3,000 bonus points for all seven, the team that is leading after the second round plays first - in case of a tie at this point, the round starts with team that started the game. The team with the most points after all three rounds wins $1,000 and the chance to play for $15,000 in the bonus round.\n\nIn any case, the third round immediately ends the moment the trailing team is [[mathematical elimination|mathematically eliminated]] from at least tying the leading team, which can happen when:\n\n* The leading team gives seven correct answers during its turn, thus scoring 5,100 points;\n* The leading team gives enough correct answers during its turn that the trailing team, even if it steals all remaining answers, cannot reduce the lead to less than 5,200 points;\n* The trailing team is still trailing by at least 5,200 points after an unsuccessful steal attempt;\n* The trailing team is still trailing after completing its turn;\n* The trailing team scores enough points during its turn to take a sufficiently large lead that the team originally leading cannot at least tie the game by stealing;\n* The originally leading team unsuccessfully attempts to steal while still trailing;\n* The originally leading team re-takes the lead through stealing;\n\nIn the event of a tie after the third round, a tiebreaker is played between the team captains. The first letter of the top answer is shown, and then the question is shown. The first captain to buzz in is given the chance to answer. If the answer given is correct, that captain wins the game for his or her team. If the answer given is incorrect, then the other team wins automatically.\n\n=== Bonus round ===\nIn the Bonus Round, the winning team has 60 seconds to get the top answers to four more survey questions. The players are lined up in their same order around a central console with a large red Pass Button. Play starts again with the Team Captain, and is similar to the Main Game: a correct guess allows the player to give another answer, a wrong answer passes control to the next player in line.\n\nFor the first survey question, only the top answer is needed, the second needs the top two answers, the third needs the top three answers, and the final question needs the top four answers.\n\nIf a team member feels they are stuck on a question, they can hit the Pass Button (which stops the clock) and skip to the next question. They must return to the passed question once completing the other three in order to win the Bonus. The Pass Button can only be used once during the Bonus Round, and cannot be used once three of the four questions are completed (as there is no other question with which to pass).\n\nPlayers must wait until it is their turn before offering an answer. If a player offers an answer out of turn, the team loses five seconds from their clock.\n\nOnce all the needed answers for each question are correctly guessed, the clock stops and the next question is revealed. The guessing for each subsequent question begins with the player next in line (i.e. if Player 2 gave the last correct answer for a question, the next question's guessing starts with Player 3).\n\nIf the team can give all ten correct answers before time runs out, they win $15,000. If they cannot, they leave with just the $1,000 won in the Main Game.\n\nOn October 29, 2019, \"The Canadians\" (Ayumi Iizuka, Doug Morency, David Ivkovic, and Paul 'PK' Kingston) became the first team to complete a perfect game, amassing 10,400 points in 3 perfect rounds of 1,700, 3,400, and 5,100 points (plus a 200 point steal), and winning the bonus round.\n\n==Reception==\n''America Says'' raised Game Show Network's ratings by 26% over its time slot lead-in, and its women 25-54 ratings by more than 40%.<ref name=GSN /> \n\n''Stars & Celebs'' journalist Bradley Clarke described the series as \"GSN's newest mediocre game show,\" criticizing the low prize money and calling the format \"basically ''[[Family Feud]]'' but without the ''Family Feud'' charm\" as well as stating that the point system \"makes absolutely no sense.\" Clarke did concede that \"the game itself is somewhat fun to play along with.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecelebritycafe.com/2018/06/america-says-is-gsns-newest-mediocre-game-show/|title=''America Says'' is GSN's newest mediocre game show|work=The Celebrity Cafe|last=Clarke|first=Bradley|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHiggins was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] at the [[46th Daytime Emmy Awards]].<ref name=\"NATAS 2019\">{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/daytime-46th-nominations-release-no-credits.pdf|title=The 46th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Nominations |publisher=emmyonline.org and National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2019|year=2019|location=New York |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Family Feud]]''-similar in content\n*[[2018 in television]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/}}\n* {{IMDb title|8305258|America Says}}\n* [https://www.sidereel.com/tv-shows/america-says ''America Says'' on SideReel]\n{{italic title}}\n{{Game Show Network|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2018 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Game Show Network original programming]]\n", "name_user": "Rupertslander", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGameplay", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Says"}
