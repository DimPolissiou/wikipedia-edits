Each year there are between three and four Progress flights to the ISS. A Progress remains docked until shortly before being replaced with a new one or a Soyuz (which will use the same docking port). Then it is filled with waste, disconnected, and de-orbited, at which point it burns up in the atmosphere. Due to the variation in Progress vehicles flown to the ISS, NASA uses its own nomenclature where \"'''ISS 1P'''\" means the first Progress spacecraft to ISS.\n\nProgress was developed because of the need for a constant source of supplies to make long duration space missions possible. It was determined that cosmonauts needed an inflow of consumables (food, water, air, etc.), plus there was a need for maintenance items and scientific payloads that necessitated a dedicated cargo carrier. Such payloads were impractical to launch with passengers in the restricted space of a Soyuz. As of 4 January 2020 there have been 165 [[List of Progress missions|Progress flights]] with three failures. All three failures have occurred since 2011.\n\n== Design ==\n\n[[File:Progress-M spacecraft (with captions).svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the Progress-M spacecraft.]]\nProgress is of much the same size and shape as [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]. It consists of three modules:\n\n* A pressurized forward module. This carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment, clothes, prepackaged and fresh food, and letters from home. The docking drogue is similar to that of the Soyuz but features ducting for the [[Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|UDMH]] fuel and [[dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]] oxidiser.\n* A fuel compartment. The reentry module of the Soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft. This meant that if a leak occurred, the poisonous gas would not enter the station's atmosphere. The fuel is carried in two tanks.\n* A propulsion module. The propulsion module, at the rear of the spacecraft, remained unchanged and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking. It may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked.\n\nReduction in [[mass]] was possible because the Progress was designed to be uncrewed and disposable. This means that there is no need for bulky life support systems and [[heat shield]]s. A small amount of weight is saved due to the lack of automatic rescue crews system and lack of parachutes. The spacecraft also has no ability to split into separate modules. After undocking, the spacecraft performs a retrofire and burns up in the atmosphere.\n\n== Versions ==\n\nThere were many small variations between the different flights, but the major upgrades are reflected in the change of name.\n\n=== Progress (1978\u20131990) ===\n{{main|Progress 7K-TG}}\n[[File:Progress drawing.svg|thumb|Progress logistics resupply spacecraft. It consists of the dry cargo module (left); the tanker compartment (center); and a stretched service module (right).]]\nThere were 42 spacecraft built using the initial '''Progress''' design, the last one being launched in May 1990.\n\nThe bureau in charge of designing the freighter was TsKBEM (now [[RKK Energia]]). They began work on the design in mid-1973, assigning Progress the [[GRAU]] index 11F615A15. The design was complete by February 1974, and the first production model was ready for launch in November 1977. [[Progress 1]] launched on 20 January 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the Soyuz. It still featured the same launch shroud as the Soyuz, though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the [[launch escape system]] had been deactivated.\n\nThis first version of Progress had a mass of 7,020&nbsp;kg and carried 2,300&nbsp;kg of cargo, or 30% of its [[launch mass]]. It had the same diameter as the Soyuz at 2.2 metres, but was 8 metres in length\u2014slightly longer. The autonomous flight time was 3 days, the same time as that of the Soyuz ferry. It could spend one month docked. Progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying (the aft being where the main rocket engines of the station and their tankage, for refueling by the Progress, are located).\n\n* Launch mass: 7,020\u20137,249&nbsp;kg\n* Mass of cargo:\n** ~2,300&nbsp;kg (before Progress-24)\n** ~2,500&nbsp;kg (from Progress-24)\n* Length: 7.94 m\n* Diameter of cargo modules: 2.2 m\n* Maximum diameter: 2.72 m\n* Volume of cargo compartment: 6.6 m<sup>3</sup>\n\n=== Progress-M 11F615A55 (1989-2009) ===\n{{main|Progress-M}}\n[[File:Progress-M drawing.svg|thumb|Progress-M logistics resupply spacecraft.]]\nThe upgraded '''Progress M''' ([[GRAU]]: 11F615A55, manufacturer's designation: 7K-TGM) was first launched in August 1989. The first 43 flights all went to [[Mir]]; following Mir's re-entry, Progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the [[International Space Station]]. As of August 2014, there have been 56 flights to the ISS and more are scheduled.<ref name=\"Nasa Launch Schedule\">{{cite web|title=NASA Launch Schedule &#124; NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html}}</ref>\n\nThe Progress M is essentially the same spacecraft as the Progress, but it features improvements based on the Soyuz T and TM designs. It can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry 100&nbsp;kg more. Also, unlike the old Progress crafts, it can return items to Earth. This is accomplished by using the [[VBK-Raduga|Raduga]] capsule, which can carry up to 150&nbsp;kg of cargo. It is 1.5 m long and 60&nbsp;cm in diameter and has a \"[[dry mass]]\" of 350&nbsp;kg. Progress M can also dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel. It uses the same rendezvous system as the Soyuz, and it features solar panels for the first time.\n\n* Launch mass 7,130&nbsp;kg\n* Cargo mass 2,600&nbsp;kg\n* Dry cargo mass 1,500&nbsp;kg\n* Liquid cargo mass 1,540&nbsp;kg\n* Length 7.23 m\n* Diameter of cargo modules 2.2 m\n* Maximum diameter 2.72 m\n* Dry cargo compartment volume 7.6 m\u00b3\n* Solar array span 10.6 m\n\n=== Progress-\u041c 11F615A60 (2008-2015) ===\n{{main|Progress-M}}\nA new modification of the Progress spacecraft, with new TsVM-101 digital flight computer and MBITS digital telemetry system,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/progress-m-m.htm |title=Progress-M 1M - 25M (11F615A60, 7KTGM) |publisher=Gunter's Space Page |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref> was first launched on 26 November 2008, at 12:38 UTC from the Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.

Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005, they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station, as the [[Space Shuttle]] fleet was grounded after the breakup of ''[[Space shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' at the end of [[STS-107]]. For ISS missions, the Progress M1 variant is used, which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section, and as a result is able to carry more propellant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Progress M-67]], the final flight of a Progress-M spacecraft, was launched 24 July 2009 on a [[Soyuz-U]].\n\n9 July 2018, [[Progress MS-09]] broke a previous record by reaching the ISS in 3 hours and 48 minutes, carrying about 2450&nbsp;kg of cargo and supplies. It delivered food, fuel and supplies, including 705&nbsp;kg of propellant, 50&nbsp;kg of oxygen and air, 420&nbsp;kg of water.\n\nThe [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) operated its own type of robotic supply freighter, the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV). The first of these, named [[Jules Verne ATV|''Jules Verne'']], was launched at 04:03 [[GMT]] on 9 March 2008. ATVs can carry up to 8.85 [[tonne]]s of cargo into space, roughly three times as much as the Progress, and were launched annually by [[Ariane 5]] rockets from 2011-2014 as part of ESA contribution to ISS upkeep. The design is adopted as the [[European Service Module|Service Module]] of the Orion spacecraft.\n\n[[NASA]]'s planned [[Orion spacecraft]] was initially designed to have an uncrewed variant of the Crew module similar to Progress, however this capability has been removed on 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/07/constellation-top-risks-orion-loses-unmanned-capability/ |title=Constellation battle numerous Top Risks \u2013 Orion loses unmanned capability |date=4 July 2009 |author=Chris Bergin |publisher=NASASpaceflight |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref> SpaceX's [[private spaceflight|commercial]] [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] spacecraft and [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems|Northrop Grumman's]] [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft also handle American logistics to the International Space Station.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Progress flights]]\n* [[Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station]]\n* [[Comparison of space station cargo vehicles]]\n* {{annotated link|Cargo spacecraft}}\n** {{annotated link|Automated Transfer Vehicle}}\n** {{annotated link|Cygnus (spacecraft)}}\n** {{annotated link|SpaceX Dragon}}\n** {{annotated link|H-II Transfer Vehicle}}\n* [[Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em|refs=\n<!-- <ref name=ruaviation-20140124>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruaviation.com/news/2014/1/24/2145/ |title=Russia will launch upgraded Progress-MS cargo spacecraft in 2015 |publisher=Russian Aviation |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}</ref> -->\n<ref name=tsenkinews-20150810>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsenki.com/en/news/news_tsenki/?ELEMENT_ID=128142 |title=Upgraded Progress Transport Cargo Spacecraft Getting Ready for Launch |publisher=Yuzhny Space Center |date=10 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Progress (spacecraft)|Progress}}\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/progress.html NASA -

It consists of three modules:\n\n* A pressurized forward module. This carries the supplies for the crew such as scientific equipment, clothes, prepackaged and fresh food, and letters from home. The docking drogue is similar to that of the Soyuz but features ducting for the [[Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|UDMH]] fuel and [[dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]] oxidiser.\n* A fuel compartment. The reentry module of the Soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft. This meant that if a leak occurred, the poisonous gas would not enter the station's atmosphere. The fuel is carried in two tanks.\n* A propulsion module. The propulsion module, at the rear of the spacecraft, remained unchanged and contains the orientation engines used for the automatic docking. It may be used to boost the orbit of the station once docked.\n\nReduction in [[mass]] was possible because the Progress was designed to be uncrewed and disposable. This means that there is no need for bulky life support systems and [[heat shield]]s. A small amount of weight is saved due to the lack of automatic rescue crews system and lack of parachutes. The spacecraft also has no ability to split into separate modules. After undocking, the spacecraft performs a retrofire and burns up in the atmosphere.\n\n== Versions ==\n\nThere were many small variations between the different flights, but the major upgrades are reflected in the change of name.\n\n=== Progress (1978\u20131990) ===\n{{main|Progress 7K-TG}}\n[[File:Progress drawing.svg|thumb|Progress logistics resupply spacecraft. It consists of the dry cargo module (left); the tanker compartment (center); and a stretched service module (right).]]\nThere were 42 spacecraft built using the initial '''Progress''' design, the last one being launched in May 1990.\n\nThe bureau in charge of designing the freighter was TsKBEM (now [[RKK Energia]]). They began work on the design in mid-1973, assigning Progress the [[GRAU]] index 11F615A15. The design was complete by February 1974, and the first production model was ready for launch in November 1977. [[Progress 1]] launched on 20 January 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the Soyuz. It still featured the same launch shroud as the Soyuz, though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the [[launch escape system]] had been deactivated.\n\nThis first version of Progress had a mass of 7,020&nbsp;kg and carried 2,300&nbsp;kg of cargo, or 30% of its [[launch mass]]. It had the same diameter as the Soyuz at 2.2 metres, but was 8 metres in length\u2014slightly longer. The autonomous flight time was 3 days, the same time as that of the Soyuz ferry. It could spend one month docked. Progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying (the aft being where the main rocket engines of the station and their tankage, for refueling by the Progress, are located).\n\n* Launch mass: 7,020\u20137,249&nbsp;kg\n* Mass of cargo:\n** ~2,300&nbsp;kg (before Progress-24)\n** ~2,500&nbsp;kg (from Progress-24)\n* Length: 7.94 m\n* Diameter of cargo modules: 2.2 m\n* Maximum diameter: 2.72 m\n* Volume of cargo compartment: 6.6 m<sup>3</sup>\n\n=== Progress-M 11F615A55 (1989-2009) ===\n{{main|Progress-M}}\n[[File:Progress-M drawing.svg|thumb|Progress-M logistics resupply spacecraft.]]\nThe upgraded '''Progress M''' ([[GRAU]]: 11F615A55, manufacturer's designation: 7K-TGM) was first launched in August 1989. The first 43 flights all went to [[Mir]]; following Mir's re-entry, Progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the [[International Space Station]]. As of August 2014, there have been 56 flights to the ISS and more are scheduled.<ref name=\"Nasa Launch Schedule\">{{cite web|title=NASA Launch Schedule &#124; NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html}}</ref>\n\nThe Progress M is essentially the same spacecraft as the Progress, but it features improvements based on the Soyuz T and TM designs. It can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry 100&nbsp;kg more. Also, unlike the old Progress crafts, it can return items to Earth. This is accomplished by using the [[VBK-Raduga|Raduga]] capsule, which can carry up to 150&nbsp;kg of cargo. It is 1.5 m long and 60&nbsp;cm in diameter and has a \"[[dry mass]]\" of 350&nbsp;kg. Progress M can also dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel. It uses the same rendezvous system as the Soyuz, and it features solar panels for the first time.\n\n* Launch mass 7,130&nbsp;kg\n* Cargo mass 2,600&nbsp;kg\n* Dry cargo mass 1,500&nbsp;kg\n* Liquid cargo mass 1,540&nbsp;kg\n* Length 7.23 m\n* Diameter of cargo modules 2.2 m\n* Maximum diameter 2.72 m\n* Dry cargo compartment volume 7.6 m\u00b3\n* Solar array span 10.6 m\n\n=== Progress-\u041c 11F615A60 (2008-2015) ===\n{{main|Progress-M}}\nA new modification of the Progress spacecraft, with new TsVM-101 digital flight computer and MBITS digital telemetry system,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/progress-m-m.htm |title=Progress-M 1M - 25M (11F615A60, 7KTGM) |publisher=Gunter's Space Page |accessdate=29 March 2013 }}</ref> was first launched on 26 November 2008, at 12:38 UTC from the Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.

Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005, they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station, as the [[Space Shuttle]] fleet was grounded after the breakup of ''[[Space shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' at the end of [[STS-107]]. For ISS missions, the Progress M1 variant is used, which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section, and as a result is able to carry more propellant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Progress M-67]], the final flight of a Progress-M spacecraft, was launched 24 July 2009 on a [[Soyuz-U]].\n\n9 July 2018, [[Progress MS-09]] broke a previous record by reaching the ISS in 3 hours and 48 minutes, carrying about 2450&nbsp;kg of cargo and supplies. It delivered food, fuel and supplies, including 705&nbsp;kg of propellant, 50&nbsp;kg of oxygen and air, 420&nbsp;kg of water.\n\nThe [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) operated its own type of robotic supply freighter, the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV). The first of these, named [[Jules Verne ATV|''Jules Verne'']], was launched at 04:03 [[GMT]] on 9 March 2008. ATVs can carry up to 8.85 [[tonne]]s of cargo into space, roughly three times as much as the Progress, and were launched annually by [[Ariane 5]] rockets from 2011-2014 as part of ESA contribution to ISS upkeep.

{"title_page": "Harmonics (electrical power)", "text_new": "{{Technical|date=October 2019}}\nIn an [[electric power system]], a '''harmonic''' is a voltage or current at a multiple of the fundamental frequency of the system, produced by the action of non-linear loads such as rectifiers, discharge lighting, or saturated magnetic devices.  Harmonic frequencies in the power grid are a frequent cause of [[power quality]] problems. Harmonics in power systems result in increased heating in the equipment and conductors, misfiring in variable speed drives, and torque pulsations in motors.\n\n==Current harmonics==\nIn a normal [[alternating current]] power system, the current varies [[Sine wave|sinusoidally]] at a specific frequency, usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz [[hertz]]. \nWhen a [[linear]] electrical load is connected to the system, it draws a sinusoidal current at the same frequency as the voltage (though usually not in [[phase (waves)|phase]] with the voltage).\n\nCurrent harmonics are caused by non-linear loads. When a non-linear load, such as a [[rectifier]] is connected to the system, it draws a current that is not necessarily sinusoidal. The current waveform distortion can be quite complex, depending on the type of load and its interaction with other components of the system. Regardless of how complex the current waveform becomes, the [[Fourier series]] transform makes it is possible to deconstruct the complex waveform into a series of simple sinusoids, which start at the power system [[fundamental frequency]] and occur at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nFurther examples of non-linear loads include common office equipment such as computers and printers, Fluorescent lighting, battery chargers and also [[variable-speed drive]]s.\n\nIn [[Power engineering|power systems]], harmonics are defined as positive integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Thus, the third harmonic is the third multiple of the fundamental frequency.\n\nHarmonics in power systems of are generated by non-linear loads. Semiconductor devices like transistors, IGBTs, MOSFETS, diodes etc are all non-linear loads. Further examples of non-linear loads include common office equipment such as computers and printers, Fluorescent lighting, battery chargers and also [[variable-speed drive]]s.  Electric motors do not normally contribute significantly to harmonic generation. Both motors and transformers will however create harmonics when they are over-fluxed or saturated. \n\nNon-linear load currents create distortion in the pure sinusoidal voltage waveform supplied by the utility, and this may result in resonance. The even harmonics do not normally exist in power system due to symmetry between the positive- and negative- halves of a cycle.  Further, if the waveforms of the three phases are symmetrical, the harmonic multiples of three are suppressed by delta (\u0394) connection of transformers and motors as described below.\n\nIf we focus for example on only the third harmonic, we can see how all harmonics with a multiple of three behaves in powers systems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Harmonics Made Simple|url = http://ecmweb.com/archive/harmonics-made-simple|website = ecmweb.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}</ref>\n[[File:3rd orderHarmonics.png|thumb|330x330px|3rd Order Harmonic Addition]]\nPower is supplied by a three phase system, where each phase is 120 degrees apart. This is done for two reasons: mainly because three-phase generators and motors are simpler to construct due to constant torque developed across the three phase phases; and secondly, if the three phases are balanced, they sum to zero, and the size of neutral conductors can be reduced or even omitted in some cases. Both these measures results in significant costs savings to utility companies. However, the balanced third harmonic current will not add to zero in the neutral. As seen in the figure, the 3rd harmonic will add constructively across the three phases. This leads to an current in the neutral wire at three times the fundamental frequency, which can cause problems if the system is not designed for it, (i.e. conductors sized only for normal operation.)<ref name=\":0\" /> To reduce the effect of the third order harmonics [[Y-\u0394 transform|delta connections]] are used as attenuators, or third harmonic shorts as the current circulates in the delta the connection instead of flowing in the neutral of a [[Y-\u0394 transformer|wye connection]]. \n[[File:CFL Negative Power.png|thumb|right| A [[compact fluorescent lamp]] is one example of an electrical load with a non-linear characteristic, due to the [[rectifier]] circuit it uses. The current waveform, blue, is highly distorted.]]\n\n==Voltage harmonics==\nVoltage harmonics are mostly caused by current harmonics. The voltage provided by the voltage source will be distorted by current harmonics due to source impedance. If the source impedance of the voltage source is small, current harmonics will cause only small voltage harmonics.  It is typically the case that voltage harmonics are indeed small compared to current harmonics.  For that reason, the voltage waveform can usually be approximated by the [[fundamental frequency]] of voltage.  If this approximation is used, current harmonics produce no effect on the real power transferred to the load.  An intuitive way to see this comes from sketching the voltage wave at fundamental frequency and overlaying a current harmonic with no phase shift (in order to more easily observe the following phenomenon).  What can be observed is that for every period of voltage, there is equal area above the horizontal axis and below the current harmonic wave as there is below the axis and above the current harmonic wave.  This means that the average real power contributed by current harmonics is equal to zero.  However, if higher harmonics of voltage are considered, then current harmonics do make a contribution to the real power transferred to the load.\n\n==Total harmonic distortion==\n[[Total harmonic distortion]], or THD is a common measurement of the level of harmonic distortion present in power systems. THD can be related to either current harmonics or voltage harmonics, and it is defined as the ratio of total harmonics to the value at fundamental frequency times 100%.\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{THD_V} = \\frac{ \\sqrt{V_2^2 + V_3^2 + V_4^2 + \\cdots + V_n^2} }{V_1} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_{k \\mathop = 2}^{n}V_k^2} }{V_1} \\cdot 100\\%\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n{THD_I} = \\frac{ \\sqrt{I_2^2 + I_3^2 + I_4^2 + \\cdots + I_n^2} }{I_1} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_{k \\mathop = 2}^{n}I_k^2} }{I_1} \\cdot 100\\%\n</math>\n\nwhere ''V<sub>k</sub>'' is the RMS voltage of ''k''th harmonic, ''I<sub>k</sub>'' is the RMS current of the ''k''th harmonic,  and ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 is the fundamental frequency.\n\nIt is usually the case that we neglect higher voltage harmonics; however, if we do not neglect them, real power transferred to the load is affected by harmonics. Average real power can be found by adding the product of voltage and current (and power factor, denoted by ''pf'' here) at each higher frequency to the product of voltage and current at the fundamental frequency, or\n\n:<math>\n{P_{avg}} = \\sum_{k \\mathop = 1}^{\\infty} V_k \\cdot I_k \\cdot pf = P_{avg, 1} + P_{avg, 2} + \\cdots\n</math>\nwhere ''V<sub>k</sub>''  and ''I<sub>k</sub>'' are the RMS voltage and current magnitudes at harmonic ''k'' (<math>k = 1</math> denotes the fundamental frequency), and <math>P_{avg, 1}</math> is the conventional definition of power without factoring in harmonic components.\n\nThe power factor mentioned above is the displacement power factor.  There is another power factor that depends on THD.  True power factor can be taken to mean the ratio between average real power and the magnitude of RMS voltage and current, <math>pf_{true}=\\frac{P_{avg}}{V_{rms} I_{rms}}</math>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonics and How They Relate to Power Factor |url=http://intranet.ctism.ufsm.br/gsec/Apostilas/fatordepotenciaethd.pdf|work=Proc. of the EPRI Power Quality Issues & Opportunities Conference|author= W. Mack Grady and Robert Gilleski}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n{V_{rms}} = V_{1, rms} \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left(\\frac{ THD_V}{100}\\right)^2}\n</math>\nand\n:<math>\n{I_{rms}} = I_{1, rms} \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left(\\frac{ THD_I}{100}\\right)^2}\n</math>\n\nSubstituting this in for the equation for true power factor, it becomes clear that the quantity can be taken to have two components, one of which is the traditional power factor (neglecting the influence of harmonics) and one of which is the harmonics\u2019 contribution to power factor:\n\n:<math>\n{pf_{true}} = \\frac{ P_{avg}}{V_{1, rms} I_{1, rms}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{THD_V}{100}\\right)^2} \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{ THD_I}{100}\\right)^2}}.\n</math>\n\nNames are assigned to the two distinct factors as follows:\n:<math>\npf_{true} = pf_{disp} \\cdot pf_{dist},\n</math>\nwhere <math> pf_{disp}</math> is the displacement power factor and <math>\npf_{dist}</math> is the distortion power factor (i.e. the harmonics' contribution to total power factor).\n\n==Effects==\n\nOne of the major effects of power system harmonics is to increase the current in the system. This is particularly the case for the third harmonic, which causes a sharp increase in the [[Symmetrical components|zero sequence]] current, and therefore increases the current in the [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] conductor. This effect can require special consideration in the design of an electric system to serve non-linear loads.<ref>For example, see the [[National Electrical Code]]: \"A 3-phase, 4-wire, wye-connected power system used to supply power to nonlinear loads may necessitate that the power system design allow for the possibility of high harmonic neutral currents. (Article 220.61(C), FPN No. 2)\"</ref>\n\nIn addition to the increased line current, different pieces of electrical equipment can suffer effects from harmonics on the power system.\n\n===Motors===\nElectric motors experience losses due to [[hysteresis]] and [[eddy currents]] set up in the iron core of the motor. These are proportional to the frequency of the current.  Since the harmonics are at higher frequencies, they produce higher core losses in a motor than the power frequency would.  This results in increased heating of the motor core, which (if excessive) can shorten the life of the motor.  The 5th harmonic causes a CEMF (counter electromotive force) in large motors which acts in the opposite direction of rotation.  The CEMF is not large enough to counteract the rotation; however it does play a small role in the resulting rotating speed of the motor.\n\n===Telephones===\nIn the United States, common telephone lines are designed to transmit frequencies between 300 and 3400&nbsp;Hz. Since electric power in the United States is distributed at 60&nbsp;Hz, it normally does not interfere with telephone communications because its frequency is too low.\n\n==Sources==\nA pure sinusoidal voltage is a conceptual quantity produced by an ideal AC generator built with finely distributed stator and field windings that operate in a uniform magnetic field. Since neither the winding distribution nor the magnetic field are uniform in a working AC machine, voltage waveform distortions are created, and the voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists. Because this is a deviation from a pure sine wave, the deviation is in the form of a periodic function, and by definition, the voltage distortion contains harmonics.\n\nWhen a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a linear load, such as a heating element, the current through it is also sinusoidal. In non-linear loads, such as an amplifier with a clipping distortion, the voltage swing of the applied sinusoid is limited and the pure tone is polluted with a plethora of harmonics.\n\nWhen there is significant impedance in the path from the power source to a nonlinear load, these current distortions will also produce distortions in the voltage waveform at the load. However, in most cases where the power delivery system is functioning correctly under normal conditions, the voltage distortions will be quite small and can usually be ignored.\n\nWaveform distortion can be mathematically analysed to show that it is equivalent to superimposing additional frequency components onto a pure sinewave.  These frequencies are harmonics (integer multiples) of the fundamental frequency, and can sometimes propagate outwards from nonlinear loads, causing problems elsewhere on the power system.\n\nThe classic example of a non-linear load is a rectifier with a capacitor input filter, where the rectifier diode only allows current to pass to the load during the time that the applied voltage exceeds the voltage stored in the capacitor, which might be a relatively small portion of the incoming voltage cycle.\n\nOther examples of nonlinear loads are battery chargers, electronic ballasts, variable frequency drives, and switching mode power supplies.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Power factor]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.ecmweb.com/power-quality-reliability/article/20897053/effects-of-harmonics-on-power-systems\n |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |accessdate=2020-03-11 |last=Sankaran |first=C. |date=1999-10-01 |work=Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine |publisher=Penton Media, Inc}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electric power quality]]\n", "text_old": "{{Technical|date=October 2019}}\nIn an [[electric power system]], a '''harmonic''' is a voltage or current at a multiple of the fundamental frequency of the system, produced by the action of non-linear loads such as rectifiers, discharge lighting, or saturated magnetic devices.

Semiconductor devices like transistors, IGBTs, MOSFETS, diodes etc are all non-linear loads. Electric motors do not normally contribute significantly to harmonic generation. Both motors and transformers will however create harmonics when they are over-fluxed or saturated. Non-linear loads create disturbances in the pure sinusoidal waveform, and this may result in a large number of harmonics. The even harmonics do not normally exist in power system due to symmetry between the positive- and negative- halves of a cycle.  Further, if the waveforms of the three phases are symmetrical, the harmonic multiples of three are suppressed by delta (\u0394) connection of transformers and motors as described below.\n\nI we focus for example on only the third harmonic, we can see how all harmonics with a multiple of three behaves in powers systems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Harmonics Made Simple|url = http://ecmweb.com/archive/harmonics-made-simple|website = ecmweb.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}</ref>\n[[File:3rd orderHarmonics.png|thumb|330x330px|3rd Order Harmonic Addition]]\nPower is supplied by a three phase system, where each phase is 120 degrees apart. This is done for two reasons: mainly because three-phase generators and motors are simpler to construct due to constant torque developed across the three phase phases; and secondly, if the three phases are balanced, they sum to zero, and the size of neutral conductors can be reduced or even omitted in some cases. Both these measures results in significant costs savings to utility companies. However, the balanced third harmonic current will not add to zero in the neutral. As seen in the figure, the 3rd harmonic will add constructively across the three phases. This leads to an current in the neutral wire at three times the fundamental frequency, which can cause problems if the system is not designed for it, (i.e. conductors sized only for normal operation.)<ref name=\":0\" /> To reduce the effect of the third order harmonics [[Y-\u0394 transform|delta connections]] are used as attenuators, or third harmonic shorts as the current circulates in the delta the connection instead of flowing in the neutral of a [[Y-\u0394 transformer|wye connection]]. \n[[File:CFL Negative Power.png|thumb|right| A [[compact fluorescent lamp]] is one example of an electrical load with a non-linear characteristic, due to the [[rectifier]] circuit it uses. The current waveform, blue, is highly distorted.]]\n\n==Voltage harmonics==\nVoltage harmonics are mostly caused by current harmonics. The voltage provided by the voltage source will be distorted by current harmonics due to source impedance. If the source impedance of the voltage source is small, current harmonics will cause only small voltage harmonics.  It is typically the case that voltage harmonics are indeed small compared to current harmonics.  For that reason, the voltage waveform can usually be approximated by the [[fundamental frequency]] of voltage.  If this approximation is used, current harmonics produce no effect on the real power transferred to the load.  An intuitive way to see this comes from sketching the voltage wave at fundamental frequency and overlaying a current harmonic with no phase shift (in order to more easily observe the following phenomenon).  What can be observed is that for every period of voltage, there is equal area above the horizontal axis and below the current harmonic wave as there is below the axis and above the current harmonic wave.  This means that the average real power contributed by current harmonics is equal to zero.  However, if higher harmonics of voltage are considered, then current harmonics do make a contribution to the real power transferred to the load.\n\n==Total harmonic distortion==\n[[Total harmonic distortion]], or THD is a common measurement of the level of harmonic distortion present in power systems. THD can be related to either current harmonics or voltage harmonics, and it is defined as the ratio of total harmonics to the value at fundamental frequency times 100%.\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{THD_V} = \\frac{ \\sqrt{V_2^2 + V_3^2 + V_4^2 + \\cdots + V_n^2} }{V_1} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_{k \\mathop = 2}^{n}V_k^2} }{V_1} \\cdot 100\\%\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n{THD_I} = \\frac{ \\sqrt{I_2^2 + I_3^2 + I_4^2 + \\cdots + I_n^2} }{I_1} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_{k \\mathop = 2}^{n}I_k^2} }{I_1} \\cdot 100\\%\n</math>\n\nwhere ''V<sub>k</sub>'' is the RMS voltage of ''k''th harmonic, ''I<sub>k</sub>'' is the RMS current of the ''k''th harmonic,  and ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 is the fundamental frequency.\n\nIt is usually the case that we neglect higher voltage harmonics; however, if we do not neglect them, real power transferred to the load is affected by harmonics. Average real power can be found by adding the product of voltage and current (and power factor, denoted by ''pf'' here) at each higher frequency to the product of voltage and current at the fundamental frequency, or\n\n:<math>\n{P_{avg}} = \\sum_{k \\mathop = 1}^{\\infty} V_k \\cdot I_k \\cdot pf = P_{avg, 1} + P_{avg, 2} + \\cdots\n</math>\nwhere ''V<sub>k</sub>''  and ''I<sub>k</sub>'' are the RMS voltage and current magnitudes at harmonic ''k'' (<math>k = 1</math> denotes the fundamental frequency), and <math>P_{avg, 1}</math> is the conventional definition of power without factoring in harmonic components.\n\nThe power factor mentioned above is the displacement power factor.  There is another power factor that depends on THD.  True power factor can be taken to mean the ratio between average real power and the magnitude of RMS voltage and current, <math>pf_{true}=\\frac{P_{avg}}{V_{rms} I_{rms}}</math>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonics and How They Relate to Power Factor |url=http://intranet.ctism.ufsm.br/gsec/Apostilas/fatordepotenciaethd.pdf|work=Proc. of the EPRI Power Quality Issues & Opportunities Conference|author= W. Mack Grady and Robert Gilleski}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n{V_{rms}} = V_{1, rms} \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left(\\frac{ THD_V}{100}\\right)^2}\n</math>\nand\n:<math>\n{I_{rms}} = I_{1, rms} \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left(\\frac{ THD_I}{100}\\right)^2}\n</math>\n\nSubstituting this in for the equation for true power factor, it becomes clear that the quantity can be taken to have two components, one of which is the traditional power factor (neglecting the influence of harmonics) and one of which is the harmonics\u2019 contribution to power factor:\n\n:<math>\n{pf_{true}} = \\frac{ P_{avg}}{V_{1, rms} I_{1, rms}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{THD_V}{100}\\right)^2} \\sqrt{ 1 + \\left( \\frac{ THD_I}{100}\\right)^2}}.\n</math>\n\nNames are assigned to the two distinct factors as follows:\n:<math>\npf_{true} = pf_{disp} \\cdot pf_{dist},\n</math>\nwhere <math> pf_{disp}</math> is the displacement power factor and <math>\npf_{dist}</math> is the distortion power factor (i.e. the harmonics' contribution to total power factor).\n\n==Effects==\n\nOne of the major effects of power system harmonics is to increase the current in the system. This is particularly the case for the third harmonic, which causes a sharp increase in the [[Symmetrical components|zero sequence]] current, and therefore increases the current in the [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] conductor. This effect can require special consideration in the design of an electric system to serve non-linear loads.<ref>For example, see the [[National Electrical Code]]: \"A 3-phase, 4-wire, wye-connected power system used to supply power to nonlinear loads may necessitate that the power system design allow for the possibility of high harmonic neutral currents. (Article 220.61(C), FPN No. 2)\"</ref>\n\nIn addition to the increased line current, different pieces of electrical equipment can suffer effects from harmonics on the power system.\n\n===Motors===\nElectric motors experience losses due to [[hysteresis]] and [[eddy currents]] set up in the iron core of the motor. These are proportional to the frequency of the current.  Since the harmonics are at higher frequencies, they produce higher core losses in a motor than the power frequency would.  This results in increased heating of the motor core, which (if excessive) can shorten the life of the motor.  The 5th harmonic causes a CEMF (counter electromotive force) in large motors which acts in the opposite direction of rotation.  The CEMF is not large enough to counteract the rotation; however it does play a small role in the resulting rotating speed of the motor.\n\n===Telephones===\nIn the United States, common telephone lines are designed to transmit frequencies between 300 and 3400&nbsp;Hz. Since electric power in the United States is distributed at 60&nbsp;Hz, it normally does not interfere with telephone communications because its frequency is too low.\n\n==Sources==\nA pure sinusoidal voltage is a conceptual quantity produced by an ideal AC generator built with finely distributed stator and field windings that operate in a uniform magnetic field. Since neither the winding distribution nor the magnetic field are uniform in a working AC machine, voltage waveform distortions are created, and the voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists. Because this is a deviation from a pure sine wave, the deviation is in the form of a periodic function, and by definition, the voltage distortion contains harmonics.\n\nWhen a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a linear load, such as a heating element, the current through it is also sinusoidal. In non-linear loads, such as an amplifier with a clipping distortion, the voltage swing of the applied sinusoid is limited and the pure tone is polluted with a plethora of harmonics.\n\nWhen there is significant impedance in the path from the power source to a nonlinear load, these current distortions will also produce distortions in the voltage waveform at the load. However, in most cases where the power delivery system is functioning correctly under normal conditions, the voltage distortions will be quite small and can usually be ignored.\n\nWaveform distortion can be mathematically analysed to show that it is equivalent to superimposing additional frequency components onto a pure sinewave.  These frequencies are harmonics (integer multiples) of the fundamental frequency, and can sometimes propagate outwards from nonlinear loads, causing problems elsewhere on the power system.\n\nThe classic example of a non-linear load is a rectifier with a capacitor input filter, where the rectifier diode only allows current to pass to the load during the time that the applied voltage exceeds the voltage stored in the capacitor, which might be a relatively small portion of the incoming voltage cycle.\n\nOther examples of nonlinear loads are battery chargers, electronic ballasts, variable frequency drives, and switching mode power supplies.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Power factor]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.ecmweb.com/power-quality-reliability/article/20897053/effects-of-harmonics-on-power-systems\n |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |accessdate=2020-03-11 |last=Sankaran |first=C. |date=1999-10-01 |work=Electrical Construction and Maintenance Magazine |publisher=Penton Media, Inc}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electric power quality]]\n", "name_user": "Skvery", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurrent harmonics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonics_(electrical_power)"}

Supporters of the war believed that this was needed after [[New York City draft riots|the draft riots]] in [[New York City]] that year. Predominantly ethnic Irish mobs had protested the draft law, as wealthier men could buy substitutes rather than serve in the war.\n\nCarol Goodman, in \"Visualizing the Color Line,\" has argued that the photos alluded to physical and sexual abuse of the children's mothers. When publishing the photo of the eight former slaves, the editor of ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote that slavery permits slave-holding \"'gentlemen' [to] seduce [the] most friendless and defenseless of women.\" The specter of \"white\" girls being sold as \"fancy girls\" or [[concubines]] in Southern slave markets may have caused Northern families to fear for the safely of their own daughters.

Supporters of the war believed that this was needed after [[New York City draft riots|the draft riots]] in [[New York City]] that year. Predominantly ethnic Irish mobs had protested the draft law, as wealthier men could buy substitutes rather than serve in the war.\n\nCarol Goodman, in \"Visualizing the Color Line,\" has argued that the photos alluded to physical and sexual abuse of the children's mothers. When publishing the photo of the eight former slaves, the editor of ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote that slavery permits slave-holding \"'gentlemen' [to] seduce [the] most friendless and defenseless of women.\" The specter of \"white\" girls being sold as \"fancy girls\" or [[concubines]] in Southern slave markets may have caused Northern families to fear for the safely of their own daughters. Similarly, the idea that white slave-master fathers would sell their own children in slave markets raised Northerners' concerns.\n\n[[Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw]], in \"Portraits of a People,\" has argued that the usage of props, such as the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] and books, helped to provide context for Northern viewers, and also to emphasize that the purpose of the photos was to raise money for education of former slaves by funding schools in [[Louisiana]]. She also noted that the use of \"white\" children to illustrate the damage caused by institutional slavery, whose victims were overwhelmingly visibly people of color, demonstrated the contemporary racism of both Southern and Northern societies.<ref name=CaustEllenbogen />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Julia Chinn]]\n*[[Louisa Picquet]]\n*[[Mary Mildred Williams]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*{{cite book|last1=Tenzer|first1=Lawrence Raymond|title=The Forgotten Cause of the Civil War: A New Look at the Slavery Issue|date=1997|publisher=Scholars' Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGkOAQAAMAAJ}} See especially [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php/2001/10/01/white-slaves/ Ch.III]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5U-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA32-IA29&lpg=PA32-IA29#v=onepage&q&f=false Fremont Campaign Literature, 1856]\n*[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], [http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/02/how_mixed_are_african_americans/ Exactly How \u2018Black\u2019 Is Black America?]\n*{{cite book|last1=Janken|first1=Kenneth Robert|title=Walter White: Mr. NAACP|date=2006|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807857809|pages=3\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTVZ6N9vHxsC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|White slave propaganda}}\n{{Wikisource-inline|The Barbarism of Slavery}}\n*[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/white-slave-children-new-orleans-1860s-propaganda-campaign-gallery-1.1164989?pmSlide=0 Image gallery]\n\n[[Category:Abolitionism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Colorism]]\n[[Category:Propaganda in the United States]]\n[[Category:Skin pigmentation]]\n[[Category:Slavery in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rsk6400", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAbolitionist use of \"white slaves\":Reference corrected", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_slave_propaganda"}

By entering the building through the window, White managed to avoid the recently installed [[metal detector]]s. After entering Moscone's office, White pleaded to be reinstated as supervisor, but Moscone refused. White then killed Moscone by shooting him in the shoulder and chest, and twice in the head. He then walked to the other side of City Hall to Milk's office, reloaded the gun, and fatally shot Milk five times, the final two shots fired with the gun's barrel touching Milk's skull, according to the medical examiner. White then fled City Hall, turning himself in at the San Francisco's Northern Police Station where he had been a police officer. While being interviewed by investigators, White recorded a tearful confession, stating, \"I just shot him.\"\n\n===Trial and \"Twinkie defense\"===\n{{Main|Twinkie defense}}\nAt the trial, White's defense team argued that his mental state at the time of the killings was one of [[diminished capacity]] due to [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. They argued, therefore, he was not capable of [[premeditation|premeditating]] the killings, and thus was not legally guilty of [[first-degree murder]]. [[Forensic psychiatry|Forensic psychiatrist]] [[Martin Blinder]] testified that White was suffering from depression and pointed to several behavioral symptoms of that depression, including the fact that White had gone from being highly health-conscious to consuming sugary foods and drinks. When the prosecution played a recording of White's confession, several jurors wept as they listened to what was described as \"a man pushed beyond his endurance\". Many people familiar with City Hall claimed that it was common to enter through the window to save time. A police officer friend of White claimed to reporters that several officials carried weapons at this time and speculated that White carried the extra ammunition as a habit that police officers had. The jury found White guilty of voluntary [[manslaughter]] rather than [[first-degree murder]]. Outrage within San Francisco's [[gay community]] over the resulting seven-year sentence sparked the city's [[White Night riots]]; general disdain for the outcome of the court case led to the elimination of California's \"[[diminished capacity]]\" law.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Myth-of-the-Twinkie-defense-The-verdict-in-2511152.php |title=Myth of the 'Twinkie defense' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |last=Pogash |first=Carol |page=D-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3301/Daniel-James-White-Trial-1979-Double-Execution.html |title=Daniel James White Trial: 1979 \u2013 Double Execution |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |publisher=Net Industries |work=law.jrank.org}}</ref> Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], a critic of forensic psychiatry, gave a speech to a large audience in San Francisco in June 1979 calling the White verdict a \"travesty of justice\" which he blamed on the diminished capacity defense.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winer|first1=Paul|title=Was Psychiatry Dan White's Accomplice?|url=https://archive.org/stream/noevalleyvoice06unse_1/noevalleyvoice06unse_1_djvu.txt|via=archive.org|newspaper=Noe Valley Voice|date=July 1979|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=How Dan White Got Away With Murder|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/126032684/How-Dan-White-Got-Away-With-Murder-And-How-American-Psychiatry-Helped-Him-Do-it-by-Thomas-Szasz|journal=Inquiry|accessdate=March 18, 2017|location=San Francisco, California|pages=17\u201321|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment and suicide===\n[[File:Dan White headstone front.JPG|thumb|White's headstone.]]\nWhite served five years of his seven-year sentence at [[Correctional Training Facility|Soledad State Prison]] and was paroled on January 7, 1984.

In a controversial verdict that led to the coining of the legal slang \"[[Twinkie defense]]\", White was convicted of [[manslaughter]] rather than murder in the deaths of Milk and Moscone. White served five years of a seven-year prison sentence. Less than two years after his release he returned to San Francisco, where he ultimately committed [[suicide]].\n\n==Early life==\nWhite was born in [[Long Beach, California]],<ref>\"California Birth Index\", hosted at ancestry. \"Daniel James White, born September 2, 1946 Los Angeles County\"</ref> the second of nine children. He was raised by Irish-American, working-class parents in the [[Visitacion Valley, San Francisco|Visitacion Valley]] neighborhood of San Francisco.<ref name=john /> He attended [[Archbishop Riordan High School|Riordan High School]] until he was expelled for violence in his junior year.

He was a sergeant in the [[101st Airborne Division]] in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1969 to 1970 and was honorably discharged in 1971.\n\nWhite worked as a security guard at [[Dimond High School|A. J. Dimond High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], in 1972. He returned to San Francisco to work as a [[San Francisco Police Department|police officer]].

At that time, supervisors were elected by district and not \"[[at-large]]\", as they had been before and then were again in the 1980s and 1990s. He had strong support from the police and firefighter unions. His district was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as \"a largely white, middle-class section that is hostile to the growing [[LGBT culture in San Francisco|homosexual community of San Francisco]].\" ''The New York Times'' stated that as a supervisor, White saw himself as the board's \"defender of the home, the family and religious life against homosexuals, [[marijuana|pot]] smokers and cynics\".<ref name=nyt />\n\n===Tenure as supervisor===\nDespite their personal differences, White and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] had several areas of political agreement and initially worked well together.<ref name=john /> Harvey Milk was one of three people from the city hall invited to the [[baptism]] of White's newborn child shortly after the election.<ref name=john /> White also persuaded [[Dianne Feinstein]], then president of the board of supervisors, to appoint Milk chairman of the Streets and Transportation Committee.<ref name=john />\n\nThe Catholic Church in April 1978 proposed a facility for [[juvenile crime|juvenile offenders]] who had committed murder, arson, rape, and other crimes, to be operated by the [[Sisters of the Good Shepherd]], in White's district. White was strongly opposed, while Milk supported the facility, and their difference of opinion led to a conflict between the two.<ref name=john /> White held a mixed record on [[gay rights]], opposing the anti-gay [[Briggs Initiative]] (1978 California Proposition 6), yet voting against an ordinance prohibiting [[LGBT rights opposition|discrimination against gays]] in housing and employment.<ref name=john />\n\n==Assassinations of George Moscone and Harvey Milk==\n{{Main|Moscone\u2013Milk assassinations}}\nAfter a disagreement over a proposed drug rehabilitation center in the Mission District, White frequently clashed with Milk, as well as other members of the board.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harvey Milk: His Lives and Death|last=Lillian|first=Faderman|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780300222616|location=New Haven|pages=|oclc=1032649719}}</ref> On November 10, 1978, White resigned his seat as supervisor.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |first=Wallace |last=Turner |title=Suspect Sought Job |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/28/archives/suspect-sought-job-moscone-had-been-asked-to-reappoint-him-as-a.html|work=The New York Times |date=November 28, 1978|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> The reasons he cited were his dissatisfaction with what he saw as the corrupt inner workings of San Francisco city politics, as well as the difficulty in making a living without a police officer's or firefighter's salary, jobs he could not retain legally while serving as a supervisor. White had opened a baked-potato stand at [[Pier 39]], which failed to become profitable.<ref>Sides, Josh. ''Erotic City: Sexual Revolutions and the Making of San Francisco''.

On November 27, 1978, White visited [[San Francisco City Hall]] with the later-declared intention of killing not only Moscone and Milk, but also two other San Francisco politicians, California Assembly Speaker and later S.F. mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], and Supervisor [[Carol Ruth Silver]], whom he also blamed for lobbying Moscone not to reappoint him.<ref>Weiss, Mike. (September 18, 1998). \"Killer of Moscone, Milk had Willie Brown on List\", ''San Jose Mercury News'', Page A1</ref> He arrived that day by climbing through a first-floor window on the side of City Hall carrying a [[Smith & Wesson Model 36]] .38 caliber revolver and 10 rounds of ammunition. By entering the building through the window, White managed to avoid the recently installed [[metal detector]]s. After entering Moscone's office, White pleaded to be reinstated as supervisor, but Moscone refused. White then killed Moscone by shooting him in the shoulder and chest, and twice in the head. He then walked to the other side of City Hall to Milk's office, reloaded the gun, and fatally shot Milk five times, the final two shots fired with the gun's barrel touching Milk's skull, according to the medical examiner. White then fled City Hall, turning himself in at the San Francisco's Northern Police Station where he had been a police officer. While being interviewed by investigators, White recorded a tearful confession, stating, \"I just shot him.\"\n\n===Trial and \"Twinkie defense\"===\n{{Main|Twinkie defense}}\nAt the trial, White's defense team argued that his mental state at the time of the killings was one of [[diminished capacity]] due to [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. They argued, therefore, he was not capable of [[premeditation|premeditating]] the killings, and thus was not legally guilty of [[first-degree murder]]. [[Forensic psychiatry|Forensic psychiatrist]] [[Martin Blinder]] testified that White was suffering from depression and pointed to several behavioral symptoms of that depression, including the fact that White had gone from being highly health-conscious to consuming sugary foods and drinks. When the prosecution played a recording of White's confession, several jurors wept as they listened to what was described as \"a man pushed beyond his endurance\". Many people familiar with City Hall claimed that it was common to enter through the window to save time. A police officer friend of White claimed to reporters that several officials carried weapons at this time and speculated that White carried the extra ammunition as a habit that police officers had. The jury found White guilty of voluntary [[manslaughter]] rather than [[first-degree murder]]. Outrage within San Francisco's [[gay community]] over the resulting seven-year sentence sparked the city's [[White Night riots]]; general disdain for the outcome of the court case led to the elimination of California's \"[[diminished capacity]]\" law.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Myth-of-the-Twinkie-defense-The-verdict-in-2511152.php |title=Myth of the 'Twinkie defense' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |last=Pogash |first=Carol |page=D-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3301/Daniel-James-White-Trial-1979-Double-Execution.html |title=Daniel James White Trial: 1979 \u2013 Double Execution |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |publisher=Net Industries |work=law.jrank.org}}</ref> Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]], a critic of forensic psychiatry, gave a speech to a large audience in San Francisco in June 1979 calling the White verdict a \"travesty of justice\" which he blamed on the diminished capacity defense.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winer|first1=Paul|title=Was Psychiatry Dan White's Accomplice?|url=https://archive.org/stream/noevalleyvoice06unse_1/noevalleyvoice06unse_1_djvu.txt|via=archive.org|newspaper=Noe Valley Voice|date=July 1979|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=How Dan White Got Away With Murder|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/126032684/How-Dan-White-Got-Away-With-Murder-And-How-American-Psychiatry-Helped-Him-Do-it-by-Thomas-Szasz|journal=Inquiry|accessdate=March 18, 2017|location=San Francisco, California|pages=17\u201321|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment and suicide===\n[[File:Dan White headstone front.JPG|thumb|White's headstone.]]\nWhite served five years of his seven-year sentence at [[Correctional Training Facility|Soledad State Prison]] and was paroled on January 7, 1984.

They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]].

It is a member of the [[Rugby Group]] and though originally a major boys' public school in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular, [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed, re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. In memory of Haileyburians who died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], a war memorial [[obelisk]] made of portland stone and decorated with bronze, was erected on the main axis of the school's entrance front in 1903. It is known in the school as ''Obelisk'' and was designed by former pupil, [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, also designed by Sir Reginald, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity. [[Stuart Westley]], Master of Haileybury until July 2009, was responsible for making the school fully co-educational.<ref>''The Times'', Obituaries, July 2006</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nHaileybury serves as a co-educational school for 11- to 18-year-olds.  Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield.

It is a member of the [[Rugby Group]] and though originally a major boys' public school in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular, [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed, re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. In memory of Haileyburians who died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], a war memorial [[obelisk]] made of portland stone and decorated with bronze, was erected on the main axis of the school's entrance front in 1903. It is known in the school as ''Obelisk'' and was designed by former pupil, [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, also designed by Sir Reginald, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity. [[Stuart Westley]], Master of Haileybury until July 2009, was responsible for making the school fully co-educational.<ref>''The Times'', Obituaries, July 2006</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nHaileybury serves as a co-educational school for 11- to 18-year-olds.  Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997, the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by German organ builder, [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the [[Galbin]] region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

Zanno also noted that by the time of her study, there were numerous problems with the ''Segnosaurus'' IGM specimens, including damage caused since collection, the disappearance of elements of the holotype, incorrect identification of assigned elements, and more than one individual bearing the same specimen number. Holotype elements Zanno was able to access in 2010 included a severely damaged ilium, a sacrum missing the left sacral ribs with damage so it could not conjoin well with the rest of the ilium, and a pubic bone and ischium missing their upper portions.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology.

The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct.

One possibility is they dispersed through [[vicariance]], whereby therizinosaurs were present in the areas that became Asia and North America before the [[rifting]] that divided these areas in the [[Late Triassic]]. The other possibility is that basal therizinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America via Europe after the rifting event but before the middle [[Barremian]]; between 132\u2013138&nbsp;million years ago, a temporary [[land bridge]] connected North America and Europe, whereafter the landmasses were again isolated from each other, explaining why the basal therizinosaurs ''Beipiaosaurus'' from Asia and ''Falcarius'' from North America were so morphologically divergent from each other, though coeval. The presence of the derived therizinosaurid ''Nothronychus'', which was most-closely related to Asian genera, in North America during the [[Turonian]] stage of the early [[Late Cretaceous]] also shows there would have been a [[faunal interchange]] between North America and Asia via a late-Early Cretaceous land bridge before that (during the [[Aptian]]/[[Albian]]), which is also seen in some other dinosaur groups.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Therizinosaurs.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed skeletons of the North American therizinosaurs ''[[Nothronychus]]'' (large) and ''[[Falcarius]]'', in modern, bipedal postures, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]]\n\nIn 1979 and 1981, Barsbold and Perle said the short, massive metatarsus and unusually large, splayed toes indicated that ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives were not adapted for rapid locomotion, perhaps because it was not required by their lifestyle; Barsbold and Perle suggested they could have been [[Semiaquatic|amphibious]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |last2=Perle |first2=A. |author2-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Modiphikatsiy tasa sayrisziy i parallelinoe rasvitie zishchnich dinosavrov |trans-title=Modification in the saurischian pelvis and the parallel development of predatory dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=8 |pages=39\u201344|language=Russian|translator-last=Welsh |translator-first=W.

Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the [[Galbin]] region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

The pelvis was shortened at the front, a feature found among bird-like theropods but uncommon among theropods as a whole.<ref name=Perle1979/> The pubic bone was directed backwards and down in parallel with the ischium; this backwards orientation of the pubic bone is known as the {{Dinogloss|opisthopubic}} condition.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives.

Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks.

While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by [[ventilatory muscles]] that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation\u2014breathing with extra [[air sacs]]\u2014which shows the importance of this mode of respiration.<ref name=\"Macaluso\">{{cite journal |last1=Macaluso |first1=L. |last2=Tschopp |first2=E. |last3=Mannion |first3=P. |title=Evolutionary changes in pubic orientation in dinosaurs are more strongly correlated with the ventilation system than with herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2018 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=703\u2013719 |doi=10.1111/pala.12362}}</ref> In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders\u2014moving their jaws up and down\u2014and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occluded]] (contacted each other) at once.

Button and Zanno found in 2019 herbivorous dinosaurs mainly followed two distinct modes of feeding, either processing food in the gut\u2014characterized by gracile skulls and low bite forces\u2014or the mouth, characterized by features associated with extensive processing. ''Segnosaurus'', along with [[diplodocoid]] and titanosaur sauropods, deinocheirid and ornithomimid ornithomimosaurs, and [[caenagnathids]], was found to be in the former category, whereas ''Erlikosaurus'' was more similar to some sauropodomorph and ornithischian taxa, indicating these two therizinosaurs were functionally separated and occupied different niches.<ref name=\"DivergentHerbivory\">{{cite journal |last1=Button |first1=D.
