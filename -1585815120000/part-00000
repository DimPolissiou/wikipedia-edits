Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved, and changes in heat settings are instantaneous.<ref name=acee/>\n\nIn an induction [[cooktop]] (\"induction hob\" or \"induction stove\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot and an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] is passed through it. The resulting oscillating [[magnetic field]] [[wireless power transfer|wirelessly]] induces an electrical current in the pot.  This large [[eddy current]] flowing through the resistance of the pot results in resistive heating.\n\nFor nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as [[cast iron]] or some [[stainless steel]]s. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current;  \"all metal\" induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.\n\nInduction cooking has good electrical coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it puts less [[waste heat]] into the kitchen, can be quickly turned on and off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot.\n\n==Cooking properties==\n\n[[File:Induction Cooktop Rolling Boil.jpg|thumb|alt=A pot of boiling water atop newspaper on an induction cooking surface|An induction cooking surface boiling water through several layers of newsprint. The paper is undamaged since heat is produced only in the bottom of the pot]]\n\n===Power and control===\nInduction cooking provides fast heating, improved [[thermal efficiency]], and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g0Z4CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA682&dq=induction%20cooking&pg=PA682#v=onepage&q=induction%20cooking&f=false |title = Wireless Power Transfer|isbn = 9788793237629|last1 = Agbinya|first1 = Johnson I.|date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> The induction elements commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial [[gas burner]], but are significantly more energy-efficient. Induction cooking is generally digitally controlled which provides precise control of the power and cooking temperature. This makes it possible to boil a pot rapidly, and then keep a pot just simmering.\n\n===Safety===\nThe unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated.\n\nThe control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot- a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.\n\n===Cooker surface===\nThe surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a hazardous temperature. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick.\n\nInduction cookers generally have low-thermal expansion glass ceramic tops that can be damaged by sufficient impact although they are required to meet minimum specified product safety standards with regard to impact.<ref>Hans Bach, Dieter Krause, ''Low thermal expansion glass ceramics'', Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24111-6}} page 77, lists IEC, UL, Canadian, Australian and other standards with impact resistance requirements</ref> Aluminum foil can melt onto the top and cause permanent damage or cracking of the top. Surfaces can be scratched by sliding pans across the cooking surface.\n\n===Noise===\nSome noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Also, [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|audible electromagnetically induced acoustic noise]] (a high pitched hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the multi-ply layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing or more sensitive to this high-frequency whine.\n\n===Other considerations===\nSome cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with implanted [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields; the medical literature seems to suggest that proximity to induction cooking surfaces is safe, but individuals with such implants should always check first with their cardiologists. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nBecause the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top.\n\n===Efficiency===\n\nThe 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that \"induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric\ntechnology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the\nefficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of\nthe cooking vessel.\"<ref>https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf</ref> Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.\n\nThe purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required.  A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop to some theoretical value required to prepare the specified food.  Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.\n\nEnergy transfer efficiency, as defined by [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle, appears to have been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.\n\nThe DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at room temperature: 77&nbsp;\u00b0F \u00b1 9&nbsp;\u00b0F (25&nbsp;\u00b0C \u00b1 5&nbsp;\u00b0C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144&nbsp;\u00b0F (+80&nbsp;\u00b0C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% \u00b1 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appI.pdf#page=6|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix I: Uniform test method for measuring the energy consumption of conventional ranges, conventional cooking tops, conventional ovens, and microwave ovens|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.\n\nSuch a test, using a combination of two different power levels, was conceived to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are simply disregarded and don't contribute to efficiency.\n\nIn typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food up to temperature; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation from the pan sides. Since there is no increase in the food temperature, the DOE test procedure would consider the efficiency substantially zero. Cooking procedures such as [[Reduction (cooking)|reduction]] of a sauce, [[braising]] meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the DOE test procedure.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, so it is suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with \u00b10.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that \"induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth\u2014electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units\".<ref name=\"DOE2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-03/pdf/2014-28212.pdf#page=17 |title=Federal Register, Vol. 79 No. 232, December 3 2014, Part III, Department of Energy, Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Conventional Cooking Products; Proposed Rule|format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Moreover, DOE reminds that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories but just \"referenced from an external test study\" performed in 1992.<ref name=\"DOE2014\" />\n\nIn addition independent tests conducted by manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |title=Electrolux sustainability |format=pdf |accessdate=2016-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919100541/http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |archivedate=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }} See slide # 57</ref>  research laboratories<ref name=acee>{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf |title=Induction Cooking Technology Design and Assessment; M.

It can be raised only by using special pots with fins whose first design and commercialization came years ago,<ref name=\"gasefficiency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |title=Improving Range-Top Efficiency with Specialized Vessels |author=Greg Sorensen |author2=David Zabrowski |date=August 2009 |publisher=Appliance Magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154301/http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> but that have been recently rediscovered, redesigned in a different way and put again on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |title=Oxford-designed Flare pan uses 40 per cent less heat than conventional pans \u2014 Department of Engineering Science \u2014 University of Oxford |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928005335/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |archive-date=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> So for environmental considerations dealing with induction versus gas, a 40% gas efficiency will be used.\n\nWhen comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of the process by which electricity is generated, affect both overall environmental efficiency<ref>[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/appliances/cookers.aspx Shopping guide to Gas & Electric Cookers, Ovens & Hobs, from Ethical Consumer]. \"The low CO<sub>2</sub> choice is pretty much always gas, where it is available. Although gas ovens and hobs use more energy, gas generates less carbon dioxide per kWh.\"</ref> (as explained in more detail below) and cost to the user.\n\n===Kitchen ventilation===\nEnergy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, the losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen itself and can affect the amount of ventilation required.\n\nGas cooking efficiencies may be lower if waste heat generation is taken into account.  Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas.  Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas.  Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule.  Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.\n\nIn a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.\n\n{{anchor|inductive_coupling_coils}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Induktionskochfeld Spule.jpg|thumb|Inside view of an induction cooker: the large copper coil forms the magnetic field, a cooling fan is visible below it, and power supply and [[line filter]] surround the coil. In the centre of the coil is a temperature sensor, covered in white [[thermal grease]]]]\n[[File:InductionsStove 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Ventilation slots visible. The unit has a small depth compared to the width of the stove|Side view of an induction stove]]\nAn induction cooker transfers electrical energy by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] from a coil of wire into a  metal vessel that must be [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a high frequency (e.g. 24&nbsp;kHz)  [[alternating current]] is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. When an [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] pot is brought close to the cooking surface, and the pan is thicker than the [[skin depth]], the magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s in the pot. The eddy currents flow through the [[electrical resistance]] of the pot to produce heat through [[Joule heating]]; the pot then in turn heats its contents by [[heat conduction]].\n\nThe cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]]. The increased [[magnetic permeability]] of the material decreases the [[skin depth]], concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from [[litz wire]], which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a [[transformer]] that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.\n\nOften a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but also can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.\n\n===Applications===\n\nInduction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting [[glass-ceramic]] sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.\n\nIn [[Japan]], some models of [[rice cooker]]s are powered by induction. In Hong Kong, power companies list a number of models. Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces; efficient, low-waste-heat units are advantageous in densely populated cities with little living space per family, as many Asian cities are. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.\n\nInduction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens. Electric cooking avoids the cost of natural gas piping and in some jurisdictions may allow simpler ventilation and fire suppression equipment to be installed.<ref>Roger Fields, ''Restaurant Success by the Numbers: A Money-Guy's Guide to Opening the Next Hot Spot'', Random House of Canada, 2007 {{ISBN|1-58008-663-2}}, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.\n\n===Controls===\n\nThe [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of a steel vessel concentrate the induced current in a thin layer near its surface, which results in a strong heating effect. In [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic materials]] like aluminum, the magnetic field penetrates deeper, and the induced current encounters little resistance in the metal.<ref>{{cite book|url-status=dead|chapter=A comparative study of resonant inverter topologies used in induction cookers|author1=Llorente, S. |title=APEC.

At least one high-frequency \"all-metal\" cooker is available, that works with lower efficiency on non-ferromagnetic metal cookware.\n\nThe cooking surface is made of a [[glass-ceramic]] material which is a poor heat conductor, so only a little heat is lost through the bottom of the pot. In normal operation the cooking surface stays significantly cooler than with other stove cooking methods, but still needs to cool down before it can be safely touched.\n\nUnits may have one, two, three, four or five induction zones, but four (normally in a 30-inch-wide unit) is the most common in the US and Europe. Two coils are most common in Hong Kong and three are most common in Japan. Some have touch-sensitive controls. Some induction stoves have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a \"zoneless\" induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five utensils to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, not just on pre-defined zones.<ref>[http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf DeDietrich \"Piano\" cooktop specifications, retrieved 2012 May 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032647/http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, dedietrich.co.uk</ref>\n\nSmall stand-alone portable induction cookers are relatively inexpensive, priced from around {{US$|20}} in some markets.\n\n===Cookware===\n\n[[File:Induction-label-de.svg|thumb|Cookware may carry a symbol that identifies it as compatible with an induction cooktop]]\n\nCookware must be compatible with induction heating; in most models, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Special and costly wok-shaped tops are available for use with round-bottom [[wok]]s.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.\n\nInduction compatible cookware for an induction cooking surface can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \"all-metal\" cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.\n\nAluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials\u2019 [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic]] and [[resistivity|electrical]] properties.<ref name=Moreland73>W. C. Moreland, ''The Induction Range: Its Performance and Its Development Problems'', IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, vol. TA-9, no. 1, January/February 1973 pages 81\u201386</ref> Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel, but the [[skin depth]] in these materials is larger since they are non-magnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal, encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots. However, aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this 'tri-ply' pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.\n\nFor frying, a pan with a base that is a good heat conductor is needed to spread the heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into the aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.\n\nWhen boiling water, the circulating water spreads the heat and prevents hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, allowing the cook to heat the sauce rapidly but evenly.\n\n[[File:Foil on induction cooktop.jpg|thumb|alt=Aluminum foil in a square Pyrex dish of water, with a tear where the foil has melted| Household foil is much thinner than the skin depth in aluminum at the frequencies used by an induction cooker. Here the foil has melted where it was exposed to the air after steam formed under it. Cooking surface manufacturers prohibit the use of aluminum foil in contact with an induction cooking surface]]\n\nThe heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a \u201cfigure of merit\u201d that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some common materials are listed in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Skin depth at 24&nbsp;kHz<ref name=Moreland73/>\n!

Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24&nbsp;kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s used were limited to no more than 40&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=Moreland73/> Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some additional heat is created by [[hysteresis loss]]es in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|title=AN9012 Induction Heating System Topology Review|author=Fairchild Semiconductors|date=July 2000|accessdate=2009-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724205258/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===\"All-metal\" models===\n\nNew types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible.\n\nPanasonic Corporation in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Fujita |first=Atsushi |author2=Sadakata, Hideki |author3=Hirota, Izuo |author4=Omori, Hideki |author5=Nakaoka, Mutsuo |title=Latest developments of high-frequency series load resonant inverter type built-in cooktops for induction heated all metallic appliances |conference=Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009.

It used paralleled [[Delco Electronics]] transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25&nbsp;kHz current.\n\n[[File:Westinghouse CT-2 Induction Range photograph 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Westinghouse Electric CT-2; the first production induction range from 1973]]\nWestinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).\n\nProduction took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to [[White Consolidated Industries]] Inc.\n\nCT2 had four \"burners\" of about 1,600 watts each, measured by calorimetry. The range top was a [[Pyroceram]] ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding [[potentiometer]]s set below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules which were cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.\n\nIn each of the electronics modules, the 240 V, 60&nbsp;Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20 V to 200 V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled [[rectifier]]. That DC power was in turn converted to 27&nbsp;kHz 30&nbsp;A (peak) AC by two arrays of six paralleled [[Motorola]] automotive-ignition transistors in a half-bridge configuration driving a series-resonant [[LC circuit|LC]] [[oscillator]], of which the inductor component was the induction-heating coil and its load, the cooking pan. The circuit design, largely by Ray Mackenzie,<ref>{{US Patent|3889090|Induction Heat Cooking Apparatus|Raymond W Mackenzie}}</ref> successfully dealt with certain bothersome overload problems.\n\nControl electronics included functions such as protection against over-heated cook-pans and overloads. Provision was made to reduce radiated electrical and magnetic fields.<ref>{{US Patent|4163139|Cooking vessel capacitive decoupling for induction cooking apparatus|Terence D Malarkey et al}}</ref><ref>{{US Patent|3996442|Induction heating coil assembly for heating cooking vessels|William C Moreland II et al}}</ref> There was also magnetic pan detection.<ref>{{US Patent|3796850|Pan detector for induction heating cooking unit|William C Moreland II et al}}</ref>\n\nCT2 was [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] Listed and received [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval, both firsts. Numerous patents were also issued. CT2 won several awards, including Industrial Research Magazine's IR-100 1972 best-product award <ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/RD100SearchResults.aspx?&strCompany=Westinghouse&Type=C Archive, retrieved 2012 Aug 22], rdmag.com {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and a citation from the United States Steel Association. [[Raymond Baxter]] demonstrated the CT2 on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''. He showed how the CT2 could cook through a slab of ice.\n\n[[Kenmore Appliances|Sears Kenmore]] sold a free-standing oven/stove with four induction-cooking surfaces in the mid-1980s (Model Number 103.9647910). The unit also featured a [[self-cleaning oven]], solid-state kitchen timer and capacitive-touch control buttons (advanced for its time). The units were more expensive than standard cooking surfaces.\n\nIn 2009 [[Panasonic]] developed an all-metal induction cooker that used frequencies up to 120&nbsp;kHz,<ref>https://www.sefa.com/panasonic-takes-induction-next-level/ \"Panasonic takes induction to the next level\", retrieved September 19, 2018</ref> three to five times higher than other cooktops,  to work with non-ferrous metal cookware.\n\n===Vendors===\n\nThe market for induction stoves is dominated by German manufacturers.\n\nSingle ring portable hobs have become popular in the UK, with prices as low as \u00a330 from discounters.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe European induction cooking market for hotels, restaurants and other caterers is primarily satisfied by smaller specialist commercial induction catering equipment manufacturers.\n\nTaiwanese and Japanese electronics companies are the dominant players in induction cooking for East Asia. After aggressive promotions by utilities in HK, many local brands emerged. Their power and ratings are high, more than 2,800 watts. Some of these companies have also started marketing in the West. However, the product range sold in Western markets is a subset of that in their domestic market; some Japanese electronics manufacturers only sell domestically.\n\nIn the United States, as of early 2013 there are over five dozen brands of induction-cooking equipment available, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment.  Even restricting to build-in residential-use units, there are over two dozen brands being sold; residential countertop units add another two-dozen-plus brands to the count.\n\nPortable induction cooktops vary depending on power and features from the other cooktop. It builds with the same ranges as a normal induction cooktop.<ref>[https://homekitchenary.com/best-portable-induction-cooktop/ ''Homekitchenary induction cooktop Appliance Upgrades that Shine'', retrieved 2020 Apr 02], https://homekitchenary.com/</ref> portable induction cooktop is another improvement of an induction cooktop. Both were madeup with the same technology. It provides magnetic technology instead of providing a heat sources to cook.\n\nIn April 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that \"In an independent survey last summer by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. . . .

Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved, and changes in heat settings are instantaneous.<ref name=acee/>\n\nIn an induction [[cooktop]] (\"induction hob\" or \"induction stove\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot and an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] is passed through it. The resulting oscillating [[magnetic field]] [[wireless power transfer|wirelessly]] induces an electrical current in the pot.  This large [[eddy current]] flowing through the resistance of the pot results in resistive heating.\n\nFor nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as [[cast iron]] or some [[stainless steel]]s. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current;  \"all metal\" induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.\n\nInduction cooking has good electrical coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it puts less [[waste heat]] into the kitchen, can be quickly turned on and off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot.\n\n==Cooking properties==\n\n[[File:Induction Cooktop Rolling Boil.jpg|thumb|alt=A pot of boiling water atop newspaper on an induction cooking surface|An induction cooking surface boiling water through several layers of newsprint. The paper is undamaged since heat is produced only in the bottom of the pot]]\n\n===Power and control===\nInduction cooking provides fast heating, improved [[thermal efficiency]], and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g0Z4CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA682&dq=induction%20cooking&pg=PA682#v=onepage&q=induction%20cooking&f=false |title = Wireless Power Transfer|isbn = 9788793237629|last1 = Agbinya|first1 = Johnson I.|date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> The induction elements commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial [[gas burner]], but are significantly more energy-efficient. Induction cooking is generally digitally controlled which provides precise control of the power and cooking temperature. This makes it possible to boil a pot rapidly, and then keep a pot just simmering.\n\n===Safety===\nThe unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated.\n\nThe control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot- a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.\n\n===Cooker surface===\nThe surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a hazardous temperature. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick.\n\nInduction cookers generally have low-thermal expansion glass ceramic tops that can be damaged by sufficient impact although they are required to meet minimum specified product safety standards with regard to impact.<ref>Hans Bach, Dieter Krause, ''Low thermal expansion glass ceramics'', Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24111-6}} page 77, lists IEC, UL, Canadian, Australian and other standards with impact resistance requirements</ref> Aluminum foil can melt onto the top and cause permanent damage or cracking of the top. Surfaces can be scratched by sliding pans across the cooking surface.\n\n===Noise===\nSome noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Also, [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|audible electromagnetically induced acoustic noise]] (a high pitched hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the multi-ply layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing or more sensitive to this high-frequency whine.\n\n===Other considerations===\nSome cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with implanted [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields; the medical literature seems to suggest that proximity to induction cooking surfaces is safe, but individuals with such implants should always check first with their cardiologists. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nBecause the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top.\n\n===Efficiency===\n\nThe 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that \"induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric\ntechnology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the\nefficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of\nthe cooking vessel.\"<ref>https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf</ref> Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.\n\nThe purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required.  A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop to some theoretical value required to prepare the specified food.  Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.\n\nEnergy transfer efficiency, as defined by [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle, appears to have been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.\n\nThe DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at room temperature: 77&nbsp;\u00b0F \u00b1 9&nbsp;\u00b0F (25&nbsp;\u00b0C \u00b1 5&nbsp;\u00b0C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144&nbsp;\u00b0F (+80&nbsp;\u00b0C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% \u00b1 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appI.pdf#page=6|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix I: Uniform test method for measuring the energy consumption of conventional ranges, conventional cooking tops, conventional ovens, and microwave ovens|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.\n\nSuch a test, using a combination of two different power levels, was conceived to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are simply disregarded and don't contribute to efficiency.\n\nIn typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food up to temperature; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation from the pan sides. Since there is no increase in the food temperature, the DOE test procedure would consider the efficiency substantially zero. Cooking procedures such as [[Reduction (cooking)|reduction]] of a sauce, [[braising]] meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the DOE test procedure.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, so it is suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with \u00b10.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that \"induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth\u2014electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units\".<ref name=\"DOE2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-03/pdf/2014-28212.pdf#page=17 |title=Federal Register, Vol. 79 No. 232, December 3 2014, Part III, Department of Energy, Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Conventional Cooking Products; Proposed Rule|format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Moreover, DOE reminds that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories but just \"referenced from an external test study\" performed in 1992.<ref name=\"DOE2014\" />\n\nIn addition independent tests conducted by manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |title=Electrolux sustainability |format=pdf |accessdate=2016-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919100541/http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |archivedate=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }} See slide # 57</ref>  research laboratories<ref name=acee>{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf |title=Induction Cooking Technology Design and Assessment; M.

It can be raised only by using special pots with fins whose first design and commercialization came years ago,<ref name=\"gasefficiency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |title=Improving Range-Top Efficiency with Specialized Vessels |author=Greg Sorensen |author2=David Zabrowski |date=August 2009 |publisher=Appliance Magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154301/http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> but that have been recently rediscovered, redesigned in a different way and put again on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |title=Oxford-designed Flare pan uses 40 per cent less heat than conventional pans \u2014 Department of Engineering Science \u2014 University of Oxford |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928005335/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |archive-date=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> So for environmental considerations dealing with induction versus gas, a 40% gas efficiency will be used.\n\nWhen comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of the process by which electricity is generated, affect both overall environmental efficiency<ref>[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/appliances/cookers.aspx Shopping guide to Gas & Electric Cookers, Ovens & Hobs, from Ethical Consumer]. \"The low CO<sub>2</sub> choice is pretty much always gas, where it is available. Although gas ovens and hobs use more energy, gas generates less carbon dioxide per kWh.\"</ref> (as explained in more detail below) and cost to the user.\n\n===Kitchen ventilation===\nEnergy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, the losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen itself and can affect the amount of ventilation required.\n\nGas cooking efficiencies may be lower if waste heat generation is taken into account.  Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas.  Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas.  Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule.  Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.\n\nIn a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.\n\n{{anchor|inductive_coupling_coils}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Induktionskochfeld Spule.jpg|thumb|Inside view of an induction cooker: the large copper coil forms the magnetic field, a cooling fan is visible below it, and power supply and [[line filter]] surround the coil. In the centre of the coil is a temperature sensor, covered in white [[thermal grease]]]]\n[[File:InductionsStove 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Ventilation slots visible. The unit has a small depth compared to the width of the stove|Side view of an induction stove]]\nAn induction cooker transfers electrical energy by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] from a coil of wire into a  metal vessel that must be [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a high frequency (e.g. 24&nbsp;kHz)  [[alternating current]] is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. When an [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] pot is brought close to the cooking surface, and the pan is thicker than the [[skin depth]], the magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s in the pot. The eddy currents flow through the [[electrical resistance]] of the pot to produce heat through [[Joule heating]]; the pot then in turn heats its contents by [[heat conduction]].\n\nThe cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]]. The increased [[magnetic permeability]] of the material decreases the [[skin depth]], concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from [[litz wire]], which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a [[transformer]] that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.\n\nOften a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but also can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.\n\n===Applications===\n\nInduction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting [[glass-ceramic]] sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.\n\nIn [[Japan]], some models of [[rice cooker]]s are powered by induction. In Hong Kong, power companies list a number of models. Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces; efficient, low-waste-heat units are advantageous in densely populated cities with little living space per family, as many Asian cities are. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.\n\nInduction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens. Electric cooking avoids the cost of natural gas piping and in some jurisdictions may allow simpler ventilation and fire suppression equipment to be installed.<ref>Roger Fields, ''Restaurant Success by the Numbers: A Money-Guy's Guide to Opening the Next Hot Spot'', Random House of Canada, 2007 {{ISBN|1-58008-663-2}}, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.\n\n===Controls===\n\nThe [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of a steel vessel concentrate the induced current in a thin layer near its surface, which results in a strong heating effect. In [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic materials]] like aluminum, the magnetic field penetrates deeper, and the induced current encounters little resistance in the metal.<ref>{{cite book|url-status=dead|chapter=A comparative study of resonant inverter topologies used in induction cookers|author1=Llorente, S. |title=APEC.

At least one high-frequency \"all-metal\" cooker is available, that works with lower efficiency on non-ferromagnetic metal cookware.\n\nThe cooking surface is made of a [[glass-ceramic]] material which is a poor heat conductor, so only a little heat is lost through the bottom of the pot. In normal operation the cooking surface stays significantly cooler than with other stove cooking methods, but still needs to cool down before it can be safely touched.\n\nUnits may have one, two, three, four or five induction zones, but four (normally in a 30-inch-wide unit) is the most common in the US and Europe. Two coils are most common in Hong Kong and three are most common in Japan. Some have touch-sensitive controls. Some induction stoves have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a \"zoneless\" induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five utensils to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, not just on pre-defined zones.<ref>[http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf DeDietrich \"Piano\" cooktop specifications, retrieved 2012 May 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032647/http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, dedietrich.co.uk</ref>\n\nSmall stand-alone portable induction cookers are relatively inexpensive, priced from around {{US$|20}} in some markets.\n\n===Cookware===\n\n[[File:Induction-label-de.svg|thumb|Cookware may carry a symbol that identifies it as compatible with an induction cooktop]]\n\nCookware must be compatible with induction heating; in most models, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Special and costly wok-shaped tops are available for use with round-bottom [[wok]]s.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.\n\nInduction compatible cookware for an induction cooking surface can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \"all-metal\" cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.\n\nAluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials\u2019 [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic]] and [[resistivity|electrical]] properties.<ref name=Moreland73>W. C. Moreland, ''The Induction Range: Its Performance and Its Development Problems'', IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, vol. TA-9, no. 1, January/February 1973 pages 81\u201386</ref> Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel, but the [[skin depth]] in these materials is larger since they are non-magnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal, encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots. However, aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this 'tri-ply' pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.\n\nFor frying, a pan with a base that is a good heat conductor is needed to spread the heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into the aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.\n\nWhen boiling water, the circulating water spreads the heat and prevents hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, allowing the cook to heat the sauce rapidly but evenly.\n\n[[File:Foil on induction cooktop.jpg|thumb|alt=Aluminum foil in a square Pyrex dish of water, with a tear where the foil has melted| Household foil is much thinner than the skin depth in aluminum at the frequencies used by an induction cooker.

Cooking surface manufacturers prohibit the use of aluminum foil in contact with an induction cooking surface]]\n\nThe heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a \u201cfigure of merit\u201d that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some common materials are listed in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Skin depth at 24&nbsp;kHz<ref name=Moreland73/>\n!

Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24&nbsp;kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s used were limited to no more than 40&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=Moreland73/> Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some additional heat is created by [[hysteresis loss]]es in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|title=AN9012 Induction Heating System Topology Review|author=Fairchild Semiconductors|date=July 2000|accessdate=2009-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724205258/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===\"All-metal\" models===\n\nNew types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible.\n\nPanasonic Corporation in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Fujita |first=Atsushi |author2=Sadakata, Hideki |author3=Hirota, Izuo |author4=Omori, Hideki |author5=Nakaoka, Mutsuo |title=Latest developments of high-frequency series load resonant inverter type built-in cooktops for induction heated all metallic appliances |conference=Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009.

Unlike this concept, a modern cooking surface uses electronically generated high-frequency current]]\nFirst patents date from the early 1900s.<ref>for example see UK Patent Application GB190612333, entitled \"Improvements in or relating to Apparatus for the Electrical Production of Heat for Cooking and other purposes\", applied for by Arthur F. Berry on 26 May 1906</ref> Demonstration stoves were shown by the Frigidaire division of General Motors in the mid-1950s<ref>''Kitchen of the Future has Glass-Dome Oven and Automatic Food Mixer'', Popular Mechanics Apr 1956, page 88</ref> on a touring GM showcase in North America. The induction cooker was shown heating a pot of water with a newspaper placed between the stove and the pot, to demonstrate the convenience and safety. This unit, however, was never put into production.\n\nModern implementation in the USA dates from the early 1970s, with work done at the Research & Development Center of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] at Churchill Borough, near [[Pittsburgh]],<ref name=Moreland73/> That work was first put on public display at the 1971 [[National Association of Home Builders]] convention in Houston, Texas, as part of the Westinghouse Consumer Products Division display.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The stand-alone single-burner range was named the Cool Top Induction Range. It used paralleled [[Delco Electronics]] transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25&nbsp;kHz current.\n\n[[File:Westinghouse CT-2 Induction Range photograph 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Westinghouse Electric CT-2; the first production induction range from 1973]]\nWestinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).\n\nProduction took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to [[White Consolidated Industries]] Inc.\n\nCT2 had four \"burners\" of about 1,600 watts each, measured by calorimetry. The range top was a [[Pyroceram]] ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding [[potentiometer]]s set below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules which were cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.\n\nIn each of the electronics modules, the 240 V, 60&nbsp;Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20 V to 200 V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled [[rectifier]]. That DC power was in turn converted to 27&nbsp;kHz 30&nbsp;A (peak) AC by two arrays of six paralleled [[Motorola]] automotive-ignition transistors in a half-bridge configuration driving a series-resonant [[LC circuit|LC]] [[oscillator]], of which the inductor component was the induction-heating coil and its load, the cooking pan. The circuit design, largely by Ray Mackenzie,<ref>{{US Patent|3889090|Induction Heat Cooking Apparatus|Raymond W Mackenzie}}</ref> successfully dealt with certain bothersome overload problems.\n\nControl electronics included functions such as protection against over-heated cook-pans and overloads. Provision was made to reduce radiated electrical and magnetic fields.<ref>{{US Patent|4163139|Cooking vessel capacitive decoupling for induction cooking apparatus|Terence D Malarkey et al}}</ref><ref>{{US Patent|3996442|Induction heating coil assembly for heating cooking vessels|William C Moreland II et al}}</ref> There was also magnetic pan detection.<ref>{{US Patent|3796850|Pan detector for induction heating cooking unit|William C Moreland II et al}}</ref>\n\nCT2 was [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] Listed and received [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval, both firsts. Numerous patents were also issued. CT2 won several awards, including Industrial Research Magazine's IR-100 1972 best-product award <ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/RD100SearchResults.aspx?&strCompany=Westinghouse&Type=C Archive, retrieved 2012 Aug 22], rdmag.com {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and a citation from the United States Steel Association. [[Raymond Baxter]] demonstrated the CT2 on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''. He showed how the CT2 could cook through a slab of ice.\n\n[[Kenmore Appliances|Sears Kenmore]] sold a free-standing oven/stove with four induction-cooking surfaces in the mid-1980s (Model Number 103.9647910). The unit also featured a [[self-cleaning oven]], solid-state kitchen timer and capacitive-touch control buttons (advanced for its time). The units were more expensive than standard cooking surfaces.\n\nIn 2009 [[Panasonic]] developed an all-metal induction cooker that used frequencies up to 120&nbsp;kHz,<ref>https://www.sefa.com/panasonic-takes-induction-next-level/ \"Panasonic takes induction to the next level\", retrieved September 19, 2018</ref> three to five times higher than other cooktops,  to work with non-ferrous metal cookware.\n\n===Vendors===\n\nThe market for induction stoves is dominated by German manufacturers.\n\nSingle ring portable hobs have become popular in the UK, with prices as low as \u00a330 from discounters.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe European induction cooking market for hotels, restaurants and other caterers is primarily satisfied by smaller specialist commercial induction catering equipment manufacturers.\n\nTaiwanese and Japanese electronics companies are the dominant players in induction cooking for East Asia. After aggressive promotions by utilities in HK, many local brands emerged. Their power and ratings are high, more than 2,800 watts. Some of these companies have also started marketing in the West. However, the product range sold in Western markets is a subset of that in their domestic market; some Japanese electronics manufacturers only sell domestically.\n\nIn the United States, as of early 2013 there are over five dozen brands of induction-cooking equipment available, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment.  Even restricting to build-in residential-use units, there are over two dozen brands being sold; residential countertop units add another two-dozen-plus brands to the count.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders in 2012 estimated that, in the United States, induction cooktops held only 4% of sales, compared to gas and other electric cooktops.<ref>[http://www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=183725&fromGSA=1 ''Kitchen Appliance Upgrades that Shine'', retrieved 2012 Aug 15], nahb.org{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> The global induction cooktops market was estimated at $9.16 ml in value during 2015 and is set to grow to $13.53 mil by 2022.\n\nIn April 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that \"In an independent survey last summer by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. . . .

Webster argues that Freud became a kind of [[Messiah]] and that psychoanalysis is a [[pseudoscience]] and a disguised continuation of the [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]] tradition. Webster endorses [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s arguments against mentalist philosophies in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), and criticizes many other authors for their treatment of Freud and psychoanalysis.\n\nThe book for which Webster may be best remembered, it has been called \"brilliant\" and \"definitive\", but has also been criticized for shortcomings of scholarship and argument. It formed part of the \"Freud wars\", an ongoing controversy around psychoanalysis.\n\n==Summary==\nWebster argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience and a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition.{{sfn|Storr|1996|page=131}} He describes psychoanalysis as \"perhaps the most complex and successful\" pseudoscience in history,{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=12}} and Freud as an impostor who sought to found a false religion.{{sfn|Robertson|1999|page=xxx}} However, Webster also writes that, \"My ultimate goal is not to humiliate Freud or to inflict mortal injury either on him or his followers. It is to interpret and illuminate his beliefs and his personality in order that we may better understand our own culture, our own history, and indeed, our own psychology. It is to this ''constructive'' attempt to analyse the nature and sources of Freud's mistakes that my title primarily refers.\"{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=vii}} He discusses the influence on Freud of the otolaryngologist [[Wilhelm Fliess]] and the biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]].{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=223\u2013228, 231}}\n\nWebster writes that while [[Ernest Jones]] wrote ''[[The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud]]'' (1953-1957) with the avowed objective of correcting a \"mendacious legend\" about Freud, Jones replaced that negative with a positive legend. Webster maintains that Jones, \"did not hesitate to retouch reality wherever it seemed to conflict with the portrait which he sought to create.\"{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=14}} Webster argues that while [[Peter Gay]]'s ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988) is presented an objective exercise in historical scholarship, and considers the failings of psychoanalysis and Freud's mistakes, Gay nonetheless retains a reverent attitude toward Freud, preserving the myths about him created by previous biographers. Webster called these myths the \"Freud legend\". He suggests that the acclaim the book received shows the persistence of the Freud legend, noting that with exceptions such as [[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]], many reviewers praised it, especially in Britain. He saw its appeal to supporters of psychoanalysis as being its favorable view of Freudian ideas.{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=27\u201328}}\n\nHe endorses [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s arguments against mentalist philosophies in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), suggesting that they imply that \"theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature.\" Webster writes that the philosopher [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984) has been criticized by [[Frank Cioffi]], who rejects Gr\u00fcnbaum's portrayal of Freud as a philosophically astute investigator of human psychology. Webster argues that while the book contains much pertinent criticism of Freud, it has been overvalued by critics of psychoanalysis because of its overly theoretical and abstract style of argument, and has also distracted attention away from issues such as Freud's character. Webster compared the former psychoanalyst [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson]]'s ''[[The Assault on Truth]]'' (1984) to E. M. Thornton's ''[[The Freudian Fallacy]]'' (1983), finding both authors hostile towards Freud and psychoanalysis. However, he suggested that Masson nevertheless retained a partly positive view of Freud. Webster credited Masson with making some contributions to the history of psychoanalysis, but wrote that his central argument has not convinced either the psychoanalytic establishment or the majority of Freud's critics, as Masson accepted that Freud formulated the seduction theory on the basis of memories of childhood seduction provided by his patients, an account disputed by scholars such as Cioffi, Thornton, Han Isra\u00ebls, and Morton Schatzman, who have argued that Freud's original account of his therapeutic methods suggests that this is not what occurred. According to Webster, Freud's seduction theory maintained that episodes of childhood seduction would have a pathological effect only if the victim had no conscious recollection of them, and the purpose of his therapeutic sessions was not to listen to freely offered recollections but to encourage his patients to discover or construct scenes of which they had no recollection. Webster blamed Masson for encouraging the spread of the recovered memory movement by implying that most or all serious cases of neurosis are caused by child sexual abuse, that orthodox psychoanalysts were collectively engaged in a massive denial of this fact, and that an equally massive collective effort to retrieve painful memories of [[incest]] was required. Webster describes the critic [[Frederick Crews]]'s ''[[The Memory Wars]]'' (1995) as one of the most significant contributions to the debate on recovered memory therapy. Webster writes that the psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire]]'' (1985) contains many cogent criticisms of Freud, but criticizes Eysenck for uncritically accepting Elizabeth Thornton's argument that [[Joseph Breuer]]'s patient Anna O. suffered from tuberculous meningitis. Webster writes that some of [[Thomas Szasz]]'s arguments in ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]'' (1961) are similar to his, but that he disagrees with his view that hysteria was an emotional problem and that [[Jean-Martin Charcot]]'s patients were not genuinely mentally ill. Webster concludes that no \"negative critique\" of psychoanalysis \"can ever constitute an adequate refutation\" of Freud's theories, because \"bad theories can only be driven out by better theories.\"{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=22\u201324, 201\u2013202, 455, 483, 519, 528, 560, 577\u201378, 595\u2013597}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\n''Why Freud Was Wrong'' was first published in 1995 by HarperCollins. In 1996, an edition with an added preface was published. In 2005, an edition with a new postscript was published by The Orwell Press.{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=i, xi, xvii}} The work has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Hungarian.{{sfn|Webster|2011}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Media commentary===\n''Why Freud Was Wrong'' received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',{{sfn|Stuttaford|1995|page=66}} the psychiatrist [[E.

He suggested that Webster was well suited to the task of discussing the Christian roots of Freud's ideas and credited him with providing a detailed discussion of Freud's character that revealed its \"unpleasant traits\", though he considered his comment that Freud had a \"sometimes less than scrupulous attitude toward truth\" as an understatement. He found his discussion of the recovered memory movement one of the most interesting sections of the book. However, he criticized him for not providing more discussion of the cultural influence of Freudian theories, for failing to address \"Freud's misogynistic teachings\" and their effects on the women's movement, and for providing insufficient information about Freud's use of cocaine.{{sfn|Torrey|1995|pages=43\u201344}}\n\nLodge considered the book \"exceptionally searching, lucid, and well-argued\", as well as \"intellectually exciting\" and \"challenging\", and noted that it was \"linked to an ambitious project for a true science of human nature\". He wrote that it was impossible to read it \"without having one's respect for Freud shaken and diminished\". However, he added that it was possible to \"learn from it without accepting Webster's thesis that Freud's ideas were totally worthless.\" He accepted Webster's argument that the growth of the psychoanalytic movement corresponds closely to the historical development of religions, but wrote that this does not necessarily discredit psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Lodge|1996|page=20}}\n\nTwiggs described the book as readable, and wrote that it presented an effective argument and rivaled the psychiatrist [[Henri Ellenberger]]'s ''[[The Discovery of the Unconscious]]'' (1970). However, he criticized Webster for failing to address the point that psychoanalysis added a \"critical dimension to a growing theory of human behavior and spirituality\".{{sfn|Twiggs|1995|page=100}}\n\nMcLynn described the work as \"the oddest book to come my way in years\". He wrote that Webster made \"the most savage attack ever mounted on Freud and psychoanalysis\", and offered a confused and eclectic attempt to develop a general theory of human nature. In his view, the book failed to live up to the \"grandiose claims\" made by its publishers. He criticized Webster for maintaining that mental illness is misdiagnosed organic disease, for criticizing physicians and psychiatrists despite his lack of medical qualifications, for offering conjectural explanations of cases of hysteria and schizophrenia, for unreasonably insisting \"that Freud should have acquainted us ... with every stage in his work with patients\", and for misunderstanding psychoanalysis. He found Webster's criticisms of concepts such as \"unconscious rage\" unconvincing, accused him of \"internal inconsistencies\", and wrote that he \"has a disconcerting habit of citing anti-Freudian authorities to bolster an argument and then rounding on them to claim that the rest of their anti-Freudian argument is false.\"{{sfn|McLynn|1995|page=31}}\n\nWoffinden suggested that ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' may be the book for which Webster is best remembered.{{sfn|Woffinden|2011}}\n\n===Reviews in scientific and academic journals===\n''Why Freud Was Wrong'' received a positive review in the ''[[Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences]]'',{{sfn|''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''|1997|page=438}} a mixed review from Peter Swales in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',{{sfn|Swales|1995|pages=105\u2013108}} and a negative review from Hannah S. Decker in ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''.{{sfn|Decker|2000|pages=175\u2013177}} The book was also reviewed by John S. Callender in ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'',{{sfn|Callender|1996|page=518}} the psychoanalyst John Lawrence in the ''Journal of Social Work Practice'',{{sfn|Lawrence|1997|pages=51\u201353}} and the evolutionary biologist [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''.{{sfn|Williams|1998|pages=59\u201360}}\n\nThe ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' described the book as a \"a valuable contribution\" to understanding Freud and credited Webster with \"a thorough study of Freud\u2019s life and works as well as of secondary sources\".{{sfn|''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''|1997|page=438}}\n\nSwales wrote that while the book was advertised on its jacket as a comprehensive biography, Webster did not expand \"factual knowledge of Freud's life and work\", but rather engaged in a \"relentless polemic\" that was \"flawed in its simplifications\" but \"lethal in its total impact.\" He considered the book an important contribution despite being largely derivative. He considered Webster's evaluation of Freud as a person \"provocative though tenable\". He noted that Webster, despite not having a background in medicine, argued that Breuer's patient [[Anna O.]] suffered from \"a severe neurological disorder\" and that \"its array of florid symptoms underwent spontaneous remission one after another.\" He credited Webster with exposing many \"empirical and logical\" absurdities in Freud's views, and making a generally strong case against Freud. However, he was less convinced by Webster's attempt to minimize Freud's originality, finding it \"wearisome\". He argued that Webster lacked familiarity with the history of ideas in 19th-century Germany and Austria and was too \"Anglo-centric\" in his approach, and criticized him for devoting only half a page to Freud's most intellectually formative years, and ignoring published letters by Freud written during that period. He considered Webster, following [[Frank Sulloway]], correct to emphasize that the development of Freud's theories after 1896 was mainly inspired by assumptions drawn from contemporary biology. However, he maintained that Webster was \"oblivious to Freud's background in biology\" and wrongly concluded that it was Fliess, rather than Haeckel, who led Freud to accept the view that [[ontogeny]] recapitulates [[phylogeny]]. He criticized Webster for failing to consider sources of Freudian theory such as [[Thomas Carlyle]]. He considered Webster's efforts to create a \"new psychology\", based on neo-Darwinism, unconvincing and wrote that Webster failed to explain what it would consist of.{{sfn|Swales|1995|pages=105\u2013108}}\n\nDecker wrote that Webster showed \"a commendable command of the secondary literature\", but described his book as \"a work of total nihilism\" and wrote that it contained \"many factual errors\" and was difficult to take seriously. Decker accepted that some of Webster's objections to Freud \"had some substance\", but in her view he destroyed the validity of these points by taking them to extremes.

Webster argues that Freud became a kind of [[Messiah]] and that psychoanalysis is a [[pseudoscience]] and a disguised continuation of the [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]] tradition. Webster endorses [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s arguments against mentalist philosophies in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), and criticizes many other authors for their treatment of Freud and psychoanalysis.\n\nThe book for which Webster may be best remembered, it has been called \"brilliant\" and \"definitive\", but has also been criticized for shortcomings of scholarship and argument. It formed part of the \"Freud wars\", an ongoing controversy around psychoanalysis.\n\n==Summary==\nWebster argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience and a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition.{{sfn|Storr|1996|page=131}} He describes psychoanalysis as \"perhaps the most complex and successful\" pseudoscience in history,{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=12}} and Freud as an impostor who sought to found a false religion.{{sfn|Robertson|1999|page=xxx}} However, Webster also writes that, \"My ultimate goal is not to humiliate Freud or to inflict mortal injury either on him or his followers. It is to interpret and illuminate his beliefs and his personality in order that we may better understand our own culture, our own history, and indeed, our own psychology. It is to this ''constructive'' attempt to analyse the nature and sources of Freud's mistakes that my title primarily refers.\"{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=vii}} He discusses the influence on Freud of the otolaryngologist [[Wilhelm Fliess]] and the biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]].{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=223\u2013228, 231}}\n\nWebster writes that while [[Ernest Jones]] wrote ''[[The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud]]'' (1953-1957) with the avowed objective of correcting a \"mendacious legend\" about Freud, Jones replaced that negative with a positive legend. Webster maintains that Jones, \"did not hesitate to retouch reality wherever it seemed to conflict with the portrait which he sought to create.\"{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=14}} Webster argues that while [[Peter Gay]]'s ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988) is presented an objective exercise in historical scholarship, and considers the failings of psychoanalysis and Freud's mistakes, Gay nonetheless retains a reverent attitude toward Freud, preserving the myths about him created by previous biographers. Webster called these myths the \"Freud legend\". He suggests that the acclaim the book received shows the persistence of the Freud legend, noting that with exceptions such as [[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]], many reviewers praised it, especially in Britain. He saw its appeal to supporters of psychoanalysis as being its favorable view of Freudian ideas.{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=27\u201328}}\n\nHe endorses [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s arguments against mentalist philosophies in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), suggesting that they imply that \"theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature.\" Webster writes that the philosopher [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984) has been criticized by [[Frank Cioffi]], who rejects Gr\u00fcnbaum's portrayal of Freud as a philosophically astute investigator of human psychology. Webster argues that while the book contains much pertinent criticism of Freud, it has been overvalued by critics of psychoanalysis because of its overly theoretical and abstract style of argument, and has also distracted attention away from issues such as Freud's character. Webster compared the former psychoanalyst [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson]]'s ''[[The Assault on Truth]]'' (1984) to E. M. Thornton's ''[[The Freudian Fallacy]]'' (1983), finding both authors hostile towards Freud and psychoanalysis. However, he suggested that Masson nevertheless retained a partly positive view of Freud. Webster credited Masson with making some contributions to the history of psychoanalysis, but wrote that his central argument has not convinced either the psychoanalytic establishment or the majority of Freud's critics, as Masson accepted that Freud formulated the seduction theory on the basis of memories of childhood seduction provided by his patients, an account disputed by scholars such as Cioffi, Thornton, Han Isra\u00ebls, and Morton Schatzman, who have argued that Freud's original account of his therapeutic methods suggests that this is not what occurred. According to Webster, Freud's seduction theory maintained that episodes of childhood seduction would have a pathological effect only if the victim had no conscious recollection of them, and the purpose of his therapeutic sessions was not to listen to freely offered recollections but to encourage his patients to discover or construct scenes of which they had no recollection. Webster blamed Masson for encouraging the spread of the recovered memory movement by implying that most or all serious cases of neurosis are caused by child sexual abuse, that orthodox psychoanalysts were collectively engaged in a massive denial of this fact, and that an equally massive collective effort to retrieve painful memories of [[incest]] was required. Webster describes the critic [[Frederick Crews]]'s ''[[The Memory Wars]]'' (1995) as one of the most significant contributions to the debate on recovered memory therapy. Webster writes that the psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire]]'' (1985) contains many cogent criticisms of Freud, but criticizes Eysenck for uncritically accepting Elizabeth Thornton's argument that [[Joseph Breuer]]'s patient Anna O. suffered from tuberculous meningitis. Webster writes that some of [[Thomas Szasz]]'s arguments in ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]'' (1961) are similar to his, but that he disagrees with his view that hysteria was an emotional problem and that [[Jean-Martin Charcot]]'s patients were not genuinely mentally ill. Webster concludes that no \"negative critique\" of psychoanalysis \"can ever constitute an adequate refutation\" of Freud's theories, because \"bad theories can only be driven out by better theories.\"{{sfn|Webster|2005|pages=22\u201324, 201\u2013202, 455, 483, 519, 528, 560, 577\u201378, 595\u2013597}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\n''Why Freud Was Wrong'' was first published in 1995 by HarperCollins.

He suggested that Webster was well suited to the task of discussing the Christian roots of Freud's ideas and credited him with providing a detailed discussion of Freud's character that revealed its \"unpleasant traits\", though he considered his comment that Freud had a \"sometimes less than scrupulous attitude toward truth\" as an understatement. He found his discussion of the recovered memory movement one of the most interesting sections of the book. However, he criticized him for not providing more discussion of the cultural influence of Freudian theories, for failing to address \"Freud's misogynistic teachings\" and their effects on the women's movement, and for providing insufficient information about Freud's use of cocaine.{{sfn|Torrey|1995|pages=43\u201344}}\n\nLodge considered the book \"exceptionally searching, lucid, and well-argued\", as well as \"intellectually exciting\" and \"challenging\", and noted that it was \"linked to an ambitious project for a true science of human nature\". He wrote that it was impossible to read it \"without having one's respect for Freud shaken and diminished\". However, he added that it was possible to \"learn from it without accepting Webster's thesis that Freud's ideas were totally worthless.\" He accepted Webster's argument that the growth of the psychoanalytic movement corresponds closely to the historical development of religions, but wrote that this does not necessarily discredit psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Lodge|1996|page=20}}\n\nTwiggs described the book as readable, and wrote that it presented an effective argument and rivaled the psychiatrist [[Henri Ellenberger]]'s ''[[The Discovery of the Unconscious]]'' (1970). However, he criticized Webster for failing to address the point that psychoanalysis added a \"critical dimension to a growing theory of human behavior and spirituality\".{{sfn|Twiggs|1995|page=100}}\n\nMcLynn described the work as \"the oddest book to come my way in years\". He wrote that Webster made \"the most savage attack ever mounted on Freud and psychoanalysis\", and offered a confused and eclectic attempt to develop a general theory of human nature. In his view, the book failed to live up to the \"grandiose claims\" made by its publishers. He criticized Webster for maintaining that mental illness is misdiagnosed organic disease, for criticizing physicians and psychiatrists despite his lack of medical qualifications, for offering conjectural explanations of cases of hysteria and schizophrenia, for unreasonably insisting \"that Freud should have acquainted us ... with every stage in his work with patients\", and for misunderstanding psychoanalysis. He found Webster's criticisms of concepts such as \"unconscious rage\" unconvincing, accused him of \"internal inconsistencies\", and wrote that he \"has a disconcerting habit of citing anti-Freudian authorities to bolster an argument and then rounding on them to claim that the rest of their anti-Freudian argument is false.\"{{sfn|McLynn|1995|page=31}}\n\nWoffinden suggested that ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' may be the book for which Webster is best remembered.{{sfn|Woffinden|2011}}\n\n===Reviews in scientific and academic journals===\n''Why Freud Was Wrong'' received a positive review in the ''[[Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences]]'',{{sfn|''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''|1997|page=438}} a mixed review from Peter Swales in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',{{sfn|Swales|1995|pages=105\u2013108}} and a negative review from Hannah S. Decker in ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''.{{sfn|Decker|2000|pages=175\u2013177}} The book was also reviewed by John S.

Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''.{{sfn|Williams|1998|pages=59\u201360}}\n\nThe ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' described the book as a \"a valuable contribution\" to understanding Freud and credited Webster with \"a thorough study of Freud\u2019s life and works as well as of secondary sources\".{{sfn|''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''|1997|page=438}}\n\nSwales wrote that while the book was advertised on its jacket as a comprehensive biography, Webster did not expand \"factual knowledge of Freud's life and work\", but rather engaged in a \"relentless polemic\" that was \"flawed in its simplifications\" but \"lethal in its total impact.\" He considered the book an important contribution despite being largely derivative. He considered Webster's evaluation of Freud as a person \"provocative though tenable\". He noted that Webster, despite not having a background in medicine, argued that Breuer's patient [[Anna O.]] suffered from \"a severe neurological disorder\" and that \"its array of florid symptoms underwent spontaneous remission one after another.\" He credited Webster with exposing many \"empirical and logical\" absurdities in Freud's views, and making a generally strong case against Freud. However, he was less convinced by Webster's attempt to minimize Freud's originality, finding it \"wearisome\". He argued that Webster lacked familiarity with the history of ideas in 19th-century Germany and Austria and was too \"Anglo-centric\" in his approach, and criticized him for devoting only half a page to Freud's most intellectually formative years, and ignoring published letters by Freud written during that period. He considered Webster, following [[Frank Sulloway]], correct to emphasize that the development of Freud's theories after 1896 was mainly inspired by assumptions drawn from contemporary biology. However, he maintained that Webster was \"oblivious to Freud's background in biology\" and wrongly concluded that it was Fliess, rather than Haeckel, who led Freud to accept the view that [[ontogeny]] recapitulates [[phylogeny]]. He criticized Webster for failing to consider sources of Freudian theory such as [[Thomas Carlyle]]. He considered Webster's efforts to create a \"new psychology\", based on neo-Darwinism, unconvincing and wrote that Webster failed to explain what it would consist of.{{sfn|Swales|1995|pages=105\u2013108}}\n\nDecker wrote that Webster showed \"a commendable command of the secondary literature\", but described his book as \"a work of total nihilism\" and wrote that it contained \"many factual errors\" and was difficult to take seriously. Decker accepted that some of Webster's objections to Freud \"had some substance\", but in her view he destroyed the validity of these points by taking them to extremes. She gave as an example the way Webster moved from correctly noting that Freud \"did hound some of his patients to give him the evidence he was looking for\", to incorrectly concluding that all of his patients' accounts of seductions and fantasies were Freud's reconstructions, thereby undermining a sound observation. She agreed with Webster that not all dreams are wish fulfillments, but criticized him for not acknowledging that psychoanalysts have long abandoned the belief that they are. She considered Webster naive or ignorant to deny that \"emotions can produce bodily phenomena\", and criticized his discussion of Breuer's treatment of his patient Anna O.{{sfn|Decker|2000|pages=175\u2013177}}\n\n===Other evaluations===\n''Why Freud Was Wrong'' was described as \"brilliant\" by the psychiatrist [[Anthony Storr]] and the biographer [[Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy]],{{sfn|Storr|1996|page=131}}{{sfn|Gathorne-Hardy|2005|page=92}} and \"definitive\" by the philosopher [[Raymond Tallis]],{{sfn|Tallis|1999|page=457}} but was criticized for shortcomings of scholarship and argument by the critic [[Elaine Showalter]].{{sfn|Showalter|1997|pages=41, 45}} In a preface to the 1998 edition of ''[[The Assault on Truth]]'', first published in 1984, Masson wrote that ''Why Freud Was Wrong'' had received acclaim. However, he criticized Webster for blaming him for the current interest in recovered memories, writing that his interest in writing ''The Assault on Truth'' had nothing to do with the recovery of memories, and that he did not discuss the topic in any depth. Masson argued that Webster was incorrect to claim that there is no evidence that any of Freud's patients had been sexually abused.

On 11 September 1827 the Irish actress [[Harriet Smithson]] played the part of Ophelia in ''Hamlet''.<ref name=Cairns1969p70>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], p. 70.</ref>\n[[File:Harriet Smithson as Ophelia 1827 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Harriet Smithson as Ophelia (1827)]]\nHer mad scene appeared to owe little to tradition and seemed almost like an improvisation, with several contemporary accounts remarking on her astonishing capacity for mime. Her performances produced an extraordinary reaction: men wept openly in the theater, and when they left were \"convulsed by uncontrollable emotion.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p619>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], pp. 619&ndash;620.</ref> The twenty-five-year-old [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], who was about to embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, \"far surpassing all my expectations\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 247.</ref> The French composer [[Hector Berlioz]] was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: \"The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before me at a stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths. I recognized the meaning of dramatic grandeur, beauty, truth.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p70/> Even the wife of the [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|English ambassador]], Lady Granville, felt compelled to report that the Parisians \"roar over Miss Smithson's Ophelia, and strange to say so did I\".<ref>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 248.</ref> (The actress's Irish accent and the lack of power in her voice had hindered her success in London.)<ref name=Cairns1969p619/> It wasn't long before new clothing and hair styles, ''\u00e0 la mode d'Oph\u00e9lie'' and modeled on those of the actress, became all the rage in Paris.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nNot everything about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found by many to be laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal ''Pandore'' wrote about \"that English candour which allows everything to be expressed and everything to be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/> Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him \"what I was searching for, what I lacked, what I had to find &ndash; actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/>\n\nThe composer Berlioz was soon totally infatuated with Miss Smithson. His love for her, initially unrequited, became an obsession and served as inspiration for his music. His ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (''Fantastic Symphony'', 1830) portrays an opium-induced vision in which the musician's beloved appears as a recurrent musical motif, the ''id\u00e9e fixe'', which like any obsession \"finds its way into every incredible situation [movement]\".<ref>Milder, John (1963).

Besides in music, it also manifested itself in art. [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]'s relief ''Oph\u00e9lie'' (1844) depicted a young woman wading into water with her hair let down and swirling in the current.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n===French versions of the play===\n[[File:DUMAS PERE.jpg|thumb|Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]\nBy the early 1840s [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], who had become a personal friend of Berlioz and Smithson,<ref>[[#Barzun|Barzun, Jacques (1969)]], '''1''': 277, 315.</ref> had achieved international fame with his historical novels and dramas. With the heightened interest in Shakespeare, and in particular ''Hamlet'', that had been aroused by Smithson's performances at the Od\u00e9on, he decided to prepare a new French translation of the play to be presented at his [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]]. An earlier verse translation of ''Hamlet'' into French by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ducis]], first performed in 1769, was still being given at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and Dumas knew the leading role by heart. The Ducis play bore very little resemblance to the Shakespeare original. There were far fewer characters: no ghost, no Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, no players, no gravediggers. There was no duel, and Hamlet did not die at the end. Modifications such as these were necessary to gain performances in the French theaters of his time. Ducis had told the English actor-impresario [[David Garrick]] that a ghost which speaks, itinerant players, and a fencing duel were \"absolutely inadmissible\" on the French stage.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 97.</ref> Dumas realized that Ducis' play was not the same as the original: Pierre Le Tourneur had published a relatively faithful prose translation, not intended for performance, in 1779. Nevertheless, moral propriety and ''politesse'' dictated that only such highly sanitized versions as that of Ducis could be performed on stage. The French referred to these performing editions as ''imitations'', and most knew that they were highly modified versions of the original. All the same, Ducis was at first accused of polluting French theaters with Shakespeare; only much later was he indicted for mutilating the original.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 98.</ref>\n\nDumas could not speak or read English well. He needed help, so he selected a younger writer by the name of [[Paul Meurice]] from among his coterie of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and assistants. Meurice had earlier collaborated with [[Auguste Vacquerie]] on ''Falstaff'', a combination of [[Henry IV, Part 1|Parts I]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|II of Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'']], which had been presented at the Od\u00e9on in 1842. The Dumas-Meurice ''Hamlet'' was performed at Dumas' Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique in 1847 and had an enormous success. (With some alterations the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise took it into repertory in 1886, and it continued to be performed in France until the middle of the 20th century.)<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe Dumas-Meurice version was more faithful to Shakespeare and restored much of what was missing from the Ducis version, including Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the ghost, the duel, and the gravediggers. Still, by modern standards, it was a rather free adaptation of the original. Fortinbras was dropped, and the entire opening scene with the sentinels on the ramparts of the castle was excised. A love scene between Hamlet and Ophelia was added to the first act. Claudius does not send Hamlet to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do not die. Notably, at the end of the play, as Gertrude, Claudius, and Laertes are dying, the ghost of Hamlet's father reappears and condemns each of the dying characters. To Claudius it says: ''D\u00e9sesp\u00e8re et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Despair and die!\"; to Laertes: ''Prie et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Pray and die!\"; and to the Queen: ''Esp\u00e8re et meure!'' &ndash; \"Hope and die!\". When the wounded Hamlet asks: ''Et quel ch\u00e2timent m'attend donc?'' &ndash; \"And what punishment awaits me?\", the ghost responds: ''Tu vivras!'' &ndash; \"You shall live!\", and the curtain falls.<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], pp. 109\u2013111.</ref>\n\nDumas explained these \"improvements\" to Shakespeare's play by insisting that the original violated plausibility, transgressed decency, and destroyed the dramatic balance. \"Since Hamlet is not guilty to the same degree as the others, he should not die the same death as the others.\" Four dead bodies would constitute \"the most unpleasant effect.\" Since the ghost appears at the beginning of the play, \"it must necessarily reappear to be present at the end.\"<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 111.</ref>\n\n==Preparation of the libretto==\nThe librettists for the opera of ''Hamlet'', Michel Carr\u00e9 and Jules Barbier, were experienced: they had already provided librettos for Thomas' ''Mignon'' and also for Gounod's ''Faust''.<ref name=Forbes21>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 21.</ref> They chose Dumas' version of the play as the basis for their libretto. This was the version with which French audiences of the day were most familiar, and the one against which the opera would be compared and judged.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nWhen adapting a play for opera, it was imperative to shorten and simplify. Traditionally [[grand opera]] conveys plot in broad brushstrokes; the audience is not particularly interested in its intricacies, or its detours and complexities.<ref>White, Nicholas (2003). \"Fictions and librettos\" in Charlton, David, ed. ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Grand Opera]]'', p. 45. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-64683-3}}.</ref> An uncut version of Shakespeare's play had more than 30 characters and could run for over four hours. The libretto reduced the total number of characters to fifteen (counting the four mime players required for the Play scene), and also reduced the number of subplots. Dumas had cut the scene with the sentinels Bernardo and Francisco. Gone also were Voltimand, Cornelius, Osric, and Reynaldo. Like Dumas, Fortinbras was omitted, thus there was no need to mention an invasion from Norway. Dumas omitted the subplot of Hamlet's voyage to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were also omitted, removing most of the black humor of the play. Polonius' accidental murder in act 4 was excised, and his singing part reduced to only eight measures.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes21/><ref name=Salter>Salter, Lionel (1994). [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/January%201994/99 Review of the recording of ''Hamlet'' with Thomas Hampson]. ''Gramophone'', January 1994.</ref>\n\nThis simplification of characters and subplots focused the drama on Hamlet's predicament and its effects on Oph\u00e9lie and left the opera with essentially 4 main characters: Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie, Claudius and Gertrude. This constellation of roles preserved the tetradic model and the balance of male and female parts which had become established in French grand opera at the time of Meyerbeer's ''[[Robert le diable]]'' in 1831. The libretto originally specified for these roles one soprano (Oph\u00e9lie), one mezzo-soprano (Gertrude), one tenor (Hamlet), and one baritone or bass (Claudius).<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nOther plot changes, such as making L\u00e4erte less cynical and more positive towards Hamlet early on,<ref name=Gurewitsch/> not only simplified the story but heightened the tragedy of their duel in the Gravediggers Scene. Making Gertrude a co-conspirator alongside Claudius, enhanced the dramatic conflict between Hamlet and Gertrude when Hamlet attempts to coerce a confession from her in the Closet Scene. Making Polonius a co-conspirator, as revealed in the Closet Scene, strengthened Hamlet's motivation in rejecting his marriage to Oph\u00e9lie. This crucial change facilitated the transformation of Shakespeare's Ophelia into the opera's Oph\u00e9lie, a creature who dramatically is almost entirely drawn from the 19th-century, whose madness stems not from the actions of a man who creates an intolerable situation, but rather from a man whose withdrawal leaves an emptiness she is unable to fill. Musically, of course, the Mad Scene was one of those audience-pleasing creations which drew upon well-established operatic tradition.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes24>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 24.</ref>\n\nAnother change, the addition of Hamlet's drinking song for the Players in act 2, created another opportunity for an audience-pleasing musical number. It also led to a shortening of his instructions to them before the song<ref name=Forbes21/> and could be justified dramatically as a cover for his ulterior motive in asking them to enact the mime play.<ref name=Tubeuf/> In the final scene, in another simplification of the plot, La\u00ebrte, Polonius, and Gertrude survive. As in the Dumas' play, the ghost returns at the end, but unlike in Dumas, the ghost merely banishes Gertrude to a convent for her role in the conspiracy. Finally, exactly as in Dumas, Hamlet lives and is proclaimed King.<ref name=Tubeuf>[[Andr\u00e9 Tubeuf|Tubeuf, Andr\u00e9]]; Corbier, Annie, trans. \"Synopsis\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 30&ndash;32.</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Hamlet (opera) by Thomas, Cover of Piano-Vocal Score.jpg|thumb|Cover of the piano-vocal score of Thomas' ''Hamlet'' (1868)]]\nVery little is known concerning the details of the composition of the music. Thomas may have received the libretto around 1859. The original libretto was in four acts, but the requirements of the authorities at that time specified the premiere at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] of at least one 5-act opera per season.<ref name=Fauser/> The inclusion of a ballet was also obligatory.<ref name=Forbes611/> The fourth and final act, which included the Mad Scene and the Gravediggers Scene, was simply split into two. To confer more weight to the new fourth act, the ballet was added between the choral introduction of the Mad Scene and Oph\u00e9lie's recitative and aria.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nIn 1863 the director of the Op\u00e9ra, [[\u00c9mile Perrin]], wrote in a letter to a minister of state that Thomas had nearly finished writing the music. Later the press conjectured as to the reason for the delay of the opera, suggesting that Thomas had yet to find his ideal Oph\u00e9lie.<ref name=Fauser/> Thomas' opera ''[[Mignon]]'' (1866), an adaptation of Goethe's novel ''[[Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]'', had been the composer's very effective response to Gounod's earlier Goethe adaption, the opera [[Faust (opera)|''Faust'']], which had premiered in 1859. ''Mignon'' had been performed at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]], and Thomas was under pressure to provide a similar success at the Op\u00e9ra, in particular as several of his earlier productions there had done poorly.<ref name=Forbes726>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Thomas, (Charles Louis) Ambroise\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''4''': 726-727.</ref>\n\nWhen Gounod's Shakespeare adaptation, the opera ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', appeared at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] in 1867, it provided additional impetus for Thomas to finish working on his own adaptation of ''Hamlet''.<ref>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 20&ndash;21.</ref> According to accounts in the press, it was that same year, at his publisher [[Heugel (music publisher)|Heugel]]'s office in Paris, that Thomas met the Swedish soprano [[Christine Nilsson]], who had just been engaged at the Op\u00e9ra. Thomas finally consented to the scheduling of the premiere. Consistent with this press report, parts of the soprano role were altered around this time with Nilsson's capabilities in mind. Thomas replaced a dialog with the women's chorus in the Mad Scene in act 4 with a Swedish Ballade.<ref name=Fauser/> The ballad is [[Neck_(water_spirit)|Neck\u2019s]] Polska, \"Deep in the sea\u201d (in Swedish N\u00e4ckens Polska, \u201cDjupt i hafvet\u201d) with lyrics by [[Arvid August Afzelius]]. The tune is a traditional Swedish folk tune. The ballad is well known in all the Nordic countries, and is also used the first Danish national play [[Elves' Hill]], Deep in the sea (in Danish Elverh\u00f8j  \u201cDybt i havet\u201d).\nIts use was suggested to Thomas by Nilsson.\n\n\nA tenor suitable for the role of Hamlet could not be found, but an outstanding dramatic baritone, [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], was available, so Thomas decided to transpose the part, originally written for a tenor, to baritone. In the event, Faure \"achieved a tremendous personal triumph as Hamlet.\"<ref name=Forbes726/>\n\n\n==Performance history==\nThe work was premiered at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] ([[Salle Le Peletier]]) on 9 March 1868.

Claudius places the crown on Gertrude's head. All leave, and Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters. He is upset that his mother has remarried so soon. Oph\u00e9lie enters, and they sing a love duet. La\u00ebrte, Oph\u00e9lie's brother, enters. He is being sent to Norway and gives his farewells. He entrusts Oph\u00e9lie to the care of Hamlet. Hamlet refuses to join La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie as they leave to join the banquet, and goes off in another direction. Courtiers and soldiers, on their way to the banquet, enter the hall. Horatio and Marcellus tell the soldiers that they have seen the ghost of Hamlet's father on the ramparts of the castle the previous night and go off to tell Hamlet.\n\n''Scene 2: The Ramparts''\n\nHoratio and Marcellus meet Hamlet on the ramparts. The Ghost appears, Horatio and Marcellus leave, and the Ghost tells his son that Claudius murdered him with poison. The Ghost commands Hamlet to take vengeance on Claudius, but Gertrude must be spared. The Ghost withdraws. Hamlet draws his sword and swears to avenge his father.\n\n[[File:Christine Nilsson as Ophelia NGO2-607.jpg|thumb|[[Christina Nilsson|Christine Nilsson]] as Oph\u00e9lie]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: The Gardens''\n\nOph\u00e9lie, reading a book, is concerned at Hamlet's new indifference. Hamlet appears in the distance, but leaves without speaking. The Queen enters. Oph\u00e9lie says she would like to leave the court, but the Queen insists she should stay. Oph\u00e9lie leaves the garden and King Claudius enters. Gertrude suspects that Hamlet now knows about the murder of his father, but Claudius says he does not. Hamlet enters and feigns madness. He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'' and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\n''Scene 2: The Play''\n\nThe King and Queen and the other guests assemble in the castle hall where the stage has been set up. The play begins, and Hamlet narrates. The play tells a story similar to the murder of Hamlet's father. After the \"poison\" is administered, the \"assassin\" places the \"crown\" on his head. Claudius turns pale, rises abruptly, and commands the play to stop and the actors to leave. Hamlet accuses Claudius of the murder of his father, and snatches Claudius' crown from his head. The entire assembly reacts in a grand septet with chorus.\n\n===Act 3===\n''Closet Scene''\n\nIn the Queen's chambers Hamlet delivers the monologue \"To be or not to be\", then hides behind a tapestry. Claudius enters and prays aloud of his remorse. Hamlet, deciding Claudius' soul may be saved, if he is killed while praying, delays yet again. Polonius enters and in his conversation with Claudius reveals his own complicity. The King and Polonius leave, Hamlet emerges, and Gertrude enters with Oph\u00e9lie. The Queen tries to persuade Hamlet to marry Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet, realizing he can no longer marry the daughter of the guilty Polonius, refuses. Oph\u00e9lie returns her ring to Hamlet and leaves. Hamlet tries to force Gertrude to confront her guilt, but she resists. As Hamlet threatens her, he sees the Ghost, who reminds him he must spare his mother.\n\n===Act 4===\n''The Mad Scene''\n\nAfter Hamlet's rejection, Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad and drowns herself in the lake.\n\n===Act 5===\n''Gravediggers Scene''\n\nHamlet comes upon two gravediggers digging a new grave. He asks who has died, but they do not know. He sings of remorse for his ill treatment of Oph\u00e9lie. La\u00ebrte, who has returned from Norway and learned of his sister's death and Hamlet's role in it, enters and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded, but Oph\u00e9lie's funeral procession interrupts the duel. Hamlet finally realizes she is dead. The Ghost appears again and exhorts Hamlet to kill Claudius, which Hamlet does, avenging his father's death. The Ghost affirms Claudius' guilt and Hamlet's innocence. Hamlet, still in despair, is proclaimed King to cries of \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\".\n\n:[In the much shorter \"Covent Garden\" ending the ghost does not appear, and, after Hamlet finally attacks and kills Claudius, he embraces Oph\u00e9lie's body and dies.

The opera begins with a brief prelude approximately three and a half minutes in length.

Introduction, march and chorus.''' The court celebrates the Coronation of Gertrude, widow of King Hamlet; and her marriage to his brother, Claudius (Courtiers: ''Que nos chants montent jusqu'aux cieux'' &ndash; \"Let our songs rise to the skies\"). The new king, Claudius, stands before his throne on a dais, surrounded by the nobles of the court. His court chancellor, Polonius, is nearby. Queen Gertrude enters, approaches the dais, and bows to the King (Courtiers: ''Salut, \u00f4 Reine bien-aim\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Greetings, O beloved Queen!\"). Polonius hands the King a crown, which he takes and places on her head (The King: ''\u00d4 toi, qui fus la femme de mon fr\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"O you who were my brother's wife\"). Gertrude comments in an [[aside]] to Claudius that she does not see her son Hamlet. Claudius admonishes her to bear herself as a queen. The courtiers sing of their joy as they celebrate the King and Queen's glorious marriage (Courtiers: ''Le deuil fait place aux chants joyeux'' &ndash; \"Mourning gives way to joyful songs\"). The King and Queen leave the hall followed by the courtiers.\n\n'''2. Recitative and duet.''' Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters the empty hall. As Hamlet enters, before he begins singing, the low strings in the orchestra play '''Hamlet's Theme''':<ref name=\"Fauser\"/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Hamlet's Theme - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p24).jpg|thumb|500px|Hamlet's Theme from act 1.

Tendresse \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Futile regrets! Ephemeral tenderness!\").\n\nOph\u00e9lie enters. Her entrance is accompanied by '''Oph\u00e9lie's Theme'''. According to the German musicologist Annegret Fauser, Oph\u00e9lie's music contrasts with Hamlet's very regular 8-bar phrase: the 4-bar theme accentuates her nervous character by the use of dotted-note rhythms, a chromatic melody line, and high-range woodwind instruments. The excerpt below ends with 3 bars of florid solo flute music which foreshadows Oph\u00e9lie's [[coloratura]] singing later in the opera.<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Ophelia's Theme - Hamlet - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score pp26-27).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Oph\u00e9lie's Theme from act 1 (first 4 bars).

Hamlet protests he cannot make promises of love one day, only to forget them the next. His heart is not that of a woman. Oph\u00e9lie is distraught at the insult, and Hamlet begs forgiveness.\n\nThe '''duet''' affirms their love (Hamlet, Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"Doubt that the light\"). The text of the duet is based on Shakespeare's \"Doubt thou the stars are fire\", which is part of a letter from Hamlet to Ophelia which Polonius reads to Gertrude and Claudius. The melody of the vocal line in Hamlet's first phrases has been called the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love for Oph\u00e9lie''' and appears several more times in the opera, with particular poignancy near the end of the Mad Scene (see [[#Mad Scene|below]]).<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p30).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia from act 1.

They reoccur, usually in modified form, whenever significant situations relevant to the ideas they represent present themselves, although without having, in the Wagnerian sense, a [[leitmotiv]]ic function.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n'''3. Recitative and cavatina of La\u00ebrte.''' Oph\u00e9lie's brother, La\u00ebrte, enters. He tells Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie that the King is sending him to the court of Norway, and he must leave that very night (unlike in the play where, as Matthew Gurewitsch of ''[[Opera News]]'' has said, he embarks for \"the fleshpots of Paris\").<ref name=Gurewitsch>Gurewitsch, Matthew (March 2010).

Subscription required.</ref> In his cavatina, La\u00ebrte asks Hamlet to watch over his sister while he is gone (La\u00ebrte: ''Pour mon pays, en serviteur fid\u00e8le'' &ndash; \"For my country, in faithful service\"). (In the play Laertes warns Ophelia to be wary of Hamlet's intentions.) Fanfares are heard as servants and pages pass at the back. La\u00ebrte asks Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie to come with him to the banquet, but Hamlet declines. The couple separates, as La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie leave for the banquet, and Hamlet goes off in the other direction. More fanfares are heard as lords and ladies enter on their way to the banquet (Lords and Ladies: ''Honneur, honneur au Roi!'' &ndash; \"Honor, honor to the King!\"). They are followed by a group of young officers.\n\n'''4. Chorus of Officers and Pages.''' The officers sing of their hope that the call of pleasure will dispel their current ennui (Officers: ''Nargue de la tristesse!'' &ndash; \"Scoff at sorrow\"). Horatio and Marcellus enter in haste, looking for Hamlet. They tell of having seen the ghost of the late King upon the ramparts the previous night. The skeptical officers respond: \"An absurd illusion! Lies and sorcery!\" Undeterred, Horatio and Marcellus leave to find and warn the young prince. The officers, with the lords and ladies, finish the chorus and depart for the banquet. (Again, this scene is unlike the play in which Horatio, who has not seen the ghost himself but has merely heard of it from the sentinels, reports the news of the ghost's appearance to Hamlet directly, and not to a group of soldiers. For some reason Matthew Gurewitsch finds this change somewhat odd: \"Horatio and a sidekick blab the dread news of the Ghost's appearance to a squadron of frolicking young officers, who are totally unimpressed.\")<ref name=Gurewitsch/>\n\n'''<big>Scene 2</big>'''\n\n''The ramparts.

The five-minute prelude sets the sinister atmosphere of the scene.\n\n'''5. Scene at the ramparts.''' Horatio and Marcellus enter (Horatio: ''Viendra-t-il?'' &ndash; \"Will he come?\") and are soon followed by Hamlet (Hamlet: ''Horatio! n'est-ce point vous?'' &ndash; \"Horatio! is that you?\"). Horatio and Marcellus tell Hamlet that they have seen his father's ghost on the previous night at the stroke of twelve. Fanfares are heard emanating from the banquet hall within the castle, and soon thereafter the bells begin to toll midnight. The ghost appears, and they express their fear.\n\n'''Invocation.''' Hamlet addresses the Ghost (Hamlet: ''Spectre infernal! Image vener\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Infernal apparition! Venerated image!\"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders them to do so. The ghost speaks: ''\u00c9coute-moi!'' &ndash; \"Listen to me!\". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: \"Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon my sleep and taking advantage of the hour, poured poison on my sleeping lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn your anger away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven.\" The ghost withdraws, his parting words: ''Souviens-toi!'' &ndash; \"Remember me!\" Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: ''Ombre ch\u00e9re, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton v\u0153u! ... je me souviendrai!'' &ndash; \"Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ... I shall remember!\").

Aria of Oph\u00e9lie.''' Oph\u00e9lie is in the garden with a book in her hand. She laments Hamlet's distance, feeling his look is something like reproach (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Sa main depuis hier n'a pas touch\u00e9 ma main!'' &ndash; \"His hand has not touched mine since yesterday\"). She reads from her book, at first silently, then aloud (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"Adieu, dit-il, ayez-foi!\"'' &ndash; \"'Adieu, he said, trust me!'\"). Hamlet appears on the other side of the garden. (An [[English horn]] plays the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''.) Hamlet sees Oph\u00e9lie and tarries. Again she reads aloud from her book (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"En vous, cruel, j'avais foi! Je vous aimais, aimez moi!\"'' &ndash; \"'In you, O cruel one, I believed. I loved you! Love me too!'\"), then looks at Hamlet. However, he remains silent, then rushes away. Oph\u00e9lie says ruefully: ''Ah! ce livre a dit vrai!'' &ndash; \"Ah! This book spoke the truth!\" and continues her aria (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Les serments on des ailes!'' &ndash; \"Promises have wings!\").\n\n'''7. Recitative and arioso.''' The Queen comes into the garden hoping to find Hamlet. She sees Oph\u00e9lie's distress and presses her for information as to its cause (The Queen: ''Je croyais pr\u00e8s de vous trouver mon fils'' &ndash; \"I thought to find my son with you\"). Oph\u00e9lie says Hamlet no longer loves her and begs permission to leave the court. In the Queen's arioso, one of the finest numbers in the score,<ref name=Forbes22/> she rejects Oph\u00e9lie's request, saying that the barrier between Oph\u00e9lie and Hamlet comes from another source (The Queen: ''Dans sons regards plus sombre'' &ndash; \"In his sombre expression\"). She argues that Oph\u00e9lie's presence may help cure Hamlet of his madness. Oph\u00e9lie says she shall obey and leaves.\n\n'''8. Duet.''' The King now comes into the garden (The King: ''L'\u00e2me de votre fils est \u00e0 jamais troubl\u00e9e, Madame'' &ndash; \"Your son's soul is ever troubled, Madame\"). The Queen suggests Hamlet may have discovered the truth, but Claudius believes he suspects nothing.\n\nAn extended version of this very short duet appears in the piano-vocal score.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 107&ndash;117.</ref> Only the initial phrases of this passage are found in the original full score, and the section which begins with the Queen's phrase ''H\u00e9las! Dieu m'\u00e9pargne la honte'' &ndash; \"Alas! may God spare me the shame\" is marked as a possible cut. The scoring of the remainder of the duet was thought lost. The original manuscript with the full score of the duet was recently found at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] in Paris.<ref name=Forbes22/> The uncut duet is performed in the video recording with [[Simon Keenlyside]] as Hamlet.<ref>[[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref> It is included as an appendix in the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet (see [[#Recordings|Recordings]]).<ref name=Forbes22/>\n\n'''Recitative.''' At the conclusion of the duet Hamlet enters, and the orchestra plays '''Hamlet's Theme'''.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 118&ndash;120.</ref> When the 8-bar theme has concluded, the King calls to Hamlet (The King: ''Cher Hamlet'' &ndash; \"Dear Hamlet\"), and Hamlet responds \"Sire!\". Claudius asks Hamlet to refer to him as Father, but Hamlet responds that his father is dead. Claudius offers his hand, in Hamlet's father's name. There is a pause as the orchestra begins again to play Hamlet's Theme, and Hamlet responds: \"His is cold and lifeless.\" When the theme has finished, Claudius calls Hamlet \"My son...\", but Hamlet angrily responds: \"My name is Hamlet!\", and starts to walk away. The orchestra begins Hamlet's Theme again, and Gertrude asks whether Hamlet seeks the young and beautiful Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet responds that youth and beauty will vanish in a single day. When the orchestra has finished playing Hamlet's Theme, Claudius suggests that Hamlet may wish to travel abroad, to France and Italy, but Hamlet responds he'd rather travel, like the clouds, among the stars, amid bolts of lightning.\n\nThere is a distant sound of festive music. The theme employed is that of the Danish March (which accompanies the entrance of the royal court in the following Play Scene).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 122.</ref> The King tells Hamlet to listen to the sound of the festivities and admonishes him to hold up his head. Hamlet announces he has summoned an itinerant troupe of actors to provide entertainment. Claudius agrees to this, and then says to Gertrude, \"He knows nothing!\", but she replies \"I am afraid!\" as they turn to leave. The orchestra begins to play the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and Hamlet sings: ''Mon p\u00e9re! Patience! Patience!'' &ndash; \"My father! Patience! Patience!\".<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 124.</ref>\n\n'''9. Recitative and chorus of comedians.''' Marcellus and Horatio enter with the Players (tenors and basses). Marcellus announces: ''Voici les histrions mand\u00e9s par vous, Seigneur.'' &ndash; \"Here are the actors you sent for, my lord.\" The players sing a chorus (Players: ''Princes sans apanages'' &ndash; \"Princes without privilege\").<ref>This chorus is omitted in the video recording with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet. See [[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:14:21).</ref> In an aside Hamlet reveals his true purpose (Hamlet: ''C'est en croyant revoir se dresser sa victime que plus d'un meurtrier a confess\u00e9 son crime'' &ndash; \"In believing he sees his victim rise up, more than one murderer has confessed his crime\"). He asks the players to enact the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'', saying he shall tell them when to pour the poison. He then asks the pages to bring in wine for all.\n\n'''10. ''Chanson Bacchique''.''' Seizing a goblet, Hamlet sings a song in praise of wine (Hamlet: ''\u00d4 vin, dissipe la tristesse qui p\u00e9se sur mon c\u0153ur! \u00c0 moi les r\u00eaves de l'ivresse et le rire moqueur!'' &ndash; \"O wine, dispel the sorrow which weighs on my heart! Give me dreams of euphoria and the mocking laugh!\"). In a florid [[cadenza]] it rises to a high G ([[Scientific pitch notation|G4]]). (An easier version with fewer notes and a lower top note, F ([[Scientific pitch notation|F4]]), is also included in the score.)<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 136.</ref> This drinking song, which is not found in Shakespeare, has been the object of much negative criticism.

The royal throne is on the right, a platform for the courtiers on the left; at the back, a small theatre, curtains closed'' (set by [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]])''.''\n\n'''11. Danish march.''' The entrance of the royal court is accompanied by a four-and-a-half minute [[March (music)|march]] in ''[[alla breve]]'' time and [[Ternary form|A-B-A form]] which is introduced with a fanfare. The theme of the A section was first heard near the end of the trio recitative with Claudius, Hamlet, and Gertrude in the first scene of act 2. The King and Queen enter first, followed by Polonius, Oph\u00e9lie, Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus, and the court.<ref>In the video recording with Simon Keenlyside this scenic transformation occurs with the curtain up. A long banquet table is rolled from the wings at the conclusion of the ''Chanson Bacchique'' as the orchestra finishes playing. Hamlet remains on stage, and after the applause, a truncated version of the march (fanfare and first A section, just under one minute) is heard as Oph\u00e9lie, on the arm of her father Polonius, and Horatio, Marcellus, and the courtiers arrive. The King and Queen arrive last. ([[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref>\n\n'''Recitative and prologue.''' Hamlet asks Oph\u00e9lie if he may sit at her feet (Hamlet: ''Belle, permettez-nous'' &ndash; \"Lady, permit me\"). She responds that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, his eyes fixed on the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a [[saxophone]] solo. (According to Annegret Fauser this is the first instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.)<ref>Fauser (1993), p.</ref> In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: ''Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez p\u00e2lir, dites-le moi!'' &ndash; \"Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!\").\n\n'''12. Pantomime and finale.''' On the small stage an aged king wearing a crown enters slowly on the arm of a queen whose features and costume are similar to those of Queen Gertrude. Hamlet, whose eyes never leave the face of King Claudius, narrates the action of the mimed play (Hamlet: ''C'est le vieux Roi Gonzague et la Reine Geni\u00e8vre'' &ndash; \"This is the aged King Gonzago and Queen Guinevere\"). The play proceeds as follows: With protestations of love Guinevere leads Gonzago to a lonely spot. The drowsy king soon falls asleep in her arms. The villain enters. She holds out a cup, he seizes it, and pours the fatal potion, then takes the crown and places it on his head.\n\nAt this point Hamlet interrupts his narrative and addresses Claudius directly (Hamlet: ''Sire, vous p\u00e2lissez'' &ndash; \"Sire, you grow pale!\"). Angered and fearful, the King rises (The King: ''Chassez, chassez d'ici ces vils histrions!'' &ndash; \"Expel, expel these vile minstrels!\"). Hamlet, feigning madness, accuses Claudius of the murder of his father (Hamlet: ''C'est lui qui versait le poison!'' &ndash; \"He's the one who poured the poison!\"). Hamlet approaches the King, pushing aside the courtiers who surround him, and snatches the crown from Claudius' head (Hamlet: ''A bas, masque menteur! vaine couronne, \u00e0 bas!'' &ndash; \"Down with the lying mask! Down with the empty crown!\").\n\nThe King, pulling himself together, solemnly declares: ''\u00d4 mortelle offense! Aveugle d\u00e9mence, qui glace tous les c\u0153urs d'effroi!'' &ndash; \"O fatal insult! Blind lunacy, which chills every heart with dread!\" The melody of the vocal line is a variant of the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise'''. Oph\u00e9lie cries out, and the Queen declares her outrage (The Queen: ''Dans sa folle rage, il brave, il outrage'' &ndash; \"In his mad rage, he defies, he offends\"). These utterances of the King and the Queen begin a grand ensemble passage, \"a magnificent septet\",<ref name=Forbes611>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''2''': 611.</ref> which builds to a climax in which Hamlet bursts out in \"mad Berlioz-like excitement\"<ref name=Greenfield/> with snatches of the '''''Chanson Bacchique'''''. At the end, Hamlet totally collapses. The King rushes out, followed by the Queen, and the entire court.\n\n===Act 3===\n'''<big>\"Closet Scene\"</big>'''\n\n''A chamber in the Queen's apartments. At the back are two full-length portraits of the two kings. A [[prie-Dieu]]. A lamp burns on a table'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''Entr'acte.''' The act begins with a short but powerful introduction, \"almost Verdian\"<ref name=Salter /> in its effect. Fortissimo French horns play the variant of '''Hamlet's Promise''' (the King's ''\u00d4 mortelle offense!'') which began the septet that closed act 2. The music becomes more agitated, reflecting Hamlet's highly conflicted state of mind. The trumpets sound mutated snippets of the royal court's Danish march.<ref name=Fauser />\n\n'''13. Monologue.''' Hamlet is alone and seated on a couch. He chastises himself for his failure to act (Hamlet: ''J'ai pu frapper le mis\u00e9rable'' &ndash; \"I could have killed the scoundrel.\") This leads to a calmer, more introspective section (Hamlet: ''\u00catre ou ne pas \u00eatre'' &ndash; \"To be or not to be\"), which follows the Shakespeare original closely, although greatly shortened.<ref name=Gurewitsch/><ref name=\"Forbes24\"/> He hears someone approaching (Hamlet: ''Mais qui donc ose ici me suivre? Le Roi!...'' &ndash; \"But who then dares to follow me here? The King!...\"). He hides behind a tapestry (arras).\n\n'''14. Recitative and bass aria.''' The King enters. He muses to himself (The King: ''C'est en vain que j'ai cru me soustraire aux remords.'' &ndash; \"In vain have I thought to escape my remorse.\"). The King kneels at the prie-Dieu and prays aloud (The King: ''Je t'implore, \u00f4 mon fr\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"I implore you, O my brother!\"). Hamlet overhears and fears Claudius' remorse could yet save his soul. He therefore delays yet again, deciding that Claudius must be dispatched in drunken revels at the court. The King rises. Thinking he has seen a ghost, he calls out for Polonius. Polonius comes rushing in. The King tells him he has seen the ghost of the dead king. Polonius tries to calm the King and warns him to beware lest a word betray them both. The King rushes out followed by Polonius. Hamlet emerges from behind the tapestry (Hamlet: ''Polonius est son complice! le p\u00e8re d'Oph\u00e9lie!'' &ndash; \"Polonius is his accomplice. Ophelia's father!\"). He regrets having overheard this terrible revelation.\n\n[[File:Nellie Melba as Ophelia in Hamlet (opera) - Henri Gervex ON2010-03-12.jpg|thumb|[[Nellie Melba]] as Oph\u00e9lie, by [[Henri Gervex]]]]\n'''15. Trio.''' Oph\u00e9lie enters with the Queen. (The Queen: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je veux lire enfin dans sa pens\u00e9e'' &ndash; \"There he is! I must know what is on his mind\"). The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: ''Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse!'' &ndash; \"May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated marriage can be solemnized!\"). Oph\u00e9lie asks what he means. He responds: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie.'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie.\"). The Queen asks whether he has forgotten all Oph\u00e9lie's virtues. He replies he now feels nothing in his heart. Oph\u00e9lie despairs (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Cet amor promis \u00e0 genoux'' &ndash; \"The love that on your knees you swore\"). She returns her ring to him ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Oph\u00e9lie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie\"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Oph\u00e9lie leaves, hiding her tears.\n\n'''16. Duet.''' The Queen warns Hamlet that he has offended his father, and she may be powerless to save his life (The Queen: ''Hamlet, ma douleur est immense!'' &ndash; \"Hamlet, my grief is great!\"). Hamlet asks, who has offended his father? She denies any understanding of his meaning. Hamlet blocks her attempt to leave, tries to force her to confront her guilt (Hamlet: ''Ah! que votre \u00e2me sans refuge pleure sur les devoirs trahis'' &ndash; \"Ah! Let your defenseless heart weep over duties betrayed\"). Hamlet leads his mother to the two portraits and points to the portrait of his father (Hamlet: ''Ici la gr\u00e2ce et la beaut\u00e9 sereines'' &ndash; \"Here are grace and serene beauty\"), then to the other portrait (''L\u00e0, tous les crimes de la terre!'' &ndash; \"There, all crimes of the earth!\"). The Queen begs for mercy, kneeling before Hamlet (The Queen: ''Pardonne, h\u00e9las! ta voix m'accable!'' &ndash; Forgive me, alas! Your voice devastates me!\"). The Queen collapses on a couch. The orchestra repeats the distinctive [[ostinato]] first heard in the Ramparts Scene as the accompaniment to Hamlet's aria (''Spectre infernal!''). The light dims, and the Ghost appears behind the couch, one arm extended toward Hamlet (Ghost: ''Mon fils!'' &ndash; \"My son!\"). Hamlet pulls back in confusion. The Ghost warns Hamlet (Ghost: ''Souviens-toi... mais \u00e9pargne ta m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Do not forget... but spare your mother!\"). As the Ghost vanishes, the orchestra plays the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and the doors close themselves. Hamlet asks his mother not to think he is mad; his rage has calmed. He tells her to repent and sleep in peace, then leaves. She collapses at the foot of the prie-Dieu.\n\nElizabeth Forbes states that the final duet of act 3 represents the climax of the act and the pivotal scene of the entire opera,<ref name=Forbes24 /> and the act as a whole \"is by far the finest of the opera, musically as well as dramatically.\"<ref name=Forbes22 />\n\n===Act 4===\n''A pastoral spot surrounded by trees. At the back, a lake dotted with verdant islets and bordered with willows and rushes. The day breaks and floods the scene with cheerful light'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''17. Entr'acte.'''

A party of young Danish peasants enters, and a spring country festival ensues (Peasants: ''Voici la riante saison'' \u2013 \"The fun season is here\").\n: '''B\u2013F.''' The ballet proper, which lasts about 18 minutes, consists of the following sections:\n:: B. Pas des chasseurs\n:: C. Pantomime\n:: D. Valse-Mazurka\n:: E. Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet \u2013 La Freya\n:: F. Strette finale\n\nThe recording conducted by [[Richard Bonynge]] (with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet and [[Joan Sutherland]] as Ophelia) includes the ballet music in its proper place at the beginning of act 4, but omits significant portions of it.<!--\n\n--><ref>Bonynge's recording is based on a production he prepared for Sydney, Australia. The cuts include (page nos. refer to the [[#Scores|piano-vocal score]]): in the \"Danse Villageoise\", the second repeat (pp. 242\u2013243) and 24 bars of the chorus (pp. 247\u2013248); in the \"Pas des chasseurs\", the final 71 bars of 121 total (pp. 253\u2013255) [the recording with Hampson also omits the final 20 bars as given in the vocal score; these may not be in the full score]; in the \"Valse-Mazurke\", the repeated section with the first and second ending (pp. 260\u2013261) as well as the first 16 bars of the following section (p. 262), the first 7 bars at the top of p. 264, the final 20 bars on p. 265, and 6 bars beginning 11 bars from the end (p. 266); in the \"Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet,\" the final 10 bars marked \"Un peu plus lent\" (p. 267); in \"La Freya\", the first four pages (268\u2013271) out of eleven total; and in the \"Strette finale\", only the first 22 bars of the 62-bar Allegro are played before a jump to the section marked \"Moins vite\" on p. 282. In total, these cuts reduce the ballet proper (sections B\u2013F) to less than 15 minutes of music.

The peasants see a young girl approaching (Peasants: ''Mais quelle est cette belle et jeune demoiselle'' \u2013 \"But who is this fair young maiden\").\n\nOph\u00e9lie enters, dressed in a long white gown and with her hair bizarrely adorned with flowers and creepers (Oph\u00e9lie: ''A vos jeux, mes amis, permettez-moi de gr\u00e2ce de prendre part!'' \u2013 \"My friends, please allow me to join in your games!\"). Oph\u00e9lie's opening recitative is interrupted by a [[florid music|florid]] [[cadenza]] with an ascending run up to a [[Trill (music)|trill]] on a [[forte (music)|forte]] A ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5]]).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 287.</ref>\n\n'''Andante.''' Oph\u00e9lie tells the peasants that, should they hear that Hamlet has forgotten her, they should not believe it (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Un doux serment nous lie'' \u2013 \"A tender promise binds us to each other\").

In a more difficult alternative version, the trill on F finishes with an upward leap to forte high D ([[Scientific pitch notation|D6]]) and a quick passage descending to middle B-flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}4]]), followed by an upward octave leap to a final forte high B flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}5]]) which is held.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 292.</ref>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Final cadenza Valse Mad Scene Hamlet (piano-vocal score p292).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Final cadenza and variant from the Valse ([[#PianoVocalScore|piano-vocal score, p. 292]])]]\n|{{Spaces|10}}\n|}\n\n'''Ballade.''' In the mournful Ballade, Oph\u00e9lie sings about the Willis (water sprite) who lures lovers to their death, dragging them under the water until they drown (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Et maintenant \u00e9coutez ma chanson. P\u00e2le et blonde, dort sous l'onde profonde'' \u2013 \"And now listen to my song. Pale and fair, sleeping under the deep waves\"). (The Ballade replaces Shakespeare's \"Tomorrow is St. Valentine's Day\", the bawdy words of which were probably considered inappropriate at the Op\u00e9ra.)<ref name=Forbes24/> It includes a quantity of coloratura singing, and, in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, is \"interwoven with a wordless wisp of a refrain, spun out over the nervous pulse of a drum, like birdsong from some undiscovered country.\"<ref name=Gurewitsch/> The Ballade concludes with a coloratura passage that finishes with a run up to a high E ([[Scientific pitch notation|E6]]) and a fortissimo [[Trill (music)|trill]] on A sharp ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5 sharp]]) leading to the final high B ([[Scientific pitch notation|B5]]).<ref name=Forbes24/><ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 300.</ref>\n\n'''19. Waltz-Ballet.''' A short choral passage (Peasants: ''Sa raison a fui sans retour'' \u2013 \"Her reason has fled, never to return\") introduces an orchestral reprise of the waltz music first heard before the Ballade.\n\n'''20. Finale.''' The final section begins with a soft woodwind chord followed by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment ''\u00e0 bouches ferm\u00e9es'' (similar to the \"Humming Chorus\" from Puccini's later opera, ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'') which repeats the theme from ''P\u00e2le et blonde''. Oph\u00e9lie sings: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je crois l'entendre!'' \u2013 \"There he is! I think I hear him!\". As she leans over the water, holding onto the branches of a willow with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love''')<ref name=Fauser/> from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' \u2013 \"Doubt that the light illumines\"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.)<ref name=GertrudeActIVSc7>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=19190 Getrude's monologue from ''Hamlet'', act 4, scene 7, at \"The Lied and Art Song Texts Page\"].</ref>\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Forbes, the opera's initial success at the Op\u00e9ra was undoubtedly mostly due to the spectacular vocal effects of the \"Mad Scene\" as executed by the original Oph\u00e9lie, [[Christine Nilsson]].<ref name=Forbes24/>\n\n===Act 5===\n''The graveyard near Elsinore.''\n\n'''21. Song of the Gravediggers.''' Two gravediggers are digging a grave (First Gravedigger: ''Dame ou prince, homme ou femme'' &ndash; \"Lady or prince, man or woman\"). '''Hamlet's Theme''' is heard in the orchestra, and he appears in the distance and slowly approaches (both Gravediggers: ''Jeune ou vieux, brune ou blonde'' &ndash; \"Young or old, dark or fair\"). They drink and sing of the pleasures of wine. Hamlet asks for whom the grave is intended. The gravediggers do not remember. (After this shortened version of the gravediggers scene, the action diverges radically from that of the Shakespeare play.)\n\n'''22. Recitative and arioso.''' Hamlet, realizing that Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad, but still unaware that she is dead, begs forgiveness for his ill treatment of her (Hamlet: ''Comme une p\u00e2le fleur'' &ndash; \"Like a delicate flower\").\n\nThe English music critic [[John Steane]], reviewing [[Simon Keenlyside]]'s performance of this aria, wrote:<blockquote>Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and brings out the best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we know from the tenor solos in ''Mignon'', adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.<ref>[[John Steane]], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', September 2003, p. 20.</ref></blockquote>\n\n'''Scene and recitative.''' La\u00ebrte appears in the distance, enveloped in a cape (Hamlet: ''Mais qui marche dans l'ombre? Horatio?'' &ndash; \"Who walks in the shadows? Horatio?\"). Hamlet calls out to him, and La\u00ebrte answers and comes nearer (La\u00ebrte: ''Vous avez fr\u00e9mi, Prince? ... Oui, je suis de retour; c'est moi!'' &ndash; \"Were you afraid, Prince? ... Yes, I have returned; it is I!\"). Knowing of Oph\u00e9lie's death, La\u00ebrte seeks revenge, and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded.\n\n'''23. Funeral march and chorus.''' A funeral march is heard (Hamlet: ''\u00c9coute! Quel est ce bruit de pas?'' &ndash; \"Listen! What noise is that?\"). He asks La\u00ebrte: \"Who has died?\" La\u00ebrte, in an aside, is amazed that Hamlet still does not know. The funeral procession appears, led by a choir of men and women (Choir: ''Comme la fleur, comme la fleur nouvelle'' &ndash; \"Like a flower, like a fresh flower\"). Oph\u00e9lie's body is carried in; the King and Queen, Polonius, Marcellus, Horatio and the courtiers follow behind.\n\n'''24. Finale.''' Hamlet finally realizes who has died (Hamlet: ''Oph\u00e9lie! ... Morte! glac\u00e9e! \u00d4 crime! Oh! de leurs noirs complots d\u00e9plorable victime!'' &ndash; \"Oph\u00e9lie! ... Dead! Cold! A crime! Oh! Lamentable victim of their black conspiracy!\"). He kneels beside the body of Oph\u00e9lie: \"I have lost you!\" As the grieving Hamlet prepares to kill himself, his father's Ghost appears, visible to everyone. The King cries out \"Mercy!\", and the Ghost responds: \"The hour has passed! You, my son, finish what you have begun!\" Hamlet cries: \"Ah! Strengthen my arm to run him through. Guide my strike!\" He hurls himself upon the King. The King falls. The Queen cries out \"Dieu!\" as the others exclaim: \"The King!\" Hamlet responds: \"No! The murderer! The murderer of my father!\" The Ghost affirms: \"The crime is avenged! The cloister awaits your mother!\" The King dies with the words: ''Je meur maudit!'' &ndash; \"I die accursed!\" The Queen begs God for forgiveness, as the Ghost declares: \"Live for your people, Hamlet! God has made you King.\" Hamlet, in despair, sings: ''Mon \u00e2me est dans la tombe, h\u00e9las! Et je suis Roi!'' &ndash; \"My spirit is in the grave, alas! And I am King!\" Everyone else proclaims: \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\" and the opera ends.\n\n===Alternative endings===\nA shorter version of the Finale, in which Hamlet dies, and the Ghost does not appear, is called \"le d\u00e9nouement du [[Covent Garden Theatre|The\u00e2tre de Covent Garden]]\" (\"the ending for Covent Garden\"). Thomas may have written it in the belief that the English would not accept an adaptation in which Hamlet lives. There is no evidence, however, that it was performed in Thomas's lifetime, either at Covent Garden or anywhere else. It appears in some German vocal scores and is included as an appendix to the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet.\n\nThere is an additional ending prepared by [[Richard Bonynge]] for a performance in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] in 1982 in which Hamlet dies of his wound suffered in the duel with La\u00ebrte. This ending appears in the recording with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet, conducted by Bonynge.<ref name=\"Forbes26\"/>\n\n==Recordings==\n'''Audio'''\n* [[Sherrill Milnes]] (Hamlet); [[Joan Sutherland]] (Oph\u00e9lie); [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]] (Claudius); [[G\u00f6sta Winbergh]] (La\u00ebrte); [[Barbara Smith Conrad|Barbara Conrad]] (Gertrude); [[John Tomlinson (bass)|John Tomlinson]] (Ghost); Keith Lewis (Marcellus); Philip Gelling (Horatio); Arwel Huw Morgan (Polonius); Peyo Garazzi (First Gravedigger); Joseph Rouleau (Second Gravedigger); Orchestra and Chorus of [[Welsh National Opera]]; [[Richard Bonynge]] (conductor).

On 11 September 1827 the Irish actress [[Harriet Smithson]] played the part of Ophelia in ''Hamlet''.<ref name=Cairns1969p70>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], p. 70.</ref>\n[[File:Harriet Smithson as Ophelia 1827 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Harriet Smithson as Ophelia (1827)]]\nHer mad scene appeared to owe little to tradition and seemed almost like an improvisation, with several contemporary accounts remarking on her astonishing capacity for mime. Her performances produced an extraordinary reaction: men wept openly in the theater, and when they left were \"convulsed by uncontrollable emotion.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p619>[[#Cairns1969|Cairns, David (1969)]], pp. 619&ndash;620.</ref> The twenty-five-year-old [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]], who was about to embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, \"far surpassing all my expectations\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 247.</ref> The French composer [[Hector Berlioz]] was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: \"The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before me at a stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths. I recognized the meaning of dramatic grandeur, beauty, truth.\"<ref name=Cairns1969p70/> Even the wife of the [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|English ambassador]], Lady Granville, felt compelled to report that the Parisians \"roar over Miss Smithson's Ophelia, and strange to say so did I\".<ref>[[#Cairns1999|Cairns, David (1999)]], p. 248.</ref> (The actress's Irish accent and the lack of power in her voice had hindered her success in London.)<ref name=Cairns1969p619/> It wasn't long before new clothing and hair styles, ''\u00e0 la mode d'Oph\u00e9lie'' and modeled on those of the actress, became all the rage in Paris.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nNot everything about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found by many to be laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal ''Pandore'' wrote about \"that English candour which allows everything to be expressed and everything to be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/> Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him \"what I was searching for, what I lacked, what I had to find &ndash; actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes\".<ref name=Cairns1999p247/>\n\nThe composer Berlioz was soon totally infatuated with Miss Smithson. His love for her, initially unrequited, became an obsession and served as inspiration for his music. His ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (''Fantastic Symphony'', 1830) portrays an opium-induced vision in which the musician's beloved appears as a recurrent musical motif, the ''id\u00e9e fixe'', which like any obsession \"finds its way into every incredible situation [movement]\".<ref>Milder, John (1963).

Besides in music, it also manifested itself in art. [[Auguste Pr\u00e9ault]]'s relief ''Oph\u00e9lie'' (1844) depicted a young woman wading into water with her hair let down and swirling in the current.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n===French versions of the play===\n[[File:DUMAS PERE.jpg|thumb|Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]\nBy the early 1840s [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]], who had become a personal friend of Berlioz and Smithson,<ref>[[#Barzun|Barzun, Jacques (1969)]], '''1''': 277, 315.</ref> had achieved international fame with his historical novels and dramas. With the heightened interest in Shakespeare, and in particular ''Hamlet'', that had been aroused by Smithson's performances at the Od\u00e9on, he decided to prepare a new French translation of the play to be presented at his [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]]. An earlier verse translation of ''Hamlet'' into French by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ducis]], first performed in 1769, was still being given at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and Dumas knew the leading role by heart. The Ducis play bore very little resemblance to the Shakespeare original. There were far fewer characters: no ghost, no Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, no players, no gravediggers. There was no duel, and Hamlet did not die at the end. Modifications such as these were necessary to gain performances in the French theaters of his time. Ducis had told the English actor-impresario [[David Garrick]] that a ghost which speaks, itinerant players, and a fencing duel were \"absolutely inadmissible\" on the French stage.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 97.</ref> Dumas realized that Ducis' play was not the same as the original: Pierre Le Tourneur had published a relatively faithful prose translation, not intended for performance, in 1779. Nevertheless, moral propriety and ''politesse'' dictated that only such highly sanitized versions as that of Ducis could be performed on stage. The French referred to these performing editions as ''imitations'', and most knew that they were highly modified versions of the original. All the same, Ducis was at first accused of polluting French theaters with Shakespeare; only much later was he indicted for mutilating the original.<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 98.</ref>\n\nDumas could not speak or read English well. He needed help, so he selected a younger writer by the name of [[Paul Meurice]] from among his coterie of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and assistants. Meurice had earlier collaborated with [[Auguste Vacquerie]] on ''Falstaff'', a combination of [[Henry IV, Part 1|Parts I]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|II of Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'']], which had been presented at the Od\u00e9on in 1842. The Dumas-Meurice ''Hamlet'' was performed at Dumas' Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique in 1847 and had an enormous success. (With some alterations the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise took it into repertory in 1886, and it continued to be performed in France until the middle of the 20th century.)<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe Dumas-Meurice version was more faithful to Shakespeare and restored much of what was missing from the Ducis version, including Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the ghost, the duel, and the gravediggers. Still, by modern standards, it was a rather free adaptation of the original. Fortinbras was dropped, and the entire opening scene with the sentinels on the ramparts of the castle was excised. A love scene between Hamlet and Ophelia was added to the first act. Claudius does not send Hamlet to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern do not die. Notably, at the end of the play, as Gertrude, Claudius, and Laertes are dying, the ghost of Hamlet's father reappears and condemns each of the dying characters. To Claudius it says: ''D\u00e9sesp\u00e8re et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Despair and die!\"; to Laertes: ''Prie et meurs!'' &ndash; \"Pray and die!\"; and to the Queen: ''Esp\u00e8re et meure!'' &ndash; \"Hope and die!\". When the wounded Hamlet asks: ''Et quel ch\u00e2timent m'attend donc?'' &ndash; \"And what punishment awaits me?\", the ghost responds: ''Tu vivras!'' &ndash; \"You shall live!\", and the curtain falls.<ref name=Fauser/><ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], pp. 109\u2013111.</ref>\n\nDumas explained these \"improvements\" to Shakespeare's play by insisting that the original violated plausibility, transgressed decency, and destroyed the dramatic balance. \"Since Hamlet is not guilty to the same degree as the others, he should not die the same death as the others.\" Four dead bodies would constitute \"the most unpleasant effect.\" Since the ghost appears at the beginning of the play, \"it must necessarily reappear to be present at the end.\"<ref>[[#Pemble|Pemble, John (2005)]], p. 111.</ref>\n\n==Preparation of the libretto==\nThe librettists for the opera of ''Hamlet'', Michel Carr\u00e9 and Jules Barbier, were experienced: they had already provided librettos for Thomas' ''Mignon'' and also for Gounod's ''Faust''.<ref name=Forbes21>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 21.</ref> They chose Dumas' version of the play as the basis for their libretto. This was the version with which French audiences of the day were most familiar, and the one against which the opera would be compared and judged.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nWhen adapting a play for opera, it was imperative to shorten and simplify. Traditionally [[grand opera]] conveys plot in broad brushstrokes; the audience is not particularly interested in its intricacies, or its detours and complexities.<ref>White, Nicholas (2003). \"Fictions and librettos\" in Charlton, David, ed. ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Grand Opera]]'', p. 45. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-64683-3}}.</ref> An uncut version of Shakespeare's play had more than 30 characters and could run for over four hours. The libretto reduced the total number of characters to fifteen (counting the four mime players required for the Play scene), and also reduced the number of subplots. Dumas had cut the scene with the sentinels Bernardo and Francisco. Gone also were Voltimand, Cornelius, Osric, and Reynaldo. Like Dumas, Fortinbras was omitted, thus there was no need to mention an invasion from Norway. Dumas omitted the subplot of Hamlet's voyage to England, so Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were also omitted, removing most of the black humor of the play. Polonius' accidental murder in act 4 was excised, and his singing part reduced to only eight measures.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes21/><ref name=Salter>Salter, Lionel (1994). [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/January%201994/99 Review of the recording of ''Hamlet'' with Thomas Hampson]. ''Gramophone'', January 1994.</ref>\n\nThis simplification of characters and subplots focused the drama on Hamlet's predicament and its effects on Oph\u00e9lie and left the opera with essentially 4 main characters: Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie, Claudius and Gertrude. This constellation of roles preserved the tetradic model and the balance of male and female parts which had become established in French grand opera at the time of Meyerbeer's ''[[Robert le diable]]'' in 1831. The libretto originally specified for these roles one soprano (Oph\u00e9lie), one mezzo-soprano (Gertrude), one tenor (Hamlet), and one baritone or bass (Claudius).<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nOther plot changes, such as making L\u00e4erte less cynical and more positive towards Hamlet early on,<ref name=Gurewitsch/> not only simplified the story but heightened the tragedy of their duel in the Gravediggers Scene. Making Gertrude a co-conspirator alongside Claudius, enhanced the dramatic conflict between Hamlet and Gertrude when Hamlet attempts to coerce a confession from her in the Closet Scene. Making Polonius a co-conspirator, as revealed in the Closet Scene, strengthened Hamlet's motivation in rejecting his marriage to Oph\u00e9lie. This crucial change facilitated the transformation of Shakespeare's Ophelia into the opera's Oph\u00e9lie, a creature who dramatically is almost entirely drawn from the 19th-century, whose madness stems not from the actions of a man who creates an intolerable situation, but rather from a man whose withdrawal leaves an emptiness she is unable to fill. Musically, of course, the Mad Scene was one of those audience-pleasing creations which drew upon well-established operatic tradition.<ref name=Fauser/><ref name=Forbes24>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], p. 24.</ref>\n\nAnother change, the addition of Hamlet's drinking song for the Players in act 2, created another opportunity for an audience-pleasing musical number. It also led to a shortening of his instructions to them before the song<ref name=Forbes21/> and could be justified dramatically as a cover for his ulterior motive in asking them to enact the mime play.<ref name=Tubeuf/> In the final scene, in another simplification of the plot, La\u00ebrte, Polonius, and Gertrude survive. As in the Dumas' play, the ghost returns at the end, but unlike in Dumas, the ghost merely banishes Gertrude to a convent for her role in the conspiracy. Finally, exactly as in Dumas, Hamlet lives and is proclaimed King.<ref name=Tubeuf>[[Andr\u00e9 Tubeuf|Tubeuf, Andr\u00e9]]; Corbier, Annie, trans. \"Synopsis\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 30&ndash;32.</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Hamlet (opera) by Thomas, Cover of Piano-Vocal Score.jpg|thumb|Cover of the piano-vocal score of Thomas' ''Hamlet'' (1868)]]\nVery little is known concerning the details of the composition of the music. Thomas may have received the libretto around 1859. The original libretto was in four acts, but the requirements of the authorities at that time specified the premiere at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] of at least one 5-act opera per season.<ref name=Fauser/> The inclusion of a ballet was also obligatory.<ref name=Forbes611/> The fourth and final act, which included the Mad Scene and the Gravediggers Scene, was simply split into two. To confer more weight to the new fourth act, the ballet was added between the choral introduction of the Mad Scene and Oph\u00e9lie's recitative and aria.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\nIn 1863 the director of the Op\u00e9ra, [[\u00c9mile Perrin]], wrote in a letter to a minister of state that Thomas had nearly finished writing the music. Later the press conjectured as to the reason for the delay of the opera, suggesting that Thomas had yet to find his ideal Oph\u00e9lie.<ref name=Fauser/> Thomas' opera ''[[Mignon]]'' (1866), an adaptation of Goethe's novel ''[[Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre]]'', had been the composer's very effective response to Gounod's earlier Goethe adaption, the opera [[Faust (opera)|''Faust'']], which had premiered in 1859. ''Mignon'' had been performed at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]], and Thomas was under pressure to provide a similar success at the Op\u00e9ra, in particular as several of his earlier productions there had done poorly.<ref name=Forbes726>[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], \"Thomas, (Charles Louis) Ambroise\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''4''': 726-727.</ref>\n\nWhen Gounod's Shakespeare adaptation, the opera ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', appeared at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]] in 1867, it provided additional impetus for Thomas to finish working on his own adaptation of ''Hamlet''.<ref>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#HamletCD1993|''Hamlet'' CD Booklet (1993)]], pp. 20&ndash;21.</ref> According to accounts in the press, it was that same year, at his publisher [[Heugel (music publisher)|Heugel]]'s office in Paris, that Thomas met the Swedish soprano [[Christine Nilsson]], who had just been engaged at the Op\u00e9ra. Thomas finally consented to the scheduling of the premiere. Consistent with this press report, parts of the soprano role were altered around this time with Nilsson's capabilities in mind. Thomas replaced a dialog with the women's chorus in the Mad Scene in act 4 with a Swedish Ballade.<ref name=Fauser/> The ballad is [[Neck_(water_spirit)|Neck\u2019s]] [[Polska]], \"Deep in the sea\u201d (in Swedish N\u00e4ckens Polska, \u201cDjupt i hafvet\u201d) with lyrics by [[Arvid August Afzelius]]. The tune is a traditional Swedish folk tune. The ballad is well known in all the Nordic countries, and is also used the first Danish national play [[Elves' Hill]], Deep in the sea (in Danish Elverh\u00f8j  \u201cDybt i havet\u201d).\nIts use was suggested to Thomas by Nilsson.\n\n\nA tenor suitable for the role of Hamlet could not be found, but an outstanding dramatic baritone, [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], was available, so Thomas decided to transpose the part, originally written for a tenor, to baritone. In the event, Faure \"achieved a tremendous personal triumph as Hamlet.\"<ref name=Forbes726/>\n\n\n==Performance history==\nThe work was premiered at the [[Paris Op\u00e9ra]] ([[Salle Le Peletier]]) on 9 March 1868.

Claudius places the crown on Gertrude's head. All leave, and Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters. He is upset that his mother has remarried so soon. Oph\u00e9lie enters, and they sing a love duet. La\u00ebrte, Oph\u00e9lie's brother, enters. He is being sent to Norway and gives his farewells. He entrusts Oph\u00e9lie to the care of Hamlet. Hamlet refuses to join La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie as they leave to join the banquet, and goes off in another direction. Courtiers and soldiers, on their way to the banquet, enter the hall. Horatio and Marcellus tell the soldiers that they have seen the ghost of Hamlet's father on the ramparts of the castle the previous night and go off to tell Hamlet.\n\n''Scene 2: The Ramparts''\n\nHoratio and Marcellus meet Hamlet on the ramparts. The Ghost appears, Horatio and Marcellus leave, and the Ghost tells his son that Claudius murdered him with poison. The Ghost commands Hamlet to take vengeance on Claudius, but Gertrude must be spared. The Ghost withdraws. Hamlet draws his sword and swears to avenge his father.\n\n[[File:Christine Nilsson as Ophelia NGO2-607.jpg|thumb|[[Christina Nilsson|Christine Nilsson]] as Oph\u00e9lie]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: The Gardens''\n\nOph\u00e9lie, reading a book, is concerned at Hamlet's new indifference. Hamlet appears in the distance, but leaves without speaking. The Queen enters. Oph\u00e9lie says she would like to leave the court, but the Queen insists she should stay. Oph\u00e9lie leaves the garden and King Claudius enters. Gertrude suspects that Hamlet now knows about the murder of his father, but Claudius says he does not. Hamlet enters and feigns madness. He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'' and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\n''Scene 2: The Play''\n\nThe King and Queen and the other guests assemble in the castle hall where the stage has been set up. The play begins, and Hamlet narrates. The play tells a story similar to the murder of Hamlet's father. After the \"poison\" is administered, the \"assassin\" places the \"crown\" on his head. Claudius turns pale, rises abruptly, and commands the play to stop and the actors to leave. Hamlet accuses Claudius of the murder of his father, and snatches Claudius' crown from his head. The entire assembly reacts in a grand septet with chorus.\n\n===Act 3===\n''Closet Scene''\n\nIn the Queen's chambers Hamlet delivers the monologue \"To be or not to be\", then hides behind a tapestry. Claudius enters and prays aloud of his remorse. Hamlet, deciding Claudius' soul may be saved, if he is killed while praying, delays yet again. Polonius enters and in his conversation with Claudius reveals his own complicity. The King and Polonius leave, Hamlet emerges, and Gertrude enters with Oph\u00e9lie. The Queen tries to persuade Hamlet to marry Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet, realizing he can no longer marry the daughter of the guilty Polonius, refuses. Oph\u00e9lie returns her ring to Hamlet and leaves. Hamlet tries to force Gertrude to confront her guilt, but she resists. As Hamlet threatens her, he sees the Ghost, who reminds him he must spare his mother.\n\n===Act 4===\n''The Mad Scene''\n\nAfter Hamlet's rejection, Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad and drowns herself in the lake.\n\n===Act 5===\n''Gravediggers Scene''\n\nHamlet comes upon two gravediggers digging a new grave. He asks who has died, but they do not know. He sings of remorse for his ill treatment of Oph\u00e9lie. La\u00ebrte, who has returned from Norway and learned of his sister's death and Hamlet's role in it, enters and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded, but Oph\u00e9lie's funeral procession interrupts the duel. Hamlet finally realizes she is dead. The Ghost appears again and exhorts Hamlet to kill Claudius, which Hamlet does, avenging his father's death. The Ghost affirms Claudius' guilt and Hamlet's innocence. Hamlet, still in despair, is proclaimed King to cries of \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\".\n\n:[In the much shorter \"Covent Garden\" ending the ghost does not appear, and, after Hamlet finally attacks and kills Claudius, he embraces Oph\u00e9lie's body and dies.

Introduction, march and chorus.''' The court celebrates the Coronation of Gertrude, widow of King Hamlet; and her marriage to his brother, Claudius (Courtiers: ''Que nos chants montent jusqu'aux cieux'' &ndash; \"Let our songs rise to the skies\"). The new king, Claudius, stands before his throne on a dais, surrounded by the nobles of the court. His court chancellor, Polonius, is nearby. Queen Gertrude enters, approaches the dais, and bows to the King (Courtiers: ''Salut, \u00f4 Reine bien-aim\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Greetings, O beloved Queen!\"). Polonius hands the King a crown, which he takes and places on her head (The King: ''\u00d4 toi, qui fus la femme de mon fr\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"O you who were my brother's wife\"). Gertrude comments in an [[aside]] to Claudius that she does not see her son Hamlet. Claudius admonishes her to bear herself as a queen. The courtiers sing of their joy as they celebrate the King and Queen's glorious marriage (Courtiers: ''Le deuil fait place aux chants joyeux'' &ndash; \"Mourning gives way to joyful songs\"). The King and Queen leave the hall followed by the courtiers.\n\n'''2. Recitative and duet.''' Prince Hamlet, son of the late King and Gertrude, enters the empty hall. As Hamlet enters, before he begins singing, the low strings in the orchestra play '''Hamlet's Theme''':<ref name=\"Fauser\"/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Hamlet's Theme - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p24).jpg|thumb|500px|Hamlet's Theme from act 1.

Tendresse \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Futile regrets! Ephemeral tenderness!\").\n\nOph\u00e9lie enters. Her entrance is accompanied by '''Oph\u00e9lie's Theme'''. According to the German musicologist Annegret Fauser, Oph\u00e9lie's music contrasts with Hamlet's very regular 8-bar phrase: the 4-bar theme accentuates her nervous character by the use of dotted-note rhythms, a chromatic melody line, and high-range woodwind instruments. The excerpt below ends with 3 bars of florid solo flute music which foreshadows Oph\u00e9lie's [[coloratura]] singing later in the opera.<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Ophelia's Theme - Hamlet - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score pp26-27).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Oph\u00e9lie's Theme from act 1 (first 4 bars).

Hamlet protests he cannot make promises of love one day, only to forget them the next. His heart is not that of a woman. Oph\u00e9lie is distraught at the insult, and Hamlet begs forgiveness.\n\nThe '''duet''' affirms their love (Hamlet, Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' &ndash; \"Doubt that the light\"). The text of the duet is based on Shakespeare's \"Doubt thou the stars are fire\", which is part of a letter from Hamlet to Ophelia which Polonius reads to Gertrude and Claudius. The melody of the vocal line in Hamlet's first phrases has been called the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love for Oph\u00e9lie''' and appears several more times in the opera, with particular poignancy near the end of the Mad Scene (see [[#Mad Scene|below]]).<ref name=Fauser/>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia - Ambroise Thomas (piano-vocal score p30).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Theme of Hamlet's Love for Ophelia from act 1.

They reoccur, usually in modified form, whenever significant situations relevant to the ideas they represent present themselves, although without having, in the Wagnerian sense, a [[leitmotiv]]ic function.<ref name=Fauser/>\n\n'''3. Recitative and cavatina of La\u00ebrte.''' Oph\u00e9lie's brother, La\u00ebrte, enters. He tells Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie that the King is sending him to the court of Norway, and he must leave that very night (unlike in the play where, as Matthew Gurewitsch of ''[[Opera News]]'' has said, he embarks for \"the fleshpots of Paris\").<ref name=Gurewitsch>Gurewitsch, Matthew (March 2010).

(In the play Laertes warns Ophelia to be wary of Hamlet's intentions.) Fanfares are heard as servants and pages pass at the back. La\u00ebrte asks Hamlet and Oph\u00e9lie to come with him to the banquet, but Hamlet declines. The couple separates, as La\u00ebrte and Oph\u00e9lie leave for the banquet, and Hamlet goes off in the other direction. More fanfares are heard as lords and ladies enter on their way to the banquet (Lords and Ladies: ''Honneur, honneur au Roi!'' &ndash; \"Honor, honor to the King!\"). They are followed by a group of young officers.\n\n'''4. Chorus of Officers and Pages.''' The officers sing of their hope that the call of pleasure will dispel their current ennui (Officers: ''Nargue de la tristesse!'' &ndash; \"Scoff at sorrow\"). Horatio and Marcellus enter in haste, looking for Hamlet. They tell of having seen the ghost of the late King upon the ramparts the previous night. The skeptical officers respond: \"An absurd illusion! Lies and sorcery!\" Undeterred, Horatio and Marcellus leave to find and warn the young prince. The officers, with the lords and ladies, finish the chorus and depart for the banquet. (Again, this scene is unlike the play in which Horatio, who has not seen the ghost himself but has merely heard of it from the sentinels, reports the news of the ghost's appearance to Hamlet directly, and not to a group of soldiers. For some reason Matthew Gurewitsch finds this change somewhat odd: \"Horatio and a sidekick blab the dread news of the Ghost's appearance to a squadron of frolicking young officers, who are totally unimpressed.\")<ref name=Gurewitsch/>\n\n'''<big>Scene 2</big>'''\n\n''The ramparts.

The five-minute prelude sets the sinister atmosphere of the scene.\n\n'''5. Scene at the ramparts.''' Horatio and Marcellus enter (Horatio: ''Viendra-t-il?'' &ndash; \"Will he come?\") and are soon followed by Hamlet (Hamlet: ''Horatio! n'est-ce point vous?'' &ndash; \"Horatio! is that you?\"). Horatio and Marcellus tell Hamlet that they have seen his father's ghost on the previous night at the stroke of twelve. Fanfares are heard emanating from the banquet hall within the castle, and soon thereafter the bells begin to toll midnight. The ghost appears, and they express their fear.\n\n'''Invocation.''' Hamlet addresses the Ghost (Hamlet: ''Spectre infernal! Image vener\u00e9e!'' &ndash; \"Infernal apparition! Venerated image!\"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders them to do so. The ghost speaks: ''\u00c9coute-moi!'' &ndash; \"Listen to me!\". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: \"Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon my sleep and taking advantage of the hour, poured poison on my sleeping lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn your anger away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven.\" The ghost withdraws, his parting words: ''Souviens-toi!'' &ndash; \"Remember me!\" Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: ''Ombre ch\u00e9re, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton v\u0153u! ... je me souviendrai!'' &ndash; \"Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ...

The second act begins with a musical interlude of about two minutes, which sets the scene in the garden. After some emphatic introductory orchestral chords and horn calls, harp arpeggios lead into the main section which employs the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love''',<ref name=Fauser/> initially played by horn and strings, followed by solo horn accompanied with clarinet and flute figures reminiscent of bird calls.<ref>[[#Scores|Piano-vocal score]], pp. 85&ndash;86; [[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 10 (48:23&ndash;50:20).</ref>\n\n'''<big>Scene 1</big>'''\n\n''The castle gardens'' (set designed by [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]])''.''\n\n'''6. Aria of Oph\u00e9lie.''' Oph\u00e9lie is in the garden with a book in her hand. She laments Hamlet's distance, feeling his look is something like reproach (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Sa main depuis hier n'a pas touch\u00e9 ma main!'' &ndash; \"His hand has not touched mine since yesterday\"). She reads from her book, at first silently, then aloud (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"Adieu, dit-il, ayez-foi!\"'' &ndash; \"'Adieu, he said, trust me!'\"). Hamlet appears on the other side of the garden. (An [[English horn]] plays the '''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''.) Hamlet sees Oph\u00e9lie and tarries. Again she reads aloud from her book (Oph\u00e9lie: ''\"En vous, cruel, j'avais foi! Je vous aimais, aimez moi!\"'' &ndash; \"'In you, O cruel one, I believed. I loved you! Love me too!'\"), then looks at Hamlet. However, he remains silent, then rushes away. Oph\u00e9lie says ruefully: ''Ah! ce livre a dit vrai!'' &ndash; \"Ah! This book spoke the truth!\" and continues her aria (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Les serments on des ailes!'' &ndash; \"Promises have wings!\").\n\n'''7. Recitative and arioso.''' The Queen comes into the garden hoping to find Hamlet. She sees Oph\u00e9lie's distress and presses her for information as to its cause (The Queen: ''Je croyais pr\u00e8s de vous trouver mon fils'' &ndash; \"I thought to find my son with you\"). Oph\u00e9lie says Hamlet no longer loves her and begs permission to leave the court. In the Queen's arioso, one of the finest numbers in the score,<ref name=Forbes22/> she rejects Oph\u00e9lie's request, saying that the barrier between Oph\u00e9lie and Hamlet comes from another source (The Queen: ''Dans sons regards plus sombre'' &ndash; \"In his sombre expression\"). She argues that Oph\u00e9lie's presence may help cure Hamlet of his madness. Oph\u00e9lie says she shall obey and leaves.\n\n'''8. Duet.''' The King now comes into the garden (The King: ''L'\u00e2me de votre fils est \u00e0 jamais troubl\u00e9e, Madame'' &ndash; \"Your son's soul is ever troubled, Madame\"). The Queen suggests Hamlet may have discovered the truth, but Claudius believes he suspects nothing.\n\nAn extended version of this very short duet appears in the piano-vocal score.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 107&ndash;117.</ref> Only the initial phrases of this passage are found in the original full score, and the section which begins with the Queen's phrase ''H\u00e9las! Dieu m'\u00e9pargne la honte'' &ndash; \"Alas! may God spare me the shame\" is marked as a possible cut. The scoring of the remainder of the duet was thought lost. The original manuscript with the full score of the duet was recently found at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]] in Paris.<ref name=Forbes22/> The uncut duet is performed in the video recording with [[Simon Keenlyside]] as Hamlet.<ref>[[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref> It is included as an appendix in the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet (see [[#Recordings|Recordings]]).<ref name=Forbes22/>\n\n'''Recitative.''' At the conclusion of the duet Hamlet enters, and the orchestra plays '''Hamlet's Theme'''.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], pp. 118&ndash;120.</ref> When the 8-bar theme has concluded, the King calls to Hamlet (The King: ''Cher Hamlet'' &ndash; \"Dear Hamlet\"), and Hamlet responds \"Sire!\". Claudius asks Hamlet to refer to him as Father, but Hamlet responds that his father is dead. Claudius offers his hand, in Hamlet's father's name. There is a pause as the orchestra begins again to play Hamlet's Theme, and Hamlet responds: \"His is cold and lifeless.\" When the theme has finished, Claudius calls Hamlet \"My son...\", but Hamlet angrily responds: \"My name is Hamlet!\", and starts to walk away. The orchestra begins Hamlet's Theme again, and Gertrude asks whether Hamlet seeks the young and beautiful Oph\u00e9lie, but Hamlet responds that youth and beauty will vanish in a single day. When the orchestra has finished playing Hamlet's Theme, Claudius suggests that Hamlet may wish to travel abroad, to France and Italy, but Hamlet responds he'd rather travel, like the clouds, among the stars, amid bolts of lightning.\n\nThere is a distant sound of festive music. The theme employed is that of the Danish March (which accompanies the entrance of the royal court in the following Play Scene).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 122.</ref> The King tells Hamlet to listen to the sound of the festivities and admonishes him to hold up his head. Hamlet announces he has summoned an itinerant troupe of actors to provide entertainment. Claudius agrees to this, and then says to Gertrude, \"He knows nothing!\", but she replies \"I am afraid!\" as they turn to leave. The orchestra begins to play the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and Hamlet sings: ''Mon p\u00e9re! Patience! Patience!'' &ndash; \"My father! Patience! Patience!\".<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 124.</ref>\n\n'''9. Recitative and chorus of comedians.''' Marcellus and Horatio enter with the Players (tenors and basses). Marcellus announces: ''Voici les histrions mand\u00e9s par vous, Seigneur.'' &ndash; \"Here are the actors you sent for, my lord.\" The players sing a chorus (Players: ''Princes sans apanages'' &ndash; \"Princes without privilege\").<ref>This chorus is omitted in the video recording with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet. See [[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter 13 (1:14:21).</ref> In an aside Hamlet reveals his true purpose (Hamlet: ''C'est en croyant revoir se dresser sa victime que plus d'un meurtrier a confess\u00e9 son crime'' &ndash; \"In believing he sees his victim rise up, more than one murderer has confessed his crime\"). He asks the players to enact the play ''The Murder of Gonzago'', saying he shall tell them when to pour the poison. He then asks the pages to bring in wine for all.\n\n'''10. ''Chanson Bacchique''.''' Seizing a goblet, Hamlet sings a song in praise of wine (Hamlet: ''\u00d4 vin, dissipe la tristesse qui p\u00e9se sur mon c\u0153ur! \u00c0 moi les r\u00eaves de l'ivresse et le rire moqueur!'' &ndash; \"O wine, dispel the sorrow which weighs on my heart! Give me dreams of euphoria and the mocking laugh!\"). In a florid [[cadenza]] it rises to a high G ([[Scientific pitch notation|G4]]). (An easier version with fewer notes and a lower top note, F ([[Scientific pitch notation|F4]]), is also included in the score.)<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 136.</ref> This drinking song, which is not found in Shakespeare, has been the object of much negative criticism. [[Edward Greenfield]], on the other hand, has written that \"Thomas brings off a superb dramatic coup with the most memorable of the hero's solos, his drinking song for the players....\"<ref name=Greenfield>Greenfield, Edward (1984). \"Thomas.

The royal throne is on the right, a platform for the courtiers on the left; at the back, a small theatre, curtains closed'' (set by [[Charles-Antoine Cambon]])''.''\n\n'''11. Danish march.''' The entrance of the royal court is accompanied by a four-and-a-half minute [[March (music)|march]] in ''[[alla breve]]'' time and [[Ternary form|A-B-A form]] which is introduced with a fanfare. The theme of the A section was first heard near the end of the trio recitative with Claudius, Hamlet, and Gertrude in the first scene of act 2. The King and Queen enter first, followed by Polonius, Oph\u00e9lie, Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus, and the court.<ref>In the video recording with Simon Keenlyside this scenic transformation occurs with the curtain up. A long banquet table is rolled from the wings at the conclusion of the ''Chanson Bacchique'' as the orchestra finishes playing. Hamlet remains on stage, and after the applause, a truncated version of the march (fanfare and first A section, just under one minute) is heard as Oph\u00e9lie, on the arm of her father Polonius, and Horatio, Marcellus, and the courtiers arrive. The King and Queen arrive last. ([[#Videos|DVD with Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet]], Disc 1, Chapter (1:04:17&ndash;1:08:48).</ref>\n\n'''Recitative and prologue.''' Hamlet asks Oph\u00e9lie if he may sit at her feet (Hamlet: ''Belle, permettez-nous'' &ndash; \"Lady, permit me\"). She responds that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, his eyes fixed on the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a [[saxophone]] solo. (According to Annegret Fauser this is the first instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.)<ref>Fauser (1993), p.</ref> In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: ''Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez p\u00e2lir, dites-le moi!'' &ndash; \"Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!\").\n\n'''12. Pantomime and finale.''' On the small stage an aged king wearing a crown enters slowly on the arm of a queen whose features and costume are similar to those of Queen Gertrude. Hamlet, whose eyes never leave the face of King Claudius, narrates the action of the mimed play (Hamlet: ''C'est le vieux Roi Gonzague et la Reine Geni\u00e8vre'' &ndash; \"This is the aged King Gonzago and Queen Guinevere\"). The play proceeds as follows: With protestations of love Guinevere leads Gonzago to a lonely spot. The drowsy king soon falls asleep in her arms. The villain enters. She holds out a cup, he seizes it, and pours the fatal potion, then takes the crown and places it on his head.\n\nAt this point Hamlet interrupts his narrative and addresses Claudius directly (Hamlet: ''Sire, vous p\u00e2lissez'' &ndash; \"Sire, you grow pale!\"). Angered and fearful, the King rises (The King: ''Chassez, chassez d'ici ces vils histrions!'' &ndash; \"Expel, expel these vile minstrels!\"). Hamlet, feigning madness, accuses Claudius of the murder of his father (Hamlet: ''C'est lui qui versait le poison!'' &ndash; \"He's the one who poured the poison!\"). Hamlet approaches the King, pushing aside the courtiers who surround him, and snatches the crown from Claudius' head (Hamlet: ''A bas, masque menteur! vaine couronne, \u00e0 bas!'' &ndash; \"Down with the lying mask! Down with the empty crown!\").\n\nThe King, pulling himself together, solemnly declares: ''\u00d4 mortelle offense! Aveugle d\u00e9mence, qui glace tous les c\u0153urs d'effroi!'' &ndash; \"O fatal insult! Blind lunacy, which chills every heart with dread!\" The melody of the vocal line is a variant of the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise'''. Oph\u00e9lie cries out, and the Queen declares her outrage (The Queen: ''Dans sa folle rage, il brave, il outrage'' &ndash; \"In his mad rage, he defies, he offends\"). These utterances of the King and the Queen begin a grand ensemble passage, \"a magnificent septet\",<ref name=Forbes611>Forbes, Elizabeth, \"Hamlet\" in [[#NewGroveOpera|Sadie (1992)]] '''2''': 611.</ref> which builds to a climax in which Hamlet bursts out in \"mad Berlioz-like excitement\"<ref name=Greenfield/> with snatches of the '''''Chanson Bacchique'''''. At the end, Hamlet totally collapses. The King rushes out, followed by the Queen, and the entire court.\n\n===Act 3===\n'''<big>\"Closet Scene\"</big>'''\n\n''A chamber in the Queen's apartments. At the back are two full-length portraits of the two kings. A [[prie-Dieu]]. A lamp burns on a table'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''Entr'acte.''' The act begins with a short but powerful introduction, \"almost Verdian\"<ref name=Salter /> in its effect. Fortissimo French horns play the variant of '''Hamlet's Promise''' (the King's ''\u00d4 mortelle offense!'') which began the septet that closed act 2. The music becomes more agitated, reflecting Hamlet's highly conflicted state of mind. The trumpets sound mutated snippets of the royal court's Danish march.<ref name=Fauser />\n\n'''13. Monologue.''' Hamlet is alone and seated on a couch. He chastises himself for his failure to act (Hamlet: ''J'ai pu frapper le mis\u00e9rable'' &ndash; \"I could have killed the scoundrel.\") This leads to a calmer, more introspective section (Hamlet: ''\u00catre ou ne pas \u00eatre'' &ndash; \"To be or not to be\"), which follows the Shakespeare original closely, although greatly shortened.<ref name=Gurewitsch/><ref name=\"Forbes24\"/> He hears someone approaching (Hamlet: ''Mais qui donc ose ici me suivre? Le Roi!...'' &ndash; \"But who then dares to follow me here? The King!...\"). He hides behind a tapestry (arras).\n\n'''14. Recitative and bass aria.''' The King enters. He muses to himself (The King: ''C'est en vain que j'ai cru me soustraire aux remords.'' &ndash; \"In vain have I thought to escape my remorse.\"). The King kneels at the prie-Dieu and prays aloud (The King: ''Je t'implore, \u00f4 mon fr\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"I implore you, O my brother!\"). Hamlet overhears and fears Claudius' remorse could yet save his soul. He therefore delays yet again, deciding that Claudius must be dispatched in drunken revels at the court. The King rises. Thinking he has seen a ghost, he calls out for Polonius. Polonius comes rushing in. The King tells him he has seen the ghost of the dead king. Polonius tries to calm the King and warns him to beware lest a word betray them both. The King rushes out followed by Polonius. Hamlet emerges from behind the tapestry (Hamlet: ''Polonius est son complice! le p\u00e8re d'Oph\u00e9lie!'' &ndash; \"Polonius is his accomplice. Ophelia's father!\"). He regrets having overheard this terrible revelation.\n\n[[File:Nellie Melba as Ophelia in Hamlet (opera) - Henri Gervex ON2010-03-12.jpg|thumb|[[Nellie Melba]] as Oph\u00e9lie, by [[Henri Gervex]]]]\n'''15. Trio.''' Oph\u00e9lie enters with the Queen. (The Queen: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je veux lire enfin dans sa pens\u00e9e'' &ndash; \"There he is! I must know what is on his mind\"). The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: ''Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse!'' &ndash; \"May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated marriage can be solemnized!\"). Oph\u00e9lie asks what he means. He responds: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie.'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie.\"). The Queen asks whether he has forgotten all Oph\u00e9lie's virtues. He replies he now feels nothing in his heart. Oph\u00e9lie despairs (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Cet amor promis \u00e0 genoux'' &ndash; \"The love that on your knees you swore\"). She returns her ring to him ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love'''), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Oph\u00e9lie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: ''Non! Allez dans un clo\u00eetre, allez, Oph\u00e9lie'' &ndash; \"No! Go to a nunnery, go, Oph\u00e9lie\"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Oph\u00e9lie leaves, hiding her tears.\n\n'''16. Duet.''' The Queen warns Hamlet that he has offended his father, and she may be powerless to save his life (The Queen: ''Hamlet, ma douleur est immense!'' &ndash; \"Hamlet, my grief is great!\"). Hamlet asks, who has offended his father? She denies any understanding of his meaning. Hamlet blocks her attempt to leave, tries to force her to confront her guilt (Hamlet: ''Ah! que votre \u00e2me sans refuge pleure sur les devoirs trahis'' &ndash; \"Ah! Let your defenseless heart weep over duties betrayed\"). Hamlet leads his mother to the two portraits and points to the portrait of his father (Hamlet: ''Ici la gr\u00e2ce et la beaut\u00e9 sereines'' &ndash; \"Here are grace and serene beauty\"), then to the other portrait (''L\u00e0, tous les crimes de la terre!'' &ndash; \"There, all crimes of the earth!\"). The Queen begs for mercy, kneeling before Hamlet (The Queen: ''Pardonne, h\u00e9las! ta voix m'accable!'' &ndash; Forgive me, alas! Your voice devastates me!\"). The Queen collapses on a couch. The orchestra repeats the distinctive [[ostinato]] first heard in the Ramparts Scene as the accompaniment to Hamlet's aria (''Spectre infernal!''). The light dims, and the Ghost appears behind the couch, one arm extended toward Hamlet (Ghost: ''Mon fils!'' &ndash; \"My son!\"). Hamlet pulls back in confusion. The Ghost warns Hamlet (Ghost: ''Souviens-toi... mais \u00e9pargne ta m\u00e8re!'' &ndash; \"Do not forget... but spare your mother!\"). As the Ghost vanishes, the orchestra plays the theme of '''Hamlet's Promise''', and the doors close themselves. Hamlet asks his mother not to think he is mad; his rage has calmed. He tells her to repent and sleep in peace, then leaves. She collapses at the foot of the prie-Dieu.\n\nElizabeth Forbes states that the final duet of act 3 represents the climax of the act and the pivotal scene of the entire opera,<ref name=Forbes24 /> and the act as a whole \"is by far the finest of the opera, musically as well as dramatically.\"<ref name=Forbes22 />\n\n===Act 4===\n''A pastoral spot surrounded by trees. At the back, a lake dotted with verdant islets and bordered with willows and rushes. The day breaks and floods the scene with cheerful light'' (set by [[\u00c9douard Desplechin]])''.''\n\n'''17. Entr'acte.''' A short musical interlude of about two minutes, which features a soft, [[legato]] clarinet solo, introduces the fourth act.\n\n'''Ballet:''' ''La F\u00eate du printemps (Celebration of Spring).

A party of young Danish peasants enters, and a spring country festival ensues (Peasants: ''Voici la riante saison'' \u2013 \"The fun season is here\").\n: '''B\u2013F.''' The ballet proper, which lasts about 18 minutes, consists of the following sections:\n:: B. Pas des chasseurs\n:: C. Pantomime\n:: D. Valse-Mazurka\n:: E. Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet \u2013 La Freya\n:: F. Strette finale\n\nThe recording conducted by [[Richard Bonynge]] (with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet and [[Joan Sutherland]] as Ophelia) includes the ballet music in its proper place at the beginning of act 4, but omits significant portions of it.<!--\n\n--><ref>Bonynge's recording is based on a production he prepared for Sydney, Australia. The cuts include (page nos. refer to the [[#Scores|piano-vocal score]]): in the \"Danse Villageoise\", the second repeat (pp. 242\u2013243) and 24 bars of the chorus (pp. 247\u2013248); in the \"Pas des chasseurs\", the final 71 bars of 121 total (pp. 253\u2013255) [the recording with Hampson also omits the final 20 bars as given in the vocal score; these may not be in the full score]; in the \"Valse-Mazurke\", the repeated section with the first and second ending (pp. 260\u2013261) as well as the first 16 bars of the following section (p. 262), the first 7 bars at the top of p. 264, the final 20 bars on p. 265, and 6 bars beginning 11 bars from the end (p. 266); in the \"Sc\u00e8ne du bouquet,\" the final 10 bars marked \"Un peu plus lent\" (p. 267); in \"La Freya\", the first four pages (268\u2013271) out of eleven total; and in the \"Strette finale\", only the first 22 bars of the 62-bar Allegro are played before a jump to the section marked \"Moins vite\" on p. 282. In total, these cuts reduce the ballet proper (sections B\u2013F) to less than 15 minutes of music.

Oph\u00e9lie's opening recitative is interrupted by a [[florid music|florid]] [[cadenza]] with an ascending run up to a [[Trill (music)|trill]] on a [[forte (music)|forte]] A ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5]]).<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 287.</ref>\n\n'''Andante.''' Oph\u00e9lie tells the peasants that, should they hear that Hamlet has forgotten her, they should not believe it (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Un doux serment nous lie'' \u2013 \"A tender promise binds us to each other\").

In a more difficult alternative version, the trill on F finishes with an upward leap to forte high D ([[Scientific pitch notation|D6]]) and a quick passage descending to middle B-flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}4]]), followed by an upward octave leap to a final forte high B flat ([[Scientific pitch notation|B{{music|b}}5]]) which is held.<ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 292.</ref>\n{| align=\"center\"\n|-\n|[[File:Final cadenza Valse Mad Scene Hamlet (piano-vocal score p292).jpg|thumbnail|500px|Final cadenza and variant from the Valse ([[#PianoVocalScore|piano-vocal score, p. 292]])]]\n|{{Spaces|10}}\n|}\n\n'''Ballade.''' In the mournful Ballade, Oph\u00e9lie sings about the Willis (water sprite) who lures lovers to their death, dragging them under the water until they drown (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Et maintenant \u00e9coutez ma chanson. P\u00e2le et blonde, dort sous l'onde profonde'' \u2013 \"And now listen to my song. Pale and fair, sleeping under the deep waves\"). (The Ballade replaces Shakespeare's \"Tomorrow is St. Valentine's Day\", the bawdy words of which were probably considered inappropriate at the Op\u00e9ra.)<ref name=Forbes24/> It includes a quantity of coloratura singing, and, in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, is \"interwoven with a wordless wisp of a refrain, spun out over the nervous pulse of a drum, like birdsong from some undiscovered country.\"<ref name=Gurewitsch/> The Ballade concludes with a coloratura passage that finishes with a run up to a high E ([[Scientific pitch notation|E6]]) and a fortissimo [[Trill (music)|trill]] on A sharp ([[Scientific pitch notation|A5 sharp]]) leading to the final high B ([[Scientific pitch notation|B5]]).<ref name=Forbes24/><ref>[[#PianoVocalScore|Thomas, Ambroise (1868)]], p. 300.</ref>\n\n'''19.

A short choral passage (Peasants: ''Sa raison a fui sans retour'' \u2013 \"Her reason has fled, never to return\") introduces an orchestral reprise of the waltz music first heard before the Ballade.\n\n'''20. Finale.''' The final section begins with a soft woodwind chord followed by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment ''\u00e0 bouches ferm\u00e9es'' (similar to the \"Humming Chorus\" from Puccini's later opera, ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'') which repeats the theme from ''P\u00e2le et blonde''. Oph\u00e9lie sings: ''Le voil\u00e0! Je crois l'entendre!'' \u2013 \"There he is! I think I hear him!\". As she leans over the water, holding onto the branches of a willow with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody ('''Theme of Hamlet's Love''')<ref name=Fauser/> from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Oph\u00e9lie: ''Doute de la lumi\u00e8re'' \u2013 \"Doubt that the light illumines\"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.)<ref name=GertrudeActIVSc7>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=19190 Getrude's monologue from ''Hamlet'', act 4, scene 7, at \"The Lied and Art Song Texts Page\"].</ref>\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Forbes, the opera's initial success at the Op\u00e9ra was undoubtedly mostly due to the spectacular vocal effects of the \"Mad Scene\" as executed by the original Oph\u00e9lie, [[Christine Nilsson]].<ref name=Forbes24/>\n\n===Act 5===\n''The graveyard near Elsinore.''\n\n'''21. Song of the Gravediggers.''' Two gravediggers are digging a grave (First Gravedigger: ''Dame ou prince, homme ou femme'' &ndash; \"Lady or prince, man or woman\"). '''Hamlet's Theme''' is heard in the orchestra, and he appears in the distance and slowly approaches (both Gravediggers: ''Jeune ou vieux, brune ou blonde'' &ndash; \"Young or old, dark or fair\"). They drink and sing of the pleasures of wine. Hamlet asks for whom the grave is intended. The gravediggers do not remember. (After this shortened version of the gravediggers scene, the action diverges radically from that of the Shakespeare play.)\n\n'''22. Recitative and arioso.''' Hamlet, realizing that Oph\u00e9lie has gone mad, but still unaware that she is dead, begs forgiveness for his ill treatment of her (Hamlet: ''Comme une p\u00e2le fleur'' &ndash; \"Like a delicate flower\").\n\nThe English music critic [[John Steane]], reviewing [[Simon Keenlyside]]'s performance of this aria, wrote:<blockquote>Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and brings out the best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we know from the tenor solos in ''Mignon'', adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.<ref>[[John Steane]], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', September 2003, p. 20.</ref></blockquote>\n\n'''Scene and recitative.''' La\u00ebrte appears in the distance, enveloped in a cape (Hamlet: ''Mais qui marche dans l'ombre? Horatio?'' &ndash; \"Who walks in the shadows? Horatio?\"). Hamlet calls out to him, and La\u00ebrte answers and comes nearer (La\u00ebrte: ''Vous avez fr\u00e9mi, Prince? ... Oui, je suis de retour; c'est moi!'' &ndash; \"Were you afraid, Prince? ... Yes, I have returned; it is I!\"). Knowing of Oph\u00e9lie's death, La\u00ebrte seeks revenge, and challenges Hamlet to a duel. They fight, and Hamlet is wounded.\n\n'''23. Funeral march and chorus.''' A funeral march is heard (Hamlet: ''\u00c9coute! Quel est ce bruit de pas?'' &ndash; \"Listen! What noise is that?\"). He asks La\u00ebrte: \"Who has died?\" La\u00ebrte, in an aside, is amazed that Hamlet still does not know. The funeral procession appears, led by a choir of men and women (Choir: ''Comme la fleur, comme la fleur nouvelle'' &ndash; \"Like a flower, like a fresh flower\"). Oph\u00e9lie's body is carried in; the King and Queen, Polonius, Marcellus, Horatio and the courtiers follow behind.\n\n'''24. Finale.''' Hamlet finally realizes who has died (Hamlet: ''Oph\u00e9lie! ... Morte! glac\u00e9e! \u00d4 crime! Oh! de leurs noirs complots d\u00e9plorable victime!'' &ndash; \"Oph\u00e9lie! ... Dead! Cold! A crime! Oh! Lamentable victim of their black conspiracy!\"). He kneels beside the body of Oph\u00e9lie: \"I have lost you!\" As the grieving Hamlet prepares to kill himself, his father's Ghost appears, visible to everyone. The King cries out \"Mercy!\", and the Ghost responds: \"The hour has passed! You, my son, finish what you have begun!\" Hamlet cries: \"Ah! Strengthen my arm to run him through. Guide my strike!\" He hurls himself upon the King. The King falls. The Queen cries out \"Dieu!\" as the others exclaim: \"The King!\" Hamlet responds: \"No! The murderer! The murderer of my father!\" The Ghost affirms: \"The crime is avenged! The cloister awaits your mother!\" The King dies with the words: ''Je meur maudit!'' &ndash; \"I die accursed!\" The Queen begs God for forgiveness, as the Ghost declares: \"Live for your people, Hamlet! God has made you King.\" Hamlet, in despair, sings: ''Mon \u00e2me est dans la tombe, h\u00e9las! Et je suis Roi!'' &ndash; \"My spirit is in the grave, alas! And I am King!\" Everyone else proclaims: \"Long live Hamlet! Long live the King!\" and the opera ends.\n\n===Alternative endings===\nA shorter version of the Finale, in which Hamlet dies, and the Ghost does not appear, is called \"le d\u00e9nouement du [[Covent Garden Theatre|The\u00e2tre de Covent Garden]]\" (\"the ending for Covent Garden\"). Thomas may have written it in the belief that the English would not accept an adaptation in which Hamlet lives. There is no evidence, however, that it was performed in Thomas's lifetime, either at Covent Garden or anywhere else. It appears in some German vocal scores and is included as an appendix to the recording with [[Thomas Hampson]] as Hamlet.\n\nThere is an additional ending prepared by [[Richard Bonynge]] for a performance in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] in 1982 in which Hamlet dies of his wound suffered in the duel with La\u00ebrte. This ending appears in the recording with [[Sherrill Milnes]] as Hamlet, conducted by Bonynge.<ref name=\"Forbes26\"/>\n\n==Recordings==\n'''Audio'''\n* [[Sherrill Milnes]] (Hamlet); [[Joan Sutherland]] (Oph\u00e9lie); [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]] (Claudius); [[G\u00f6sta Winbergh]] (La\u00ebrte); [[Barbara Smith Conrad|Barbara Conrad]] (Gertrude); [[John Tomlinson (bass)|John Tomlinson]] (Ghost); Keith Lewis (Marcellus); Philip Gelling (Horatio); Arwel Huw Morgan (Polonius); Peyo Garazzi (First Gravedigger); Joseph Rouleau (Second Gravedigger); Orchestra and Chorus of [[Welsh National Opera]]; [[Richard Bonynge]] (conductor).

These roads are remarkable feats of engineering and most were constructed during the British Raj. Ghat roads were built to connect to the famous [[Hill Station]]s established in the mountains for residents to avoid summer heat. They generally served to connect coastal (sea side) areas with the upper region Deccan plateau of the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nThere are many roads in India which can be classed as Ghat Roads.The Indian state of Tamil Nadu has most of the ghat roads.\n\n== Andhra Pradesh ==\nTIRUMALA GHATS\n{{see also|Tirumala ghat roads}}\nThe Ghat roads between [[Tirupati]] and [[Tirumala]] to pilgrim [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]. They are in [[Seshachalam Hills]] range in [[P\u016brva Gha\u1e6d]]\n\nSRISAILAM GHATs\n\nIt is one of the very dangerous ghat road in eastern ghats.

The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their new uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the ''TV numbers'', previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year. The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until [[Les Steckel]] became head coach in 1984; they were the last NFL team to make the change from black to white shoes.

The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their new uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the ''TV numbers'', previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year. The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until [[Les Steckel]] became head coach in 1984; they were the last NFL team to make the change from black to white shoes. In 2006, the team returned to black shoes for first time since the 1983 season.<ref name=\"blog.heritagesportsart.com\">{{cite web |last=Sillcox |first=Scott |url=http://blog.heritagesportsart.com/2010/08/minnesota-vikings-uniform-and-team.html |title=Minnesota Vikings Uniform and Team History &#124; Heritage Uniforms and Jerseys |publisher=Blog.heritagesportsart.com |date=August 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"iml.jou.ufl.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/fall05/brownlee/vikings.html |title=History of NFL Uniforms \u2013 Minnesota Vikings |publisher=Iml.jou.ufl.edu |accessdate=September 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Vikings tweaked their Norseman logo, which involved updating the shading, altering the shape and base of the horns, thickening the mustache and face, making the gold tones brighter, and shortening the braid.

It was released worldwide in January 2016 for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] through the download service [[Steam (software)|Steam]], as well as for [[PlayStation 4]]. The game follows a team of [[astronaut]]s on the first [[Human mission to Mars|manned mission]] to [[Mars]], in order to track down a signal that is apparently extraterrestrial in origin. After being hit by a [[micrometeorite]] storm, they must resort to desperate measures to survive the trip.\n\nA turn-based game played using simulated virtual [[dice]], the player controls four characters, attempting to fix problems with the ship and keep the crew alive each turn by managing their dice cache, [[Health (game terminology)|health]], and stress level. Developed by designer Zach Gage and the indie development studio Choice Provisions, the game was created to mimic a [[board game]] experience.\n\nCritics were polarized on whether the gameplay was deeply strategic or overly dependent on random chance, and the game was more poorly received by video game reviewers than streamers, board game players or other developers.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Tharsis'' allows players to control four astronauts with unique jobs and abilities inside a heavily damaged [[spacecraft]], the Iktomi. The game lasts for 10 in-game weeks, during which time the player must attempt to reach Mars without any of the crew perishing.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2016/2/4/reviews/98343/|title=PC Review \u2013 'Tharsis'|last=Dumlao|first=Brian|date=February 4, 2016|website=Worthplaying|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409070418/http://worthplaying.com/article/2016/2/4/reviews/98343/|archive-date=April 9, 2016|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/tharsis-review-the-exploding-cannabalistic-space-station-always-wins/|title=Tharsis review: The exploding, cannibalistic space station always wins|last=Machkovech|first=Sam|date=January 14, 2016|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412102852/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/tharsis-review-the-exploding-cannabalistic-space-station-always-wins/|archive-date=April 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> At the start of each week, at least two parts of the ship will have a problem in need of repair, and which, if left alone, can damage the ship's hull integrity or crewmember health.

The crew can also eat food, if any, during this time.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Cannibalism]] can be used as a last resort if the crew runs out of food. The player can choose to feed the body of a crew member who died in the beginning of the game to various surviving crew. However, this has significant negative consequences to the characters' stress levels and maximum health, and affects the game's ending.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game is set in the near future, where Earth has received a mysterious signal from [[Tharsis]] on Mars. With scientists believing it to be a sign of [[extraterrestrial life]], the Iktomi is built, and its six crewmembers are sent to Mars to investigate the anomaly.

Cross, and destroys the Pantry where the food is stored. With limited food supplies and crew, disasters start running rampant throughout the ship, and the astronauts are forced to constantly fight to survive. Despite still being able to contact Mission Control, they are unable to turn back home.\n\nDuring the journey, the crew deciphers data sent from Tharsis and realizes that it shows what seems to be an exact copy of the crew of the Iktomi who are in dire straits. Unsure of what to make of this data, they manage to survive until they reach Mars and launch the capsule, while the Iktomi remains in orbit and is destroyed. The crew tracks down the signal and comes across an alien artifact. Suddenly, the artifact flashes with a bright light. If one or more of the Iktomi's crew is dead, the artifact's energy release seemingly kills everyone. One of the crew manages to survive long enough to send a distress call, which the artifact sends back in time, creating a [[causal loop]]. However, if all of the crew survive, then one of the crew members manages to pick up a rock and throw it at the artifact, destroying it in a massive explosion, with their ultimate fate unknown and Mars now covered in a layer of snow, implying the planet can now support human life.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:X is for xylophone (48544194972).jpg|thumb|The color scheme of ''Tharsis'' was based on that of a toy xylophone.|alt=Rainbow-colored toy xylophone]]\nAccording to an interview with Mike Roush, co-founder of Choice Provisions, the original inspiration for ''Tharsis'' was the story of the whaling ship [[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]], which was sunk by a whale, forcing the crew to resort to desperate attempts to stay alive, including cannibalism.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

Tharsis|date=November 17, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idOuWJTev_o|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game was also created out of Choice Provisions's desire not to be \"typecast\" as a studio that only developed the ''[[Bit.Trip]]'' series or worked in an [[8-bit]] [[Retrogaming|retro]] style.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Tharsis's'' art style was based on 70's sci-fi designs such as

resurgence in the popularity of board games, as well as due to the uniqueness of the concept in video games.<ref name=\":0\" /> A challenge that was noted was the high [[learning curve]] of the game, which caused people to abandon it instead of watching the tutorial or delving deeper into the strategic mechanics.<ref name=\":0\" /> The game was balanced to provide a degree of challenge such that players could not beat the game on their first try, but required repeated attempts to be able to get further and further.<ref name=\":0\" /> The game's development took approximately two years to

''Worthplaying'' scored the game moderately, praising the \"lovingly rendered\" graphics of the ship despite the \"generic\" characters, and saying the music was \"done very well\", though mentioning that the game was \"not for everyone\", and that people who weren't comfortable with losing far more often than they would win would be unhappy with the game.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA common point of criticism was that success was perceived to be overly based on random chance. Patrick Hancock of ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the game's graphics as \"wonderful\", aside from the faces of the crew members, but criticized the game for relying \"too much on dice rolls\", leading to the feeling that winning is too dependent on luck and \"destroy[ing] one's interest in trying again\".<ref name=\":7\" /> Rob Zacny of ''[[IGN]]'' stated that he felt that he had gotten \"lucky\" when things went well, instead of doing \"something clever\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review|title=Tharsis Review|last=Zacny|first=Rob|date=May 2, 2017|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703211149/https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review|archive-date=July 3, 2019|access-date=}}</ref> Tyler Wilde of ''PC Gamer'' called the game it highly \"dependent on chance\", and suggested that the difficulty varies widely depending on how good your dice rolls are for that particular playthrough.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAccording to designer [[Zach Gage]], the game was one of the most critically divisive he ever worked on.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/27/10840688/tharsis-random-chance-love-it-hate-it|title=Death is random, but so is survival: Learning to love random chance in Tharsis|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|date=January 27, 2016|website=Polygon|language=en-US|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825234038/http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/27/10840688/tharsis-random-chance-love-it-hate-it|archive-date=August 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The game received an overall negative response from publications that were video game focused, while it received a more positive response from streamers, board game players, and developers.<ref name=\":1\" /> He believes this is due to the fact that games of chance are usually used as a lazy shortcut to make things harder, or to take the player's money in [[mobile game]]s, which caused the gameplay of ''Tharsis'' to be overlooked.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://totallychoice.com/games/tharsis Official website]\n\n{{Zach Gage}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Science fiction video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Turn-based strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Choice Provisions games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games set on Mars]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{short description|2016 strategy video game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Tharsis\n| image = File:Tharsis_Cover_Art.jpg\n| caption = \n| developer = [[Choice Provisions]]\n| publisher = Choice Provisions\n| designer = [[Zach Gage]]\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = {{ubl|[[Windows]]|[[Mac OS X]]|[[PlayStation 4]]}}\n| released = {{vgrelease|WW|January 12, 2016}}\n| genre = [[strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes = [[Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''Tharsis''''' is a 2016 [[strategy video game]] developed and published by [[Choice Provisions]].

Cross, and destroys the Pantry where the food is stored. With limited food supplies and crew, disasters start running rampant throughout the ship, and the astronauts are forced to constantly fight to survive. Despite still being able to contact Mission Control, they are unable to turn back home.\n\nDuring the journey, the crew deciphers data sent from Tharsis and realizes that it shows what seems to be an exact copy of the crew of the Iktomi who are in dire straits. Unsure of what to make of this data, they manage to survive until they reach Mars and launch the capsule, while the Iktomi remains in orbit and is destroyed. The crew tracks down the signal and comes across an alien artifact. Suddenly, the artifact flashes with a bright light. If one or more of the Iktomi's crew is dead, the artifact's energy release seemingly kills everyone. One of the crew manages to survive long enough to send a distress call, which the artifact sends back in time, creating a [[causal loop]]. However, if all of the crew survive, then one of the crew members manages to pick up a rock and throw it at the artifact, destroying it in a massive explosion, with their ultimate fate unknown and Mars now covered in a layer of snow, implying the planet can now support human life.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:X is for xylophone (48544194972).jpg|thumb|The color scheme of ''Tharsis'' was based on that of a toy xylophone.|alt=Rainbow-colored toy xylophone]]\nAccording to an interview with Mike Roush, co-founder of Choice Provisions, the original inspiration for ''Tharsis'' was the story of

criticism was that success was percieved to be overly based on random chance. Patrick Hancock of ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised the game's graphics as \"wonderful\", aside from the faces of the crew members, but criticized the game for relying \"too much on dice rolls\", leading to the feeling that winning is too dependent on luck and \"destroy[ing] one's interest in trying again\".<ref name=\":7\" /> Rob Zacny of ''[[IGN]]'' stated that he felt that he had gotten \"lucky\" when things went well, instead of doing \"something clever\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review|title=Tharsis Review|last=Zacny|first=Rob|date=May 2, 2017|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703211149/https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review|archive-date=July 3, 2019|access-date=}}</ref> Tyler Wilde of ''PC Gamer'' called the game it highly \"dependent on chance\", and suggested that the difficulty varies widely depending on how good your dice rolls are for that particular playthrough.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nAccording to designer [[Zach Gage]], the game was one of the most critically divisive he ever worked on.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/27/10840688/tharsis-random-chance-love-it-hate-it|title=Death is random, but so is survival: Learning to love random chance in Tharsis|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|date=January 27, 2016|website=Polygon|language=en-US|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825234038/http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/27/10840688/tharsis-random-chance-love-it-hate-it|archive-date=August 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The game received an overall negative response from publications that were video game focused, while it received a more positive response from streamers, board game players, and developers.<ref name=\":1\" /> He believes this is due to the fact that games of chance are usually used as a lazy shortcut to make things harder, or to take the player's money in [[mobile game]]s, which caused the gameplay of ''Tharsis'' to be overlooked.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://totallychoice.com/games/tharsis Official website]\n\n{{Zach Gage}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Science fiction video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Turn-based strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Choice Provisions games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games set on Mars]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception:Typo fixing, replaced: percieved \u2192 perceived", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharsis_(video_game)"}

Many villagers commute daily to nearby Shimoga city.\n\nAbbalgere was once known for tobacco production. The Central Tobacco market yard operated in the village for many years. However, in 2006-2007 former PM and MP of Hassan, H. D. Deve Gowda (member of the Central Tobacco board) shifted the market to his own district Hassan (Ramanathapuram).
