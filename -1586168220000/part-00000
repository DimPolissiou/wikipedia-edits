He made the state singles finals three straight years, winning as a senior.\n\nPurcell graduated [[Murray High School (Kentucky)|Murray High School]] and went on to Memphis State University (now the [[University of Memphis]]), where he played for one year. He transferred to the [[University of Tennessee]], where in 1980 he won an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] doubles championship with teammate [[Rodney Harmon]].\n\n==Pro career==\nPurcell made his debut on the professional circuit in the summer of 1980. As a wild card entrant at the Washington (D.C.) Star Tournament, he upset top-ranked [[Eddie Dibbs]]. Two weeks later, he qualified for a spot in the U.S. Clay Courts, where he beat [[Hank Pfister]] and top-10 ranked [[Harold Solomon]] before falling in the finals to [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]].

The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847.\n\n==Background==\nWhen war was declared on May 13, 1846 between the United States and Mexico, it took almost three months for definitive word of Congress' declaration of war to reach the Pacific coast. U.S. consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]], stationed in the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], was concerned about the increasing possibility of war and worked to prevent bloodshed between the Americans and the small Mexican military garrison at the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]], commanded by [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]]. \n\nUnited States Army Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], on a survey expedition of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] with about 60 well-armed men, crossed the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in December 1845. They had reached the [[Oregon Territory]] by May 1846, when Fr\u00e9mont received word that war between Mexico and the U.S. was imminent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/fremont.html | title=Captain John Charles Fremont and the Bear Flag Revolt}}</ref>\n\n===Bear Flag Revolt===\n{{Main|Bear Flag Revolt}}\n[[File:Original Todd bear flag.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A replica of the first \"Bear Flag\" now at El Presidio de Sonoma (Sonoma Barracks)]]\nOn June 14, 1846, the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] occurred when some 30 rebels, mostly American immigrants, staged a revolt in response to government threats of expulsion and seized the small Mexican [[Sonoma Barracks]] garrison, in the pueblo of [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] north of [[San Francisco Bay]]. There they formed the [[California Republic]], created the \"[[Bear Flag]]\", and raised it over Sonoma. Eleven days later, troops led by Fr\u00e9mont, who had acted on his own authority, arrived from [[Sutter's Fort]] to support the rebels. No government was ever organized, but the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] has become part of the state's folklore. The present-day [[California state flag]] is based on this original Bear Flag, and continues to display the words \"California Republic.\"\n\n==Northern Alta California==\nPrior to the Mexican\u2013American War, preparations for a possible conflict led to the U.S. [[Pacific Squadron]] being extensively reinforced until it had roughly half of the ships in the [[United States Navy]]. Since it took 120 to over 200 days to sail from Atlantic ports on the east coast, around [[Cape Horn]], to the Pacific ports in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] and then the [[West Coast of the United States|mainland west coast]], these movements had to be made well in advance of any possible conflict to be effective. Initially, with no United States ports in the Pacific, the squadron's ships operated out of storeships that provided naval supplies, purchased food and obtained water from local ports of call in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] and on the Pacific coast. Their orders were, upon determining \"beyond a doubt\" that war had been declared, to capture the ports and cities of Alta California.  \n\nCommodore [[John Drake Sloat]], commander of the Pacific Squadron, on being informed of an outbreak of hostilities between Mexico and the United States, as well as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] in Sonoma, ordered his naval forces to occupy ports in northern Alta California. Sloat's ships already in the Monterey harbor, the {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}}, {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}}, and {{USS|Levant|1837|6}}, captured the Alta Californian capital city of Monterey in the \"[[Battle of Monterey]]\" on July 7, 1846 without firing a shot. Two days later on July 9, {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}, which had been berthed at [[Sausalito]], captured [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (present-day San Francisco) in the \"[[Battle of Yerba Buena]]\", again without firing a shot. On July 15, Sloat transferred his command to Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]], a much more aggressive leader. Convincing news of a state of war between the U.S. and Mexico had previously reached Stockton. The 400 to 650 [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] and bluejackets (sailors) of Stockton's Pacific Squadron were the largest U.S. ground force in California. The rest of Stockton's men were needed to man his vessels.\n\nTo supplement this remaining force, Commodore Stockton ordered Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], on the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers survey, to secure 100 volunteers (he received 160) in addition to the [[California Battalion]] he had earlier organized. They were to act primarily as occupation forces to free up Stockton's marines and sailors. The core of the California Battalion was the approximately 30 army personnel and 30 scouts, guards, ex-fur trappers, Indians, geographers, [[topographer]]s and [[Cartography|cartographers]] in Fr\u00e9mont's exploration force, which was joined by about 150 Bear Flaggers. \n\nThe American marines, sailors, and militia easily took over the cities and ports of northern California; within days they controlled [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], [[Sutter's Fort]], [[Sacramento, California|New Helvetia]], and other small pueblos in northern Alta California. Nearly all were occupied without a shot being fired. Some of the southern pueblos and ports were also rapidly occupied, with almost no bloodshed.\n\n==Southern Alta California==\n===Californios and the war===\nPrior to the U.S. occupation, the population of Spanish and Mexican people in Alta California was approximately 1500 men and 6500 women and children, who were known as ''[[Californio]]s''. Many lived in or near the small [[Pueblo of Los Angeles]] (present-day [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Castelo|first=Eugene|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Californians_Before_the_Gold_Rush.html?id=DWUGjwEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description|title=Californians Before the Gold Rush|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2015|isbn=9781519476975|location=|pages=Overview}}</ref> Many other Californios lived on the 455 [[Ranchos of California|ranchos of Alta California]], which contained slightly more than {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}}, nearly all bestowed by the Spanish and then Mexican governors with an average of about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMost of the approximately 800 American and other immigrants (primarily adult males) lived in the northern half of California, approved of breaking from the Mexican government, and gave only token to no resistance to the forces of Stockton and Fr\u00e9mont.<ref>Theodore Henry Hittell, ''History of California'' Vol. 2 (1885) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tkYOAAAAIAAJ online]</ref>\n\n===Siege of Los Angeles===\n{{Main|Siege of Los Angeles}}\nIn Southern California, Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] and Alta California Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] fled the [[Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles|Pueblo of Los Angeles]] before the arrival of American forces. On August 13, 1846, when Stockton's forces entered Los Angeles with no resistance, the nearly bloodless conquest of California seemed complete. The force of 36 that Stockton left in Los Angeles, however, was too small and, in addition, enforced a tyrannical control of the citizenry. On September 29, in the [[Siege of Los Angeles]], the independent [[Californio]]s, under the leadership of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]], forced the small American garrison to retire to the harbor.\n\nSoon afterward, 200 reinforcements sent by Stockton and led by U.S. Navy Captain William Mervine were repulsed on October 8 in the one-hour [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho]] on [[Rancho San Pedro]], with four Americans killed. In late November, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]], with a squadron of 100 dragoons, finally reached the [[Colorado River]] at the present-day California border after a grueling march across the province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] and the [[Sonoran Desert]]. Then, on December 6, they fought the botched half-hour [[Battle of San Pasqual]]<ref name=\"auto\">Walker p. 215-219</ref> east of San Diego pueblo, where 21 of Kearny's troops were killed, the largest number of American casualties in the battles of the California Campaign.\n\n===Final conquest===\nStockton rescued Kearny's surrounded forces and, with their combined force totaling 660 troops, they moved northward from [[San Diego]], entering the [[Los Angeles Basin]] on January 8, 1847. On that day they fought the [[Californios]] in the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel]] and the next day in the [[Battle of La Mesa]]. The last significant body of [[Californios]] surrendered to American forces on January 12, marking the end of the war in Alta California.\n\n==After the California Campaign==\n===Treaty of Cahuenga===\nThe [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. The treaty was drafted in English and Spanish by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo]] and approved by American Lieutenant-Colonel [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and [[List of pre-statehood governors of California|Mexican Governor]] [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]] at [[Campo de Cahuenga]] in the [[Cahuenga Pass]] of Los Angeles. It was later ratified by Fr\u00e9mont's superiors, Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] and General [[Stephen W. Kearny|Stephen Kearny]] (brevet rank).\n\n===Pacific Coast Campaign===\n====California Reinforcements====\nIn July 1846, Colonel [[Jonathan D. Stevenson]] of New York was asked to raise a volunteer regiment of ten companies of 77 men each to go to California with the understanding that they would muster out and stay in California. They were designated the [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]] and took part in the [[Pacific Coast Campaign]]. In August and September 1846 the regiment trained and prepared for the trip to California. \n\nThree private merchant ships, ''Thomas H Perkins'', ''Loo Choo'', and ''Susan Drew'', were chartered, and the sloop {{USS|Preble|1839|6}} was assigned convoy detail. On September 26 the four ships sailed for California. Fifty men who had been left behind for various reasons sailed on November 13, 1846 on the small storeship [[USS Brutus|USS ''Brutus'']]. The ''Susan Drew'' and ''Loo Choo'' reached [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile by January 20, 1847 and they were on their way again by January 23. The ''Perkins'' did not stop until San Francisco, reaching port on March 6, 1847. The ''Susan Drew'' arrived on March 20 and the ''Loo Choo'' arrived on March 26, 1847, 183 days after leaving New York. The ''Brutus'' finally arrived on April 17.\n\nAfter desertions and deaths in transit the four ships brought 648 men to California. The companies were then deployed throughout Upper Alta California and Lower Baja California on the [[Baja California Peninsula]] (captured by the Navy and later returned to Mexico), from San Francisco to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]]. The ship ''Isabella '' sailed from [[Philadelphia]] on August 16, 1846, with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, and arrived in California on February 18, 1847 at about the same time that the ship ''Sweden'' arrived with another detachment of soldiers.

The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847.\n\n==Background==\nWhen war was declared on May 13, 1846 between the United States and Mexico, it took almost three months for definitive word of Congress' declaration of war to reach the Pacific coast. U.S. consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]], stationed in the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], was concerned about the increasing possibility of war and worked to prevent bloodshed between the Americans and the small Mexican military garrison at the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]], commanded by [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]]. \n\nUnited States Army Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], on a survey expedition of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] with about 60 well-armed men, crossed the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in December 1845. They had reached the [[Oregon Territory]] by May 1846, when Fr\u00e9mont received word that war between Mexico and the U.S. was imminent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/fremont.html | title=Captain John Charles Fremont and the Bear Flag Revolt}}</ref>\n\n===Bear Flag Revolt===\n{{Main|Bear Flag Revolt}}\n[[File:Original Todd bear flag.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A replica of the first \"Bear Flag\" now at El Presidio de Sonoma (Sonoma Barracks)]]\nOn June 14, 1846, the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] occurred when some 30 rebels, mostly American immigrants, staged a revolt in response to government threats of expulsion and seized the small Mexican [[Sonoma Barracks]] garrison, in the pueblo of [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] north of [[San Francisco Bay]]. There they formed the [[California Republic]], created the \"[[Bear Flag]]\", and raised it over Sonoma. Eleven days later, troops led by Fr\u00e9mont, who had acted on his own authority, arrived from [[Sutter's Fort]] to support the rebels. No government was ever organized, but the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] has become part of the state's folklore. The present-day [[California state flag]] is based on this original Bear Flag, and continues to display the words \"California Republic.\"\n\n==Northern Alta California==\nPrior to the Mexican\u2013American War, preparations for a possible conflict led to the U.S. [[Pacific Squadron]] being extensively reinforced until it had roughly half of the ships in the [[United States Navy]]. Since it took 120 to over 200 days to sail from Atlantic ports on the east coast, around [[Cape Horn]], to the Pacific ports in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] and then the [[West Coast of the United States|mainland west coast]], these movements had to be made well in advance of any possible conflict to be effective. Initially, with no United States ports in the Pacific, the squadron's ships operated out of storeships that provided naval supplies, purchased food and obtained water from local ports of call in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] and on the Pacific coast. Their orders were, upon determining \"beyond a doubt\" that war had been declared, to capture the ports and cities of Alta California.  \n\nCommodore [[John Drake Sloat]], commander of the Pacific Squadron, on being informed of an outbreak of hostilities between Mexico and the United States, as well as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] in Sonoma, ordered his naval forces to occupy ports in northern Alta California. Sloat's ships already in the Monterey harbor, the {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}}, {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}}, and {{USS|Levant|1837|6}}, captured the Alta Californian capital city of Monterey in the \"[[Battle of Monterey]]\" on July 7, 1846 without firing a shot. Two days later on July 9, {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}, which had been berthed at [[Sausalito]], captured [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (present-day San Francisco) in the \"[[Battle of Yerba Buena]]\", again without firing a shot. On July 15, Sloat transferred his command to Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]], a much more aggressive leader. Convincing news of a state of war between the U.S. and Mexico had previously reached Stockton. The 400 to 650 [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] and bluejackets (sailors) of Stockton's Pacific Squadron were the largest U.S. ground force in California. The rest of Stockton's men were needed to man his vessels.\n\nTo supplement this remaining force, Commodore Stockton ordered Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], on the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers survey, to secure 100 volunteers (he received 160) in addition to the [[California Battalion]] he had earlier organized. They were to act primarily as occupation forces to free up Stockton's marines and sailors. The core of the California Battalion was the approximately 30 army personnel and 30 scouts, guards, ex-fur trappers, Indians, geographers, [[topographer]]s and [[Cartography|cartographers]] in Fr\u00e9mont's exploration force, which was joined by about 150 Bear Flaggers. \n\nThe American marines, sailors, and militia easily took over the cities and ports of northern California; within days they controlled [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], [[Sutter's Fort]], [[Sacramento, California|New Helvetia]], and other small pueblos in northern Alta California. Nearly all were occupied without a shot being fired. Some of the southern pueblos and ports were also rapidly occupied, with almost no bloodshed.\n\n==Southern Alta California==\n===Californios and the war===\nPrior to the U.S. occupation, the population of Spanish and Mexican people in Alta California was approximately 1500 men and 6500 women and children, who were known as ''[[Californio]]s''. Many lived in or near the small [[Pueblo of Los Angeles]] (present-day [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Many other Californios lived on the 455 [[Ranchos of California|ranchos of Alta California]], which contained slightly more than {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}}, nearly all bestowed by the Spanish and then Mexican governors with an average of about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMost of the approximately 800 American and other immigrants (primarily adult males) lived in the northern half of California, approved of breaking from the Mexican government, and gave only token to no resistance to the forces of Stockton and Fr\u00e9mont.<ref>Theodore Henry Hittell, ''History of California'' Vol. 2 (1885) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tkYOAAAAIAAJ online]</ref>\n\n===Siege of Los Angeles===\n{{Main|Siege of Los Angeles}}\nIn Southern California, Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] and Alta California Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] fled the [[Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles|Pueblo of Los Angeles]] before the arrival of American forces. On August 13, 1846, when Stockton's forces entered Los Angeles with no resistance, the nearly bloodless conquest of California seemed complete. The force of 36 that Stockton left in Los Angeles, however, was too small and, in addition, enforced a tyrannical control of the citizenry. On September 29, in the [[Siege of Los Angeles]], the independent [[Californio]]s, under the leadership of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]], forced the small American garrison to retire to the harbor.\n\nSoon afterward, 200 reinforcements sent by Stockton and led by U.S. Navy Captain William Mervine were repulsed on October 8 in the one-hour [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho]] on [[Rancho San Pedro]], with four Americans killed. In late November, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]], with a squadron of 100 dragoons, finally reached the [[Colorado River]] at the present-day California border after a grueling march across the province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] and the [[Sonoran Desert]]. Then, on December 6, they fought the botched half-hour [[Battle of San Pasqual]]<ref name=\"auto\">Walker p. 215-219</ref> east of San Diego pueblo, where 21 of Kearny's troops were killed, the largest number of American casualties in the battles of the California Campaign.\n\n===Final conquest===\nStockton rescued Kearny's surrounded forces and, with their combined force totaling 660 troops, they moved northward from [[San Diego]], entering the [[Los Angeles Basin]] on January 8, 1847. On that day they fought the [[Californios]] in the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel]] and the next day in the [[Battle of La Mesa]]. The last significant body of [[Californios]] surrendered to American forces on January 12, marking the end of the war in Alta California.\n\n==After the California Campaign==\n===Treaty of Cahuenga===\nThe [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. The treaty was drafted in English and Spanish by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo]] and approved by American Lieutenant-Colonel [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and [[List of pre-statehood governors of California|Mexican Governor]] [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]] at [[Campo de Cahuenga]] in the [[Cahuenga Pass]] of Los Angeles. It was later ratified by Fr\u00e9mont's superiors, Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] and General [[Stephen W. Kearny|Stephen Kearny]] (brevet rank).\n\n===Pacific Coast Campaign===\n====California Reinforcements====\nIn July 1846, Colonel [[Jonathan D. Stevenson]] of New York was asked to raise a volunteer regiment of ten companies of 77 men each to go to California with the understanding that they would muster out and stay in California. They were designated the [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]] and took part in the [[Pacific Coast Campaign]]. In August and September 1846 the regiment trained and prepared for the trip to California. \n\nThree private merchant ships, ''Thomas H Perkins'', ''Loo Choo'', and ''Susan Drew'', were chartered, and the sloop {{USS|Preble|1839|6}} was assigned convoy detail. On September 26 the four ships sailed for California. Fifty men who had been left behind for various reasons sailed on November 13, 1846 on the small storeship [[USS Brutus|USS ''Brutus'']]. The ''Susan Drew'' and ''Loo Choo'' reached [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile by January 20, 1847 and they were on their way again by January 23. The ''Perkins'' did not stop until San Francisco, reaching port on March 6, 1847. The ''Susan Drew'' arrived on March 20 and the ''Loo Choo'' arrived on March 26, 1847, 183 days after leaving New York. The ''Brutus'' finally arrived on April 17.\n\nAfter desertions and deaths in transit the four ships brought 648 men to California. The companies were then deployed throughout Upper Alta California and Lower Baja California on the [[Baja California Peninsula]] (captured by the Navy and later returned to Mexico), from San Francisco to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]]. The ship ''Isabella '' sailed from [[Philadelphia]] on August 16, 1846, with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, and arrived in California on February 18, 1847 at about the same time that the ship ''Sweden'' arrived with another detachment of soldiers. These soldiers were added to the existing companies of Stevenson's 1st New York Volunteer Regiment.<ref>Seventy-five Years in San Francisco; Appendix L [http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hb75yap4.htm] Accessed 18 Mar 2009</ref> These troops essentially took over nearly all of the Pacific Squadron's onshore military and [[garrison]] duties and the [[California Battalion]]'s garrison duties.\n\nIn January 1847, Lieutenant [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and about 100 regular U.S. Army soldiers arrived in Monterey. American forces in the pipeline continued to dribble into California.\n\n====Mormon Battalion====\n{{Main|Mormon Battalion}}\nThe [[Mormon Battalion]] served from July 1846 to July 1847 during the Mexican\u2013American War.

During its service, the battalion made a grueling march of some 1,900 miles from [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] to [[San Diego]]. This remains one of the longest single military marches in U.S. history.\n\nThe Mormon Battalion arrived in San Diego on January 29, 1847. For the next five months until their discharge on July 16, 1847 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the battalion trained and did garrison duties in several locations in [[southern California]]. Discharged members of the Mormon Battalion were helping to build a sawmill for [[John Sutter]] when gold was discovered there in January 1848, starting the [[California Gold Rush]].\n\n===Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo===\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed in February 1848, marked the end of the Mexican\u2013American War. By the terms of the treaty, Mexico formally ceded Alta California along with its other northern territories east through [[Texas]], receiving [[USD|$]]15,000,000 in exchange. This largely unsettled territory constituted nearly half of its claimed territory with about 1% of its then population of about 4,500,000.<ref>Note: A new international boundary was drawn; [[San Diego Bay]] is one of the only two main natural harbors in California south of [[San Francisco Bay]];  the border was aligned from one Spanish league south of San Diego Bay east to the [[Gila River]] \u2013 [[Colorado River]] confluence, to include strategic San Diego and its harbor.</ref><ref>Two years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, U.S. statehood was granted in 1850.</ref>\n\n==Timeline of events==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:87%; border:1; cellpadding:5; cellspacing:0;\"\n|style=\"background: #F0E68C\" |'''Date'''||style=\"background: #F0E68C\" |'''Events surrounding the United States' conquest of California'''\n<onlyinclude>\n|-\n|width=\"80pt\"|Summer 1841||John C.
