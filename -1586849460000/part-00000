Young Metro!\" ([[Future (rapper)|Future]]), \"Ayy Lil Metro on that beat\" ([[Kodak Black]]), \"Metro be boomin!\" ([[Rich the Kid]]), and rarely \"This beat is so, so Metro\", a tag recorded with his voice at some point in 2009.

A [[health care provider]] may ask a patient to [[consent]] to receive [[therapy]] before providing it, or a [[clinical research]]er may ask a [[research participant]] before enrolling that person into a [[clinical trial]]. Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of [[medical ethics]] and [[research ethics]].\n\nAn informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. Adequate informed consent is rooted in respecting a person's dignity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elsayyad|first=Ahmed|title=Informed Consent for Comparative Effectiveness Trials|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=20|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1403310|pages=1958\u20131960|year=2014}}</ref> To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) or a severe [[intellectual disability]], severe [[mental disorder]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], severe [[sleep deprivation]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or being in a [[coma]].\n\nObtaining informed consent is [[#Waiver of requirement|not always required]]. If an individual is considered unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on his behalf, e.g., parents or [[legal guardian]]s of a child (though in this circumstance the child may be required to provide [[informed assent]]) and conservators for the [[mentally disordered]], or consent can be assumed through the doctrine of [[implied consent]], e.g., when an unconscious person will die without immediate medical treatment.\n\nIn cases where an individual is provided insufficient information to form a reasoned decision, serious ethical issues arise. Such cases in a [[clinical trial]] in [[medical research]] are anticipated and prevented by an [[ethics committee]] or [[Institutional Review Board]].\n\nInformed Consent Form (ICF) templates can be found on the World Health Organization Website for practical use.<ref name=\"who\">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/ethics/review-committee/informed_consent/en/|title=Templates for informed consent forms|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n\nInformed consent can be complex to evaluate, because neither expressions of consent, nor expressions of understanding of implications, necessarily mean that full adult consent was in fact given, nor that full comprehension of relevant issues is internally digested. Consent may be implied within the usual subtleties of human communication, rather than explicitly negotiated verbally or in writing. In some cases consent cannot legally be possible, even if the person protests he does indeed understand and wish. There are also structured instruments for evaluating capacity to give informed consent, although no ideal instrument presently exists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThus, there is always a degree to which informed consent must be assumed or inferred based upon observation, or knowledge, or legal reliance. This especially is the case in sexual or relational issues. In medical or formal circumstances, explicit agreement by means of signature\u2014normally relied on legally\u2014regardless of actual consent, is the norm. This is the case with certain procedures, such as a \"[[do not resuscitate]]\" directive that a patient signed before onset of their illness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBrief examples of each of the above:\n# A person may verbally agree to something from fear, perceived social pressure, or psychological difficulty in asserting true feelings. The person requesting the action may honestly be unaware of this and believe the consent is genuine, and rely on it. ''Consent is expressed, but not internally given.''\n# A person may claim to understand the implications of some action, as part of consent, but in fact has failed to appreciate the possible consequences fully and may later deny the validity of the consent for this reason. ''Understanding needed for informed consent is present but is, in fact (through ignorance), not present.''\n# A person signs a [[legal release]] form for a [[medical procedure]], and later feels he did not really consent. Unless he can show actual misinformation, the release is usually persuasive or conclusive in law, in that the clinician may rely legally upon it for consent. ''In formal circumstances, a written consent usually legally overrides later denial of informed consent (unless obtained by misrepresentation)''.\n# Informed consent in the U.S. can be overridden in emergency medical situations pursuant to [[21CFR50.24]], which was first brought to the general public's attention via the controversy surrounding the study of [[Polyheme]].\n\n==Valid elements==\n\nFor an individual to give valid informed consent, three components must be present: disclosure, capacity and voluntariness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Faden |first=R.

The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.\n\n===Requirements of the professional===\nUntil 2015 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], informed consent in medical procedures requires proof as to the standard of care to expect as a recognised standard of acceptable professional practice (the [[Bolam Test]]), that is, what risks would a medical professional usually disclose in the circumstances (see [[Loss of right in English law]]). Arguably, this is \"sufficient consent\" rather than \"informed consent.\" The UK has since departed from the Bolam test for judging standards of informed consent, due to the landmark ruling in ''[[Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board]]''. This moves away from the concept of a reasonable physician and instead uses the standard of a [[Reasonable person|reasonable patient]], and what risks an individual would attach significance to.\n\nMedicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada also takes this patient-centric approach to \"informed consent.\" Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient. This approach combines an objective (a hypothetical reasonable patient) and subjective (this particular patient) approach.\n\nThe doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to [[assault (tort)|assault]] or [[battery (tort)|battery]]. The consent standard here is only that the person understands, in general terms, the nature of and purpose of the intended intervention. As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out. Significantly, causation must be shown: That had the individual been made aware of the risk he would not have proceeded with the operation (or perhaps with that surgeon).\n\nOptimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on the context of the delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who is saying it and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than ''what'' is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical \"Western\" countries.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/746187?src=mp&spon=25 Too Much Information: Informed Consent in Cultural Context]. By Joseph J. Fins and Pablo Rodriguez del Pozo. Medscape 07/18/2011</ref>\n\nThe informed consent doctrine is generally implemented through good healthcare practice: pre-operation discussions with patients and the use of medical consent forms in hospitals. However, reliance on a signed form should not undermine the basis of the doctrine in giving the patient an opportunity to weigh and respond to the risk. In one British case, a doctor performing routine surgery on a woman noticed that she had cancerous tissue in her womb. He took the initiative to remove the woman's womb; however, as she had not given informed consent for this operation, the doctor was judged by the [[General Medical Council]] to have acted negligently. The council stated that the woman should have been informed of her condition, and allowed to make her own decision.\n\n===Obtaining informed consents===\n\nTo capture and manage informed consents, hospital management systems typically use paper-based consent forms which are scanned and stored in a document handling system after obtaining the necessary signatures. Hospital systems and research organizations are adopting an electronic way of capturing informed consents to enable indexing, to improve comprehension, search and retrieval of consent data, thus enhancing the ability to honor to patient intent and identify willing research participants.<ref name=\"healthsciencessc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|title=Health Sciences South Carolina|publisher=healthsciencessc.org|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011200835/http://healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|archivedate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chalil Madathil | first1 = K. | last2 = Koikkara | first2 = R. | last3 = Gramopadhye | first3 = A.

In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a [[health care proxy]] makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.\n\nBy contrast, '[[Minor (law)|minors]]' (which may be defined differently in different jurisdictions) are generally presumed incompetent to consent, but depending on their age and other factors may be required to provide [[Informed assent]]. In some jurisdictions (e.g. much of the U.S.), this is a strict standard. In other jurisdictions (e.g. England, Australia, Canada), this presumption may be rebutted through proof that the minor is \u2018mature\u2019 (the \u2018[[Gillick competence|Gillick standard]]\u2019). In cases of incompetent minors, informed consent is usually required from the parent (rather than the 'best interests standard') although a [[parens patriae]] order may apply, allowing the court to dispense with parental consent in cases of refusal.\n\n===Deception===\n\nResearch involving deception is controversial given the requirement for informed consent. Deception typically arises in social psychology, when researching a particular psychological process requires that investigators deceive subjects. For example, in the [[Milgram experiment]], researchers wanted to determine the willingness of participants to obey authority figures despite their personal conscientious objections. They had authority figures demand that participants deliver what they thought was an electric shock to another research participant. For the study to succeed, it was necessary to deceive the participants so they believed that the subject was a peer and that their electric shocks caused the peer actual pain.\n\nNonetheless, research involving deception prevents subjects from exercising their basic right of autonomous informed decision-making and conflicts with the ethical principle of [[respect for persons]].\n\nThe [[Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct]] set by the [[American Psychological Association]] says that psychologists may conduct research that includes a deceptive compartment only if they can both justify the act by the value and importance of the study's results and show they could not obtain the results by some other way. Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, either physical pain or [[emotional distress]]. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session in which the experimenter both tells the subject about the deception and gives subject the option of withdrawing the data.<ref>{{cite web|last=2.

Other countries with such laws (e.g. [[Germany]]) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taupitz |first1=Jochen |last2=Weschka |first2=Marion |date=2009 |title=CHIMBRIDS - Chimeras and Hybrids in Comparative European and International Research: Scientific, Ethical, Philosophical and Legal Aspects.

This \"consent by proxy\" usually works reasonably well, but can lead to ethical dilemmas when the judgment of the parents or guardians and the medical professional differ with regard to what constitutes appropriate decisions \"in the best interest of the child\". Children who are [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]], and certain situations such as decisions regarding sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy, or for unemancipated minors who are deemed to have medical decision making capacity, may be able to provide consent without the need for parental permission depending on the laws of the jurisdiction the child lives in. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] encourages medical professionals also to seek the assent of older children and adolescents by providing age appropriate information to these children to help empower them in the decision making process.<ref name=\"AAP\">{{cite journal | author = Committee on Bioethics  | year = 1995 | title = Informed consent, parental permission, and assent in pediatric practice | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/95/2/314.full.pdf | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 2| pages = 314\u20137 | pmid = 7838658 }}</ref>\n\nResearch on children has benefited society in many ways. The only effective way to establish normal patterns of growth and metabolism is to do research on infants and young children. When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent. This is valid, although only legal guardians are able to consent for a child, not adult siblings.<ref name=\"Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63\u201393\">{{cite book|last=Annas, Glantz, Katz|first=George, Leonard, Barbara|title=Informed Consent to Human Experimentation|year=1977|publisher=Ballinger Publishing Company|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-88410-147-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/informedconsentt0000anna/page/63 63\u201393]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/informedconsentt0000anna/page/63}}</ref>  Additionally, parents may not order the termination of a treatment that is required to keep a child alive, even if they feel it is in the best interest.<ref name=\"Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63\u201393\"/>  Guardians are typically involved in the consent of children, however a number of doctrines have developed that allow children to receive health treatments without parental consent.

Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf |title=Guideline For Good Clinical Practice |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}</ref>\nIn [[medical research]], the [[Nuremberg Code]] set a base international standard in 1947, which continued to develop, for example in response to the ethical violation in the [[Holocaust]]. Nowadays, medical research is overseen by an [[ethics committee]] that also oversees the informed consent process.\n\nAs the medical guidelines established in the Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the [[social science]]s, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Homan |first=R. |year=1991 |title=The Ethics of Social Research |location=London; New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0-582-05879-8 }}</ref> However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, it is not always required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the [[Hawthorne Effect]]: \"In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=S.

This issue came to the public light following a study conducted by [[Facebook|Facebook Inc.]] in 2014, and published by that company and [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|last2=Guillory|first2=Jaime|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Hancock|title=Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks|journal=PNAS|date=2014|volume=111|issue=24|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320040111|pmid=24889601|pages=8788\u201390|pmc=4066473}}</ref> Facebook conducted a study where they altered the Facebook News Feeds of roughly 700,000 users to reduce either the amount of positive or negative posts they saw for a week.

A [[health care provider]] may ask a patient to [[consent]] to receive [[therapy]] before providing it, or a [[clinical research]]er may ask a [[research participant]] before enrolling that person into a [[clinical trial]]. Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of [[medical ethics]] and [[research ethics]].\n\nAn informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. Adequate informed consent is rooted in respecting a person's dignity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elsayyad|first=Ahmed|title=Informed Consent for Comparative Effectiveness Trials|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=20|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1403310|pages=1958\u20131960|year=2014}}</ref> To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) or a severe [[intellectual disability]], severe [[mental disorder]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], severe [[sleep deprivation]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or being in a [[coma]].\n\nObtaining informed consent is [[#Waiver of requirement|not always required]]. If an individual is considered unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on his behalf, e.g., parents or [[legal guardian]]s of a child (though in this circumstance the child may be required to provide [[informed assent]]) and conservators for the [[mentally disordered]], or consent can be assumed through the doctrine of [[implied consent]], e.g., when an unconscious person will die without immediate medical treatment.\n\nIn cases where an individual is provided insufficient information to form a reasoned decision, serious ethical issues arise. Such cases in a [[clinical trial]] in [[medical research]] are anticipated and prevented by an [[ethics committee]] or [[Institutional Review Board]].\n\nInformed Consent Form (ICF) templates can be found on the World Health Organization Website for practical use.<ref name=\"who\">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/ethics/review-committee/informed_consent/en/|title=WHO &#124; Informed Consent Form Templates|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\n\nInformed consent can be complex to evaluate, because neither expressions of consent, nor expressions of understanding of implications, necessarily mean that full adult consent was in fact given, nor that full comprehension of relevant issues is internally digested. Consent may be implied within the usual subtleties of human communication, rather than explicitly negotiated verbally or in writing. In some cases consent cannot legally be possible, even if the person protests he does indeed understand and wish. There are also structured instruments for evaluating capacity to give informed consent, although no ideal instrument presently exists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThus, there is always a degree to which informed consent must be assumed or inferred based upon observation, or knowledge, or legal reliance. This especially is the case in sexual or relational issues. In medical or formal circumstances, explicit agreement by means of signature\u2014normally relied on legally\u2014regardless of actual consent, is the norm. This is the case with certain procedures, such as a \"[[do not resuscitate]]\" directive that a patient signed before onset of their illness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBrief examples of each of the above:\n# A person may verbally agree to something from fear, perceived social pressure, or psychological difficulty in asserting true feelings. The person requesting the action may honestly be unaware of this and believe the consent is genuine, and rely on it. ''Consent is expressed, but not internally given.''\n# A person may claim to understand the implications of some action, as part of consent, but in fact has failed to appreciate the possible consequences fully and may later deny the validity of the consent for this reason. ''Understanding needed for informed consent is present but is, in fact (through ignorance), not present.''\n# A person signs a [[legal release]] form for a [[medical procedure]], and later feels he did not really consent. Unless he can show actual misinformation, the release is usually persuasive or conclusive in law, in that the clinician may rely legally upon it for consent. ''In formal circumstances, a written consent usually legally overrides later denial of informed consent (unless obtained by misrepresentation)''.\n# Informed consent in the U.S. can be overridden in emergency medical situations pursuant to [[21CFR50.24]], which was first brought to the general public's attention via the controversy surrounding the study of [[Polyheme]].\n\n==Valid elements==\n\nFor an individual to give valid informed consent, three components must be present: disclosure, capacity and voluntariness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Faden |first=R.

The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.\n\n===Requirements of the professional===\nUntil 2015 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], informed consent in medical procedures requires proof as to the standard of care to expect as a recognised standard of acceptable professional practice (the [[Bolam Test]]), that is, what risks would a medical professional usually disclose in the circumstances (see [[Loss of right in English law]]). Arguably, this is \"sufficient consent\" rather than \"informed consent.\" The UK has since departed from the Bolam test for judging standards of informed consent, due to the landmark ruling in ''[[Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board]]''. This moves away from the concept of a reasonable physician and instead uses the standard of a [[Reasonable person|reasonable patient]], and what risks an individual would attach significance to.\n\nMedicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada also takes this patient-centric approach to \"informed consent.\" Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient. This approach combines an objective (a hypothetical reasonable patient) and subjective (this particular patient) approach.\n\nThe doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to [[assault (tort)|assault]] or [[battery (tort)|battery]]. The consent standard here is only that the person understands, in general terms, the nature of and purpose of the intended intervention. As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out. Significantly, causation must be shown: That had the individual been made aware of the risk he would not have proceeded with the operation (or perhaps with that surgeon).\n\nOptimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on the context of the delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who is saying it and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than ''what'' is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical \"Western\" countries.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/746187?src=mp&spon=25 Too Much Information: Informed Consent in Cultural Context]. By Joseph J. Fins and Pablo Rodriguez del Pozo. Medscape 07/18/2011</ref>\n\nThe informed consent doctrine is generally implemented through good healthcare practice: pre-operation discussions with patients and the use of medical consent forms in hospitals. However, reliance on a signed form should not undermine the basis of the doctrine in giving the patient an opportunity to weigh and respond to the risk. In one British case, a doctor performing routine surgery on a woman noticed that she had cancerous tissue in her womb. He took the initiative to remove the woman's womb; however, as she had not given informed consent for this operation, the doctor was judged by the [[General Medical Council]] to have acted negligently. The council stated that the woman should have been informed of her condition, and allowed to make her own decision.\n\n===Obtaining informed consents===\n\nTo capture and manage informed consents, hospital management systems typically use paper-based consent forms which are scanned and stored in a document handling system after obtaining the necessary signatures. Hospital systems and research organizations are adopting an electronic way of capturing informed consents to enable indexing, to improve comprehension, search and retrieval of consent data, thus enhancing the ability to honor to patient intent and identify willing research participants.<ref name=\"healthsciencessc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|title=Health Sciences South Carolina|publisher=healthsciencessc.org|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011200835/http://healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|archivedate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chalil Madathil | first1 = K. | last2 = Koikkara | first2 = R. | last3 = Gramopadhye | first3 = A.

In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a [[health care proxy]] makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.\n\nBy contrast, '[[Minor (law)|minors]]' (which may be defined differently in different jurisdictions) are generally presumed incompetent to consent, but depending on their age and other factors may be required to provide [[Informed assent]]. In some jurisdictions (e.g. much of the U.S.), this is a strict standard. In other jurisdictions (e.g. England, Australia, Canada), this presumption may be rebutted through proof that the minor is \u2018mature\u2019 (the \u2018[[Gillick competence|Gillick standard]]\u2019). In cases of incompetent minors, informed consent is usually required from the parent (rather than the 'best interests standard') although a [[parens patriae]] order may apply, allowing the court to dispense with parental consent in cases of refusal.\n\n===Deception===\n\nResearch involving deception is controversial given the requirement for informed consent. Deception typically arises in social psychology, when researching a particular psychological process requires that investigators deceive subjects. For example, in the [[Milgram experiment]], researchers wanted to determine the willingness of participants to obey authority figures despite their personal conscientious objections. They had authority figures demand that participants deliver what they thought was an electric shock to another research participant. For the study to succeed, it was necessary to deceive the participants so they believed that the subject was a peer and that their electric shocks caused the peer actual pain.\n\nNonetheless, research involving deception prevents subjects from exercising their basic right of autonomous informed decision-making and conflicts with the ethical principle of [[respect for persons]].\n\nThe [[Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct]] set by the [[American Psychological Association]] says that psychologists may conduct research that includes a deceptive compartment only if they can both justify the act by the value and importance of the study's results and show they could not obtain the results by some other way. Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, either physical pain or [[emotional distress]]. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session in which the experimenter both tells the subject about the deception and gives subject the option of withdrawing the data.<ref>{{cite web|last=2.

Other countries with such laws (e.g. [[Germany]]) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Taupitz |first1=Jochen |last2=Weschka |first2=Marion |date=2009 |title=CHIMBRIDS - Chimeras and Hybrids in Comparative European and International Research: Scientific, Ethical, Philosophical and Legal Aspects.

This \"consent by proxy\" usually works reasonably well, but can lead to ethical dilemmas when the judgment of the parents or guardians and the medical professional differ with regard to what constitutes appropriate decisions \"in the best interest of the child\". Children who are [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]], and certain situations such as decisions regarding sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy, or for unemancipated minors who are deemed to have medical decision making capacity, may be able to provide consent without the need for parental permission depending on the laws of the jurisdiction the child lives in. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] encourages medical professionals also to seek the assent of older children and adolescents by providing age appropriate information to these children to help empower them in the decision making process.<ref name=\"AAP\">{{cite journal | author = Committee on Bioethics  | year = 1995 | title = Informed consent, parental permission, and assent in pediatric practice | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/95/2/314.full.pdf | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 2| pages = 314\u20137 | pmid = 7838658 }}</ref>\n\nResearch on children has benefited society in many ways. The only effective way to establish normal patterns of growth and metabolism is to do research on infants and young children. When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent.

Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf |title=Guideline For Good Clinical Practice |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}</ref>\nIn [[medical research]], the [[Nuremberg Code]] set a base international standard in 1947, which continued to develop, for example in response to the ethical violation in the [[Holocaust]]. Nowadays, medical research is overseen by an [[ethics committee]] that also oversees the informed consent process.\n\nAs the medical guidelines established in the Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the [[social science]]s, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Homan |first=R. |year=1991 |title=The Ethics of Social Research |location=London; New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0-582-05879-8 }}</ref> However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, it is not always required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the [[Hawthorne Effect]]: \"In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=S.

Seedings were based strictly on regular-season record. The team with the best record received the #1 seed, the team with the next best record received the #2 seed, and so on. The top two seeds earned double byes (i.e., advanced directly to the semifinals), while the next two seeds received first-round byes.\n\nThese seedings were used to create a bracket that determines the matchups throughout the playoffs. The first round of the playoffs consisted of two matchups based on the seedings (5-8 and 6-7). The two winners advanced to the second round with a matchup between the number three seed and the lower of the advancing seeds and another matchup between the number four seed and the other first round winner. The winners of the first two rounds advanced to the semifinals, where the lower-ranked seed of the winners faces the number one seed, with the other remaining team facing the number two seed.\n\nThe first two rounds were single-elimination games played on the higher ranking seed's home court. The semifinals and WNBA Finals are best-of-five series played in a 2-2-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage (better record) hosts games 1, 2, and 5 while their opponent hosts games 3 and 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/wnba-regular-season-playoff-formats/|title=WNBA Regular Season and Playoff Formats|website=wnba.com|publisher=WNBA|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Tiebreak procedures ===\n# Better winning percentage among all head-to-head games involving tied teams.\n# Better winning percentage against all teams with .500 or better record at the end of the season.\n# Better point differential in games net result of total points scored less total points allowed head-to-head.\n# Better point differential net result of total points scored less total points allowed against all opponents.\n# Coin toss (or draw of lots, if at least three teams are still tied after the first four tiebreakers fail).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/standings/#?season=2018|title=2018 Regular Season Standings|website=wnba.com|publisher=WNBA|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Playoff qualifying ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Seed !!rowspan=2|Team !!rowspan=2|Record !!colspan=3|Clinched\n|-\n!Playoff berth !!

The Mystics come into the series having won ten straight home games.\n\n;Game 1\n\nThe first quarter was a close affair, with the Aces shooting 73.3% but still trailing.  They carried that momentum into a seven-point halftime lead.  However, the Mystics came back in the third quarter, winning the quarter by ten points and carrying a three-point lead into the final period.  The Mystics managed to hold off an Aces comeback and win by two points.  The Mystics lead by as many as thirteen in the fourth quarter, and the Aces never managed to pull ahead, always trailing by at least two points.  [[Emma Meesseman]] scored a career playoff high twenty seven points.  [[A'ja Wilson]] scored twenty three points to lead the Aces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wnba.com/game/20190917/LVAWAS/#/game-story|title=Delle Donne, Meesseman help Mystics edge Aces, 97-95|website=wnba.com|publisher=The Associated Press|first=Ian|last=Quillen|date=September 17, 2019|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{basketballbox\n | bg = #eee\n | date = September 17\n | time = 8:30pm ET\n | report = [https://www.wnba.com/game/20190917/LVAWAS/#/box-score Box Score]\n | team1 = #1 '''[[2019 Washington Mystics season|Washington Mystics]]'''\n | score1 = '''97'''\n | score2 = 95\n | team2 = #4 [[2019 Las Vegas Aces season|Las Vegas Aces]]\n | Q1 = '''30'''\u201327 | Q2 = 20\u2013'''30''' | Q3 = '''26'''\u201316 | Q4 = 21\u2013'''22'''\n | points1 = [[Emma Meesseman]] (27)\n | points2 = [[A'ja Wilson]] (23)\n | rebounds1 = [[Emma Meesseman]] (10)\n | rebounds2 = [[Liz Cambage]] (12)\n | assist1 = [[Elena Delle Donne]] (6)\n | assist2 = [[Kelsey Plum]] (9)\n | place = [[St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena|Entertainment and Sports Arena]]<!--The Mystics list the arena on their website as \"ESA\" (spelled out).--> \n | attendance = 3,968\n | referee = Roy Gulbeyan<br>Tim Greene<br>Billy Smith<br>Tiara Cruse\n | TV = [[WNBA on ESPN|ESPN2]], [[The Sports Network|TSN4/5]]\n}}\n\n;Game 2\n\nGame two proved to be a tight affair in the first half, with the Mystics taking a one-point lead into halftime.

Connecticut had the WNBA's second best regular season record at 23\u201311.  However, the Sun finished the regular season 3\u20133, including losses in their last two games.  The Sun had a 15\u20132 home record, which was tied for the WNBA's best with the Sparks.  The Sparks won the regular season series 2\u20131, with the home team winning each matchup.\n\n;Game 1\n\nThe first two quarters were a back and forth affair, with the Sun winning the first quarter by seven points and the Sparks winning the second quarter by ten points.  However, the Sun scored the first nine points after halftime and never looked back.  The Sun won their first playoff game since 2012 behind four double-digit scorers.  The Sparks had two players score twenty or more points, but no other players scored in double-digits.  The Sun held the Sparks starting back court to 3\u201317 shooting and force seventeen turnovers. This was [[Chiney Ogwumike]]'s first playoff game in Connecticut since the former Sun star was granted a trade to LA in the offseason. She was booed when the lineups were announced and each time she touched the ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wnba.com/game/20190917/LASCON/#/game-story|title=Sun top Sparks 84-75 in Game 1 of WNBA semifinals|website=wnba.com|publisher=The Associated Press|first=Pat|last=Eaton-Robb|date=September 17, 2019|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{basketballbox\n | bg = #eee\n | date = September 17\n | time = 6:30pm ET\n | report = [https://www.wnba.com/game/20190917/LASCON/#/box-score Box Score]\n | team1 = #2 '''[[2019 Connecticut Sun season|Connecticut Sun]]'''\n | score1 = '''84'''\n | score2 = 75\n | team2 = #3 [[2019 Los Angeles Sparks season|Los Angeles Sparks]]\n | Q1 = '''21'''\u201314 | Q2 = 16\u2013'''26''' | Q3 = '''22'''\u201318 | Q4 = '''25'''\u201317\n | points1 = [[Alyssa Thomas]] (22)\n | points2 = [[Candice Parker]] (24)\n | rebounds1 = [[Alyssa Thomas]] (10)\n | rebounds2 = [[Candice Parker]]/[[Nneka Ogwumike]] (10)\n | assist1 = [[Jasmine Thomas (basketball)|Jasmine Thomas]] (8)\n | assist2 = [[Chelsea Gray]] (4)\n | otherstat1 = \n | otherstat2 = \n | place = [[Mohegan Sun Arena]]\n | attendance = 7,102\n | referee = Michael Price<br>Cheryl Flores<br>Isaac Barnett\n | TV = [[WNBA on ESPN|ESPN2]], [[Sportsnet One|SN1]]\n}}\n\n;Game 2\n\nThe first half of game two was a story of two quarters, with the Sparks winning the first quarter by seven points, but the Sun winning the second by eight points.

Seedings were based strictly on regular-season record. The team with the best record received the #1 seed, the team with the next best record received the #2 seed, and so on. The top two seeds earned double byes (i.e., advanced directly to the semifinals), while the next two seeds received first-round byes.\n\nThese seedings were used to create a bracket that determines the matchups throughout the playoffs. The first round of the playoffs consisted of two matchups based on the seedings (5-8 and 6-7). The two winners advanced to the second round with a matchup between the number three seed and the lower of the advancing seeds and another matchup between the number four seed and the other first round winner. The winners of the first two rounds advanced to the semifinals, where the lower-ranked seed of the winners faces the number one seed, with the other remaining team facing the number two seed.\n\nThe first two rounds were single-elimination games played on the higher ranking seed's home court.

It is not a form of cellular respiration, but it does generate ATP, break down glucose, and produce waste products.  \nFermentation, like aerobic respiration, begins by breaking glucose into two [[pyruvate]] molecules.  From here, it proceeds using [[endogenous]] organic electron receptors, whereas cellular respiration uses [[exogenous]] receptors, such as oxygen in aerobic respiration and nitrate in anaerobic respiration.  These varied organic receptors each generate different waste products. \nCommon products are lactic acid, lactose, hydrogen, and ethanol.  Carbon dioxide is also commonly produced.<ref>Voet, Donald & Voet, Judith G. (1995). Biochemistry (2nd ed.).

It starts along the same pathway as aerobic respiration, but once glucose is converted to [[pyruvate]] proceeds down one of two pathways and produces only two molecules of ATP from each molecule of glucose. In the homolactic pathway, it produces [[lactic acid]] as waste.  In the heterolactic pathway, it produces lactic acid as well as [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology, 7th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=0-8053-7146-X}}</ref> \nLactic acid fermentation is relatively inefficient.  The waste products lactic acid and ethanol have not been fully oxidized and still contain energy, but it requires the addition of oxygen to extract this energy.<ref>[[Fermentation (biochemistry)]]</ref>\n\nGenerally, lactic acid fermentation occurs only when aerobic cells are lacking oxygen. However, some aerobic mammalian cells will preferentially use lactic acid fermentation over aerobic respiration.

From here, it proceeds using [[endogenous]] organic electron receptors, whereas cellular respiration uses [[exogenous]] receptors, such as oxygen in aerobic respiration and nitrate in anaerobic respiration.  These varied organic receptors each generate different waste products. \nCommon products are lactic acid, lactose, hydrogen, and ethanol.  Carbon dioxide is also commonly produced.<ref>Voet, Donald & Voet, Judith G. (1995). Biochemistry (2nd ed.). New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-471-58651-7}}.</ref>\nFermentation occurs primarily in anaerobic conditions, although some organisms such as yeast use fermentation even when oxygen is plentiful.\n\n===Lactic Acid Fermentation===\n{{main article|Lactic acid fermentation}}\n\n'''Simplified Theoretical Reaction:''' C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> <math>\\to</math> 2C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 ATP (120 kJ)<ref>[[Lactic acid fermentation#cite ref-campbell 3-1]]</ref> \nLactic Acid Fermentation is commonly known as the process by which mammalian muscle cells produce energy in anaerobic environments, as in instances of great physical exertion, and is the simplest type of fermentation.  It starts along the same pathway as aerobic respiration, but once glucose is converted to [[pyruvate]] proceeds down one of two pathways and produces only two molecules of ATP from each molecule of glucose. In the homolactic pathway, it produces [[lactic acid]] as waste.  In the heterolactic pathway, it produces lactic acid as well as [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology, 7th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=0-8053-7146-X}}</ref> \nLactic acid fermentation is relatively inefficient.  The waste products lactic acid and ethanol have not been fully oxidized and still contain energy, but it requires the addition of oxygen to extract this energy.<ref>[[Fermentation (biochemistry)]]</ref>\n\nGenerally, lactic acid fermentation occurs only when aerobic cells are lacking oxygen. However, some aerobic mammalian cells will preferentially use lactic acid fermentation over aerobic respiration.  This phenomenon is called the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]] and is found primarily in cancer cells.<ref>Warburg O (1956). \"On the origin of cancer cells\". Science 123 (3191): 309\u2013314.

Lactic acid fermentation is somewhat faster, although less efficient, than aerobic respiration, so in activities like sprinting it can help quickly provide needed energy to muscles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Stephen|title=Why does lactic acid build up in muscles?

Depending on the pathways followed, the products are dealt with in different ways.\n\nCO<sub>2</sub> is excreted from the cell via [[diffusion]] into the blood stream, where it is transported in three ways:\n*Up to 7% is dissolved in its molecular form in blood plasma.\n* About 70-80% is converted into hydrocarbonate ions,\n* The remainder binds with [[haemoglobin]] in red blood cells, is carried to the lungs, and exhaled.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKinley|first=Michael|title=Human Anatomy (3rd Ed)|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337809-1|pages=638\u2013643, 748}}</ref>\n\nH<sub>2</sub>O also diffuses out of the cell into the bloodstream, from where it is excreted in the form of perspiration, water vapour in the breath, or [[urine]] from the [[kidneys]].

Presumably, the greater accuracy and range of the [[Rifled musket|rifle musket]] rendered that approach obsolete, and the Civil War armies' transition to longer battles in 1864 is taken by numerous scholars as proof of the new technology's transformative impact. More recently, however, academics have begun to reject this narrative. Earl J. Hess judges the tactical training of the Civil War as critical to the armies' success, and maintains that the dearth of overwhelming victories during the conflict was actually consistent with the infrequency of such battles throughout history.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil War Infantry Tactics: Training, Combat, and Small-Unit Effectiveness|last=Hess|first=Earl J.|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Baton Rouge|pages=227, 235}}</ref> [[Allen C.

However, the majority spent their time on garrison or fatigue duty. In general, the majority of the infantry officers were graduates of military schools such as the [[United States Military Academy]].\n\nIn some cases, individual states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], had previously organized formal [[militia]] infantry regiments, originally to fight Indians in many cases, but by 1861, they existed mostly for social camaraderie and parades. These organizations were more prevalent in the [[Southern United States|South]], where hundreds of small local militia companies existed.\n\nWith the [[secession]] of eleven Southern states by early 1861 following the election of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], tens of thousands of Southern men flocked to hastily organized companies, which were soon formed into [[regiment]]s, [[brigade]]s, and small armies, forming the genesis of the [[Confederate States Army]]. Lincoln responded by issuing a call for [[75,000 volunteers]], and later even more, to put down the rebellion, and the [[Northern United States|Northern states]] responded. The resulting forces came to be known as the Volunteer Army (even though they were paid), versus the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. More than seventeen hundred state volunteer regiments were raised for the Union Army throughout the war,<ref name=\":0\" /> with infantry comprising over 80% of the manpower in these forces.\n\n== Organization ==\n[[File:Officers 80th New York Infantry Culpeper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Officers of the [[80th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|80th New York Infantry]], [[Culpeper, Virginia]], 1863]]\nThe typical infantry regiment of the early Civil War consisted of 10 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (each with exactly 100 men, according to [[William J. Hardee|Hardee's]] 1855 manual, and led by a [[Captain (United States)|captain]], with associated [[lieutenant]]s). Field officers normally included a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] (commanding), [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and at least one [[Major (United States)|major]]. With attrition from disease, battle casualties, desertions and transfers, by the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300\u2013400 men. Volunteer regiments were paid by the individual states, and officers at first were normally elected by popular vote, or were appointed by the state governors (particularly the colonels, who were often the men who had raised and organized the regiment). As the war progressed, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and superior officers began selecting regimental leaders, and the regimental officers normally selected the NCOs (non-commissioned officers) based on performance and merit, although the individual states retained considerable influence in the selection of the regimental officers.\n\nOften, and always, according to Hardee's 1855 manual, large regiments were broken into two or more [[battalion]]s, with the lieutenant colonel and major(s) in charge of each battalion. The regiment may have also been divided into two wings, the left and right, for instructional purposes, only. The regimental commander exercised overall tactical control over these officers and usually relied on couriers and staff to deliver and receive messages and orders. Normally positioned in the center of the regiment in battle formation was the [[color guard]], typically five to eight men assigned to carry and protect the regimental and/or national colors, led by a color sergeant. Most [[Union Army|Union]] regiments carried both banners; the typical Confederate regiment simply had a national standard.\n\nIndividual regiments (usually three to five, although the number varied) were organized and grouped into a larger body (a brigade) which soon became the main structure for battlefield maneuvers. Generally, the brigade was commanded by a [[Brigadier General#United States|brigadier general]], or senior colonel, when merit was clearly evident in that colonel and a general was not available. Two to four brigades typically comprised a [[division (military)|division]], which in theory was commanded by a [[Major General#United States|major general]], but theory was often not put into practical application, especially when an officer exhibited exceptional merit or the division was smaller and trusted to a more junior officer. Several divisions would constitute a [[corps]], and multiple corps together made up an [[army]], often commanded by a [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] or full [[Full General (CSA)|general]] in the Confederate forces, and by a [[major general]] in the Union forces.\n\nBelow is charted the average make-up of the infantry for both sides.\n\n=== Confederate Army ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Soldiers were drilled in infantry tactics, usually based upon a manual written before the war by West Point professor [[William J. Hardee]] (''Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics: for the Instruction, Exercise and Maneuver of Riflemen and Light Infantry'', published in 1855). Another treatise commonly used was from [[Winfield Scott]], entitled ''Infantry Tactics, or Rules for Manoeuvers of the United States Infantry''. Originally published in 1835, it was the standard drill manual for the U. S. Army.  Other popular instruction manuals were issued early in the Civil War, including ''McClellan's Bayonet Drill'' (1862) and ''Casey's Infantry Tactics'' (1862).\n\nTraditionally, historians have stated that many generals, particularly early in the war, preferred to use Napoleonic tactics, despite the increased killing power of period weaponry. They marched their men out in tightly closed formations, often with soldiers elbow-to-elbow in double-rank battle lines, usually in brigade (by mid-war numbering about 2,500\u20133,000 infantrymen) or division (by mid-war numbering about 6,000\u201310,000 infantrymen) strength. This large mass presented an easy target for defenders, who could easily fire several volleys before his enemy would be close enough for [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The idea was to close on the enemy's position with this mass of soldiers and charge them with the [[bayonet]], convincing the enemy to leave their position or be killed. At times, these soon-to-be outdated tactics contributed to high casualty lists.\n\nHowever, historians such as Allen C. Guelzo reject this traditional criticism of Civil War infantry tactics.  Casualty estimates compared with expended ammunition from battles indicate 1 casualty for every 250\u2013300 shots discharged, not a dramatic improvement over Napoleonic casualty rates. No contemporary accounts indicate that engagement ranges with substantial casualties between infantry occurred at ranges beyond Napoleonic engagement ranges.\n\nTo explain this seeming contradiction between technology and tactical reality, Guelzo points out that even when laboratory tests indicates accuracy with a rifled musket from 600 yards, in an actual battlefield situation, the lack of [[smokeless powder]] quickly would obscure visibility. The gunpowder of the time produced a great deal of smoke when fired. Thus, in larger battles, battles began with artillery firing for some time, and skirmishers had been firing at each other for some time. By the time the main lines of infantry began approaching each other, visibility was significantly obscured. Once the infantry began the main engagement, visibility quickly was reduced to almost nil. With the lack of visibility, only massed infantry fire was effective, and this reality is reflected in the tactics of the time. Guelzo argues that rifling only truly benefited the sharpshooters on the skirmish line, who fought before their visibility was obscured, but the main line of infantry could not take advantage of the benefits of rifling.\n\nIn ''Gettysburg, the Last Invasion'', Guelzo also points out the technical difficulty of aiming a rifled musket at longer ranges. While rifling improved overall accuracy of muskets, the rifling also formed a trajectory that caused the bullet to quickly \"drop\" from where it was aimed (in contrast to the flat trajectory of smoothbore muskets fired at close range). Thus to hit a target at distances beyond 40\u201350 yards, the rifleman would require knowledge of trajectory and distance, aiming the rifle at a precise angle above the target. In actual battlefield situations, such precise aiming was virtually impossible. Under the stress of battle, virtually every infantryman asked about aiming on the battlefield replied that in practice, the best one could do was \"simply raise his rifle to the horizontal, and fire without aiming.\" (Guelzo p.&nbsp;37).<ref>Guelzo, ''Gettysburg: The Last Invasion'', 37</ref>\n\nAn additional limitation on unlocking the potential of the rifle was the availability of gunpowder, and the pursuant lack of training. Prior to the development of industrialized chemical plants producing copious amounts of gunpowder, in the mid-19th centuries, armies simply could not expend large amounts of gunpowder for training. As a result, the average infantryman simply did not have extensive firearms training beyond simple maintenance and loading drills. The infantryman simply did not know how to aim his rifle at long distances\u2014eyewitnesses report entire companies aiming their rifles at a 45 degree angle facing the sky and discharging their rifles at Bull Run (Guelzo p.&nbsp;59). Such untrained soldiers could not be expected to engage an enemy much further than point blank range with any level of accuracy.\n\nThus Guelzo doubts that contemporary military leaders blatantly ignored technological advances. Rather, Guelzo argued that in actual battlefield conditions, until the development of smokeless powder, the benefits of rifling were largely nullified. Therefore, generals did not alter their tactics not due to ignorance, but because the battlefield had not changed substantially from the Napoleonic era. \n\nOf particular tactical importance was the usage of [[skirmisher]]s, usually small bodies of advanced troops which were often spaced several yards apart, and more specifically, five paces per man, according to Hardee's manual. They screened a defensive line from oncoming enemy soldiers, harassed attackers, probed enemy strength in preparation for an attack, and screened the assaulting columns. However, the skirmish formation was forfeited in most cases, for a line of battle was of preference. Skirmish formation would be used to take up large distances of an open front, which rarely occurred at the larger scale battles. Nevertheless, it was drilled into the recruits, should the opportunity to take skirmish formation arise in a combat scenario.\n\nAttacks were carried out in several manners, including single or double rank battle lines with individual regiments side-by-side in a line of battle, assault waves (with multiple regiments or brigades in successive waves spaced out loosely one behind the other), brigade columns (all regiments of a brigade in line one behind the other in close formation), and other formations.\n\n==Weapons and equipment==\n[[Image:Springfield Model 1861 Repro.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern reproduction of the [[Springfield Model 1861]]]]\nTrained in the era of short-range smoothbore [[musket]]s, such as the [[Springfield Model 1842]], which was issued to many units immediately prior to the war, many generals often did not fully appreciate or understand the importance and power of the new weapons introduced during the war, such as the [[Springfield Model 1861|1861 Springfield rifled musket]] and comparable rifles which had longer range and were more powerful than the weapons used by the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] armies. Its barrel contained several [[rifle]]d grooves that provided increased accuracy, and fired a .58 [[caliber]] [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] (a small conical-shaped ball). This rifle had a deadly effect up to 600 yards and was capable of seriously wounding a man beyond 1,000 yards, unlike the previous muskets used during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and Napoleonic Wars, most of which had an effective range of only 100 yards.\n\nHowever, as stated above, historians like Guelzo argue these benefits were largely nullified by the lack of visibility on a Civil War battlefield.  Engagements necessarily took place with massed lines of infantry at ranges of around 100 yards, for the simple fact the enemy could not be seen at longer distances since neither side employed smokeless powder in their weapons. In many engagements, unless there was a strong wind on the battlefield, the first volley from each side would obscure the enemy's line for a considerable time in gunsmoke. Hence, the standard doctrine on both sides was to close with the enemy and fire at point-blank range for maximum effect.\n\nEven smoothbore muskets underwent improvements: soldiers developed the technique of \"buck and ball,\" loading the muskets with a combination of small pellets and a single round ball, effectively making their fire scattergun-like in effect. Other infantrymen went into combat armed with [[shotgun]]s, [[pistol]]s, knives, and assorted other killing instruments. Very early in the war, a few companies were armed with [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]]. However, by the end of 1862, most infantrymen were armed with rifles, including imports from [[Great Britain]], [[Belgium]], and other European countries.\n\nThe typical Union soldier carried his musket, percussion cap box, [[cartridge box]], a canteen, a knapsack, and other accoutrements, in addition to any personal effects. By contrast, many Southern soldiers carried their possessions in a blanket roll worn around the shoulder and tied at the waist. They might have a wooden canteen, a linen or cotton haversack for food, and a knife or similar sidearm, as well as their musket.\n\nOne primary account of the typical infantryman came from James Gall, a representative of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], who observed Confederate infantrymen of [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Jubal A. Early]] in camp in the occupied borough of [[York, Pennsylvania]], in late June 1863, sometime after the [[Second Battle of Winchester]].\n\n{{Quotation|Physically, the men looked about equal to the generality of our own troops, and there were fewer boys among them.

They consisted of a thin woolen blanket, coiled up and slung from the shoulder in the form of a sash, a haversack swung from the opposite shoulder, and a cartridge-box. The whole cannot weigh more than twelve or fourteen pounds. Is it strange, then, that with such light loads, they should be able to make longer and more rapid marches than our men? The marching of the men was irregular and careless, their arms were rusty and ill kept. Their whole appearance was greatly inferior to that of our soldiers... There were not tents for the men, and but few for the officers... Everything that will trammel or impede the movement of the army is discarded, no matter what the consequences may be to the men... In speaking of our soldiers, the same officer remarked: 'They are too well fed, too well clothed, and have far too much to carry.' That our men are too well fed, I do not believe, neither that they are too well clothed; that they have too much to carry, I can very well believe, after witnessing the march of the Army of the Potomac to Chancellorsville. Each man had eight days' rations to carry, besides sixty rounds of ammunition, musket, woollen blanket, rubber blanket, overcoat, extra shirt, drawers, socks, and shelter tent, amounting in all to about sixty pounds. Think of men, and boys too, staggering along under such a load, at the rate of fifteen to twenty miles a day.<ref>Scott L.

With the exception of some volunteer regiments receiving extra funding from their state or wealthy commander, the small numbers of rapid-fire weapons in service with US infantrymen, often skirmishers, were mostly purchased privately by soldiers themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aotc.net/Spencer.htm|title=The Spencer Repeating rifle|last=Redman|first=Bob|website=www.aotc.net|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref> \n\nDespite President Lincoln's enthusiasm for these types of weapons, the mass adoption of repeating rifles for the infantry was resisted by some senior Union officers. The most common concerns cited about the weapons were their high-cost, massive use of ammunition and the considerable extra smoke produced on the battlefield. The most influential detractor of these new rifles was 67-year-old [[James Wolfe Ripley|General James Ripley,]] the US Army's ordnance chief. He adamantly opposed the adoption of, what he called, \"these newfangled gimcracks,\" believing they would encourage soldiers to \"waste ammunition.\" He also argued that the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|quartermaster corps]] could not field enough ammunition to keep a repeater-armed army supplied for any extended campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/the-unions-newfangled-gimcracks/|title=The Union's 'Newfangled Gimcracks'|last=Leigh|first=Phil|work=Opinionator|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOne notable exception was [[John T.

More recently, however, academics have begun to reject this narrative. Earl J.

However, the majority spent their time on garrison or fatigue duty. In general, the majority of the infantry officers were graduates of military schools such as the [[United States Military Academy]].\n\nIn some cases, individual states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], had previously organized formal [[militia]] infantry regiments, originally to fight Indians in many cases, but by 1861, they existed mostly for social camaraderie and parades. These organizations were more prevalent in the [[Southern United States|South]], where hundreds of small local militia companies existed.\n\nWith the [[secession]] of eleven Southern states by early 1861 following the election of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], tens of thousands of Southern men flocked to hastily organized companies, which were soon formed into [[regiment]]s, [[brigade]]s, and small armies, forming the genesis of the [[Confederate States Army]]. Lincoln responded by issuing a call for [[75,000 volunteers]], and later even more, to put down the rebellion, and the [[Northern United States|Northern states]] responded. The resulting forces came to be known as the Volunteer Army (even though they were paid), versus the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. More than seventeen hundred state volunteer regiments were raised for the Union Army throughout the war,<ref name=\":0\" /> with infantry comprising over 80% of the manpower in these forces.\n\n== Organization ==\n[[File:Officers 80th New York Infantry Culpeper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Officers of the [[80th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|80th New York Infantry]], [[Culpeper, Virginia]], 1863]]\nThe typical infantry regiment of the early Civil War consisted of 10 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (each with exactly 100 men, according to [[William J. Hardee|Hardee's]] 1855 manual, and led by a [[Captain (United States)|captain]], with associated [[lieutenant]]s). Field officers normally included a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] (commanding), [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and at least one [[Major (United States)|major]]. With attrition from disease, battle casualties, desertions and transfers, by the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300\u2013400 men. Volunteer regiments were paid by the individual states, and officers at first were normally elected by popular vote, or were appointed by the state governors (particularly the colonels, who were often the men who had raised and organized the regiment). As the war progressed, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and superior officers began selecting regimental leaders, and the regimental officers normally selected the NCOs (non-commissioned officers) based on performance and merit, although the individual states retained considerable influence in the selection of the regimental officers.\n\nOften, and always, according to Hardee's 1855 manual, large regiments were broken into two or more [[battalion]]s, with the lieutenant colonel and major(s) in charge of each battalion. The regiment may have also been divided into two wings, the left and right, for instructional purposes, only. The regimental commander exercised overall tactical control over these officers and usually relied on couriers and staff to deliver and receive messages and orders. Normally positioned in the center of the regiment in battle formation was the [[color guard]], typically five to eight men assigned to carry and protect the regimental and/or national colors, led by a color sergeant. Most [[Union Army|Union]] regiments carried both banners; the typical Confederate regiment simply had a national standard.\n\nIndividual regiments (usually three to five, although the number varied) were organized and grouped into a larger body (a brigade) which soon became the main structure for battlefield maneuvers. Generally, the brigade was commanded by a [[Brigadier General#United States|brigadier general]], or senior colonel, when merit was clearly evident in that colonel and a general was not available. Two to four brigades typically comprised a [[division (military)|division]], which in theory was commanded by a [[Major General#United States|major general]], but theory was often not put into practical application, especially when an officer exhibited exceptional merit or the division was smaller and trusted to a more junior officer. Several divisions would constitute a [[corps]], and multiple corps together made up an [[army]], often commanded by a [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]] or full [[Full General (CSA)|general]] in the Confederate forces, and by a [[major general]] in the Union forces.\n\nBelow is charted the average make-up of the infantry for both sides.\n\n=== Confederate Army ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Soldiers were drilled in infantry tactics, usually based upon a manual written before the war by West Point professor [[William J. Hardee]] (''Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics: for the Instruction, Exercise and Maneuver of Riflemen and Light Infantry'', published in 1855). Another treatise commonly used was from [[Winfield Scott]], entitled ''Infantry Tactics, or Rules for Manoeuvers of the United States Infantry''. Originally published in 1835, it was the standard drill manual for the U. S. Army.  Other popular instruction manuals were issued early in the Civil War, including ''McClellan's Bayonet Drill'' (1862) and ''Casey's Infantry Tactics'' (1862).\n\nTraditionally, historians have stated that many generals, particularly early in the war, preferred to use Napoleonic tactics, despite the increased killing power of period weaponry. They marched their men out in tightly closed formations, often with soldiers elbow-to-elbow in double-rank battle lines, usually in brigade (by mid-war numbering about 2,500\u20133,000 infantrymen) or division (by mid-war numbering about 6,000\u201310,000 infantrymen) strength. This large mass presented an easy target for defenders, who could easily fire several volleys before his enemy would be close enough for [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The idea was to close on the enemy's position with this mass of soldiers and charge them with the [[bayonet]], convincing the enemy to leave their position or be killed. At times, these soon-to-be outdated tactics contributed to high casualty lists.\n\nHowever, historians such as Allen C. Guelzo reject this traditional criticism of Civil War infantry tactics.  Casualty estimates compared with expended ammunition from battles indicate 1 casualty for every 250\u2013300 shots discharged, not a dramatic improvement over Napoleonic casualty rates. No contemporary accounts indicate that engagement ranges with substantial casualties between infantry occurred at ranges beyond Napoleonic engagement ranges.\n\nTo explain this seeming contradiction between technology and tactical reality, Guelzo points out that even when laboratory tests indicates accuracy with a rifled musket from 600 yards, in an actual battlefield situation, the lack of [[smokeless powder]] quickly would obscure visibility. The gunpowder of the time produced a great deal of smoke when fired. Thus, in larger battles, battles began with artillery firing for some time, and skirmishers had been firing at each other for some time. By the time the main lines of infantry began approaching each other, visibility was significantly obscured. Once the infantry began the main engagement, visibility quickly was reduced to almost nil. With the lack of visibility, only massed infantry fire was effective, and this reality is reflected in the tactics of the time. Guelzo argues that rifling only truly benefited the sharpshooters on the skirmish line, who fought before their visibility was obscured, but the main line of infantry could not take advantage of the benefits of rifling.\n\nIn ''Gettysburg, the Last Invasion'', Guelzo also points out the technical difficulty of aiming a rifled musket at longer ranges. While rifling improved overall accuracy of muskets, the rifling also formed a trajectory that caused the bullet to quickly \"drop\" from where it was aimed (in contrast to the flat trajectory of smoothbore muskets fired at close range). Thus to hit a target at distances beyond 40\u201350 yards, the rifleman would require knowledge of trajectory and distance, aiming the rifle at a precise angle above the target. In actual battlefield situations, such precise aiming was virtually impossible. Under the stress of battle, virtually every infantryman asked about aiming on the battlefield replied that in practice, the best one could do was \"simply raise his rifle to the horizontal, and fire without aiming.\" (Guelzo p.&nbsp;37).<ref>Guelzo, ''Gettysburg: The Last Invasion'', 37</ref>\n\nAn additional limitation on unlocking the potential of the rifle was the availability of gunpowder, and the pursuant lack of training. Prior to the development of industrialized chemical plants producing copious amounts of gunpowder, in the mid-19th centuries, armies simply could not expend large amounts of gunpowder for training. As a result, the average infantryman simply did not have extensive firearms training beyond simple maintenance and loading drills. The infantryman simply did not know how to aim his rifle at long distances\u2014eyewitnesses report entire companies aiming their rifles at a 45 degree angle facing the sky and discharging their rifles at Bull Run (Guelzo p.&nbsp;59). Such untrained soldiers could not be expected to engage an enemy much further than point blank range with any level of accuracy.\n\nThus Guelzo doubts that contemporary military leaders blatantly ignored technological advances. Rather, Guelzo argued that in actual battlefield conditions, until the development of smokeless powder, the benefits of rifling were largely nullified. Therefore, generals did not alter their tactics not due to ignorance, but because the battlefield had not changed substantially from the Napoleonic era. \n\nOf particular tactical importance was the usage of [[skirmisher]]s, usually small bodies of advanced troops which were often spaced several yards apart, and more specifically, five paces per man, according to Hardee's manual. They screened a defensive line from oncoming enemy soldiers, harassed attackers, probed enemy strength in preparation for an attack, and screened the assaulting columns. However, the skirmish formation was forfeited in most cases, for a line of battle was of preference. Skirmish formation would be used to take up large distances of an open front, which rarely occurred at the larger scale battles. Nevertheless, it was drilled into the recruits, should the opportunity to take skirmish formation arise in a combat scenario.\n\nAttacks were carried out in several manners, including single or double rank battle lines with individual regiments side-by-side in a line of battle, assault waves (with multiple regiments or brigades in successive waves spaced out loosely one behind the other), brigade columns (all regiments of a brigade in line one behind the other in close formation), and other formations.\n\n==Weapons and equipment==\n[[Image:Springfield Model 1861 Rifled Musket.jpg|right|thumb|175px|A modern reproduction of the [[Springfield Model 1861]]]]\nTrained in the era of short-range smoothbore [[musket]]s, such as the [[Springfield Model 1842]], which was issued to many units immediately prior to the war, many generals often did not fully appreciate or understand the importance and power of the new weapons introduced during the war, such as the [[Springfield Model 1861|1861 Springfield rifled musket]] and comparable rifles which had longer range and were more powerful than the weapons used by the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] armies. Its barrel contained several [[rifle]]d grooves that provided increased accuracy, and fired a .58 [[caliber]] [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] (a small conical-shaped ball). This rifle had a deadly effect up to 600 yards and was capable of seriously wounding a man beyond 1,000 yards, unlike the previous muskets used during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and Napoleonic Wars, most of which had an effective range of only 100 yards.\n\nHowever, as stated above, historians like Guelzo argue these benefits were largely nullified by the lack of visibility on a Civil War battlefield.  Engagements necessarily took place with massed lines of infantry at ranges of around 100 yards, for the simple fact the enemy could not be seen at longer distances since neither side employed smokeless powder in their weapons. In many engagements, unless there was a strong wind on the battlefield, the first volley from each side would obscure the enemy's line for a considerable time in gunsmoke. Hence, the standard doctrine on both sides was to close with the enemy and fire at point-blank range for maximum effect.\n\nEven smoothbore muskets underwent improvements: soldiers developed the technique of \"buck and ball,\" loading the muskets with a combination of small pellets and a single round ball, effectively making their fire scattergun-like in effect. Other infantrymen went into combat armed with [[shotgun]]s, [[pistol]]s, knives, and assorted other killing instruments. Very early in the war, a few companies were armed with [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]]. However, by the end of 1862, most infantrymen were armed with rifles, including imports from [[Great Britain]], [[Belgium]], and other European countries.\n\nThe typical Union soldier carried his musket, percussion cap box, [[cartridge box]], a canteen, a knapsack, and other accoutrements, in addition to any personal effects. By contrast, many Southern soldiers carried their possessions in a blanket roll worn around the shoulder and tied at the waist. They might have a wooden canteen, a linen or cotton haversack for food, and a knife or similar sidearm, as well as their musket.\n\nOne primary account of the typical infantryman came from James Gall, a representative of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], who observed Confederate infantrymen of [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Jubal A. Early]] in camp in the occupied borough of [[York, Pennsylvania]], in late June 1863, sometime after the [[Second Battle of Winchester]].\n\n{{Quotation|Physically, the men looked about equal to the generality of our own troops, and there were fewer boys among them.

Cricket Matches.\" ''Current Science'' '''83''', no. 5 (2002): 577\u2013586. [http://cs-test.ias.ac.in/cs/Downloads/article_id_083_05_0577_0586_0.pdf PDF]</ref> The method was devised by [[V. Jayadevan]], an [[India|Indian]] [[engineer]]. It can be used instead of DLS method.\n\n==VJD Method==\n[[File:VJD target and normal scores.svg|thumb|320px|VJD System Graphs with Normal and Target Curve]]\n\nVJD method is essentially built around two [[curve]]s. The first curve depicts the \"normal\" run getting pattern; i.e., when there is no interruption and the side is expecting to bat its full quota of overs. The second curve (\"target curve\") indicates how the batting side should \"speed up\" after an interruption.\nThe \"normal\" curve takes into account both the percentage of [[overs]] played and the percentage of [[wickets]] lost. The \"target\" curve, which is used to set revised targets, only considers the percentage of overs played.\n\n===Obtaining the curves===\n\nTo obtain the normal score curve VJD System considers the percentage of [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored in seven phases: settling down (first 10% of the overs, i.e. the five overs), exploiting [[field restrictions]] (next 20% of the overs, i.e. overs 6\u201315), stabilising the innings-I (next 20%; overs 16\u201325), stabilising the innings-II (next 10%; overs 26\u201330), beginning the acceleration (next 20%; overs 31\u201340), secondary stage of acceleration (next 10%; overs 41\u201345) and final slog (last 10%; overs 46\u201350). The normal score curve is then obtained by fitting a suitable regression equation for the cumulative overs % and the corresponding cumulative [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored %.\n\nVJD System obtains the target score by looking at the percentage of runs scored in each of the seven scoring phases, arranges them in descending order of run productivity, and again obtains a regression fit for [[cumulative]] overs % versus the juxtaposed cumulative [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored %.\n\nThe table has twelve columns: overs percentage, \"target runs\" Gokul percentage and \"normal runs\" percentage, corresponding to 0\u20139 [[wickets]] fallen. For [[overs]] played before an interruption, values are read from the normal runs columns. After an interruption, the \"target runs\" column is used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50em;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Overs % !! rowspan=\"2\" | Target run % !! colspan=\"10\" | Normal runs % for wicket fall\n|-\n! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9\n|-\n| 20 || 29.8 || 16.9 || 20.6 || 22.6 || 35.0 || 50.0 || 60.0 || 70.0 || 79.0 || 87.0 || 95.0\n|-\n| 40 || 53.5 || 32.4 || 34.5 || 36.5 || 39.7 || 50.0 || 60.0 || 70.0 || 79.0 || 87.0 || 95.0\n|-\n| 50 || 63.4 || 40.4 || 41.7 || 43.0 || 44.3 || 51.9 || 60.0 || 70.0 || 79.0 || 87.0 || 95.0\n|-\n| 60 || 72.3 || 49.2 || 50.1 || 51.1 || 51.4 || 57.9 || 64.6 || 70.0 || 79.0 || 87.0 || 95.0\n|-\n| 80 || 87.6 || 70.7 || 70.8 || 70.9 || 71.0 || 71.2 || 77.1 || 82.4 || 84.3 || 87.0 || 95.0\n|}\n\nFor example. If Team 1 score 280 runs in 50 [[overs]]. During the break, there is a shower and Team 2 can only bat for 40 overs. Following the interruption, Team 2 must [[bat]] for 40 overs out of 50, i.e. 80% of the overs. Using the VJD table, the \"target [[run (cricket)|run]]\" % corresponding to 80% overs is 87.6%. So Team 2 must score 246 (280 x 87.6%) runs to win.\n\n==Use in national and international cricket==\nOn 13 December 2010, it was reported that the BCCI had decided<ref>http://cricket.ndtv.com/storypage.aspx?id=SPOEN20100163148&nid=72389</ref> that Jayadevan's system will be formally used in the [[2011 Indian Premier League|fourth edition]] of [[Indian Premier League]] but it wasn't. The [[Duckworth-Lewis method|Duckworth-Lewis]] system was used in the third season and the fourth season of the league.\n\nThe [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] still uses the Duckworth Lewis method in all international matches. The Jayadevan system has been put before the ICC in the past, but the decision was made to retain the Duckworth-Lewis method.\n\nGenerally speaking, nobody has been able to successfully argue that either the Duckworth-Lewis Method or the Jayadevan System is significantly superior to the other, with most assessments concluding that their performance is reasonably similar.\n\n==Comparison with the Duckworth-Lewis method==\nBoth the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]] and the Jayadevan System use a statistical method to determine what proportion of a team's runs it is expected to have scored, based upon the number of overs faced and the number of wickets lost (traditionally referred to as the ''resources'' available to a team). However, there are two primary differences between the two methods:\n*The mathematical relationship used in the Duckworth Lewis system assumes that a team's scoring rate accelerates throughout the team's innings \u2013 slowly at first, but more rapidly during the final ten to fifteen overs (the \"slog overs\"). Jayadevan's relationship is more empirical than Duckworth-Lewis', and assumes that the scoring rate is faster during the first fifteen to twenty overs during fielding restrictions, decelerates during the middle overs when most teams try to consolidate their innings, and then accelerates again for the slog overs. In this way, Jayadevan tries to improve upon Duckworth-Lewis' notion of the \"typical innings\".\n*Secondly, Duckworth-Lewis is based upon a single set of curves which is used to make all adjustments to the scores. The Jayadevan method has two different curves: the \"normal curves\", which are used to adjust runs already scored by the batting team; and the \"target curve\", which is used to adjust the runs that the batting team is yet to score. Jayadevan's justification for this is that prior to a rain interruption, a team will base its batting tactics on the assumption that it has its full quota of overs available; but, following an interruption, a team can change its batting tactics to suit the new number of overs \u2013 so, if the tactics are inherently different, the curves used to calculate the run targets should also be different.\n\nUnder Jayadevan's method, the \"normal\" curve takes into account both the percentage of overs played and the percentage of wickets lost. The \"target\" curve considers only the percentage of overs played; ''i.e.'' no adjustment is made according to the number of wickets lost.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/may/21srini.htm Comparison with D/L method]\n* [http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/may/21srini1.htm Jayadevan's rain rules for LOI cricket]\n* Jayadevan, V. \"An improved system for the computation of target scores in interrupted limited over cricket matches adding variations in scoring range as another parameter.\" ''Current Science'' '''86''', no. 4 (2004): 515\u2013517.

The first curve depicts the \"normal\" run getting pattern; i.e., when there is no interruption and the side is expecting to bat its full quota of overs. The second curve (\"target curve\") indicates how the batting side should \"speed up\" after an interruption.\nThe \"normal\" curve takes into account both the percentage of [[overs]] played and the percentage of [[wickets]] lost. The \"target\" curve, which is used to set revised targets, only considers the percentage of overs played.\n\n===Obtaining the curves===\n\nTo obtain the normal score curve VJD System considers the percentage of [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored in seven phases: settling down (first 10% of the overs, i.e. the five overs), exploiting [[field restrictions]] (next 20% of the overs, i.e. overs 6\u201315), stabilising the innings-I (next 20%; overs 16\u201325), stabilising the innings-II (next 10%; overs 26\u201330), beginning the acceleration (next 20%; overs 31\u201340), secondary stage of acceleration (next 10%; overs 41\u201345) and final slog (last 10%; overs 46\u201350). The normal score curve is then obtained by fitting a suitable regression equation for the cumulative overs % and the corresponding cumulative [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored %.\n\nVJD System obtains the target score by looking at the percentage of runs scored in each of the seven scoring phases, arranges them in descending order of run productivity, and again obtains a regression fit for [[cumulative]] overs % versus the juxtaposed cumulative [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored %.\n\nThe table has twelve columns: overs percentage, \"target runs\" Gokul percentage and \"normal runs\" percentage, corresponding to 0\u20139 [[wickets]] fallen.
