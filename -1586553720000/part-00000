However, ''Honey to the B'' found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number  31 despite the success of \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\", and in the US, it almost went completely unnoticed, peaking at number  17 on the Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/honey-to-the-b-mw0000664131/awards|title=Honey to the Bee - Billie|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1998 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by [[B*Witched]]) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award).

She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released during mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to \"Because We Want To\" was released in Japan, a single comprising \"Girlfriend\" and \"She Wants You\" combined.

The song \"Walk of Life\", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters.

However, ''Honey to the B'' found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number  31 despite the success of \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\", and in the US, it almost went completely unnoticed, peaking at number  17 on the Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/honey-to-the-b-mw0000664131/awards|title=Honey to the Bee - Billie|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1998 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by [[B*Witched]]) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award). She then released \"[[She Wants You#Billie version|She Wants You]]\" as the third single from the album. The song reached number three. \"Honey to the Bee\" was released as the fourth single from the album; like the previous single, it reached number three. <!--note: the album is ''Honey to the B'', but the song is \"Honey to the Bee.\"-->At the same time, \"She Wants You\" was released in the US, reaching number  9 on the \"Hot Club Dance Play\" chart.\n\nIn 1999, Piper was nominated for two [[BRIT Awards]] and won two awards at the 1999 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, although she was reduced to tears at the latter ceremony after being booed by fans of [[Ritchie Neville]], whom she was dating at the time. She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released during mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to \"Because We Want To\" was released in Japan, a single comprising \"Girlfriend\" and \"She Wants You\" combined. She recorded a song for ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie]]'' titled \"[[Billie Piper discography#Other appearances|Makin' My Way (Any Way That I Can)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pokemon-the-first-movie-mw0000254801|title= Pokemon: The First Movie > Overview|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n====''Walk of Life''====\n[[File:Billie Piper (16) edited.jpg|thumb|Piper in 2004]]\nDuring that time, Piper recorded her second album. She decided to release further records under her full name of Billie Piper. She returned to the Singles Chart in May 2000 with her third number-one single \"[[Day & Night (song)|Day & Night]]\". She waited until September to release \"[[Something Deep Inside]]\", which reached number four, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, ''[[Walk of Life (album)|Walk of Life]]'', which reached #14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified silver in the UK. The album only charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached #17 only, and Australia, where it was a minor success and peaked at #23. In Piper's autobiography, she states that the album was a \"commercial bomb\". The song \"Walk of Life\", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1321339/Billie-Piper-needs-head-cut-off-said-telephone-threats.html |title=Billie Piper 'needs head cut off', said telephone threats |date=6 February 2001 |last=Demetriou |first=Danielle |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> Peters received psychiatric treatment as part of her sentence.

Finding himself suffering [[existential angst]], Qohen constantly waits for a phone call, hoping that it might bring him happiness or the answers he seeks. When Qohen requests a \"disability\" evaluation, three company doctors determine that he is physically healthy, but require he have therapy from Dr Shrink-[[Read-only memory|ROM]], an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] therapist designed to provide mental evaluation. Wanting to meet with \"Management\", Qohen attends a party held by his supervisor, Joby. Stumbling into an empty room, Qohen finds Management and requests to work from home, as he would be more productive and would no longer risk missing his call; Management simply notes he finds Qohen \"quite insane,\" but later grants his request. Qohen is pressed into staying at the party by Joby, but chokes on an olive and is rescued by Bainsley, a partygoer.\n\nAs he begins working from home, Qohen is required to order the data of the Neural Net Mancrive, a massive supercomputer that contains all of the entities crunched by workers, with the goal of solving the \"Zero Theorem\", a mysterious mathematical formula. Qohen spends months as a hermit working on the program, during which he is diagnosed with multiple conditions by Shrink-ROM and begins experiencing nightmares involving a [[black hole]].\n\nFrustrated with his work, Qohen smashes his computer with a hammer, and is soon visited by Bainsley. Qohen confides in Bainsley that he believes he accidentally hung up a call that would have given him the [[meaning of life]], and has desperately been waiting for a call-back ever since. Qohen is then visited by Bob, the teenage son of Management. Bob repairs his computer, reveals Management is spying on him, and suggests that Bainsley is only interested in Qohen because she is paid to be. Bob promises to get Qohen his call if he continues working on the Zero Theorem. Having received a [[Teledildonics|VR]] suit from Bainsley, Qohen interacts with her through virtual reality, which makes them both appear on a beach together. When Qohen asks if the sun in the horizon ever sets, Bainsley responds it is not programmed to do so. They soon kiss one another.\n\nBob visits Qohen again and tells him that the Zero Theorem aims to prove life is meaningless through the [[Big Crunch]] theory. Digitally connecting to Bainsley again, Qohen is comforted by her, but when he denounces Management and suggests eloping together, she forcefully disconnects, damaging Qohen's suit. When Bob takes his suit to repair it, Qohen connects to Bainsley unannounced, only to discover she is a [[Camgirling|webcam stripper]]. Bob returns with Qohen's suit, now repaired, and reveals Qohen's phone call is only a delusion, and admits his Dr. Shrink-ROM was only designed to identify his pathology rather than treat it. Bainsley visits Qohen and apologizes for deceiving him, claiming she truly fell in love with him. Despite Bainsley's offer to elope, which is encouraged by Bob, Qohen turns her down.\n\nQohen discovers Bob's health is radically declining. While caring for Bob, Qohen begins to uncover and smash Management's cameras hidden throughout his home, after which Management employees break in and take Bob away.

Finding himself suffering [[existential angst]], Qohen constantly waits for a phone call, hoping that it might bring him happiness or the answers he seeks. When Qohen requests a \"disability\" evaluation, three company doctors determine that he is physically healthy, but require he have therapy from Dr Shrink-[[Read-only memory|ROM]], an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] therapist designed to provide mental evaluation. Wanting to meet with \"Management\", Qohen attends a party held by his supervisor, Joby. Stumbling into an empty room, Qohen finds Management and requests to work from home, as he would be more productive and would no longer risk missing his call; Management simply notes he finds Qohen \"quite insane,\" but later grants his request. Qohen is pressed into staying at the party by Joby, but chokes on an olive and is rescued by Bainsley, a partygoer.\n\nAs he begins working from home, Qohen is required to order the data of the Neural Net Mancrive, a massive supercomputer that contains all of the entities crunched by workers, with the goal of solving the \"Zero Theorem\", a mysterious mathematical formula. Qohen spends months as a hermit working on the program, during which he is diagnosed with multiple conditions by Shrink-ROM and begins experiencing nightmares involving a [[black hole]].\n\nFrustrated with his work, Qohen smashes his computer with a hammer, and is soon visited by Bainsley. Qohen confides in Bainsley that he believes he accidentally hung up a call that would have given him the [[meaning of life]], and has desperately been waiting for a call-back ever since. Qohen is then visited by Bob, the teenage son of Management. Bob repairs his computer, reveals Management is spying on him, and suggests that Bainsley is only interested in Qohen because she is paid to be. Bob promises to get Qohen his call if he continues working on the Zero Theorem. Having received a [[Teledildonics|VR]] suit from Bainsley, Qohen interacts with her through virtual reality, which makes them both appear on a beach together. When Qohen asks if the sun in the horizon ever sets, Bainsley responds it is not programmed to do so. They soon kiss one another.\n\nBob visits Qohen again and tells him that the Zero Theorem aims to prove life is meaningless through the [[Big Crunch]] theory. Digitally connecting to Bainsley again, Qohen is comforted by her, but when he denounces Management and suggests eloping together, she forcefully disconnects, damaging Qohen's suit. When Bob takes his suit to repair it, Qohen connects to Bainsley unannounced, only to discover she is a [[Camgirling|webcam stripper]]. Bob returns with Qohen's suit, now repaired, and reveals Qohen's phone call is only a delusion, and admits his Dr. Shrink-ROM was only designed to identify his pathology rather than treat it. Bainsley visits Qohen and apologizes for deceiving him, claiming she truly fell in love with him. Despite Bainsley's offer to elope, which is encouraged by Bob, Qohen turns her down.\n\nQohen discovers Bob's health is radically declining. While caring for Bob, Qohen begins to uncover and smash Management's cameras hidden throughout his home, after which Management employees break in and take Bob away. Joby is fired by management as a result of this and visits Qohen to berate him. Qohen dons his now \"repaired\" virtual reality suit and connects to his computer, but is nearly electrocuted.\n\nAppearing at the Neural Net Mancrive, Qohen is greeted by an image of Management, who tells him that Bob is hospitalized due to a chronic illness. Management explains that Qohen is now part of the Neural Net, there is no meaning of life, and there was never a higher power able to grant Qohen his call. Management explains that while the Zero Theorem would prove that everything is meaningless, the entire purpose of Mancom in \"crunching entities\" was to bring order to disorder, finding meaning in some form that he could sell. Management chose Qohen to solve the Zero Theorem because Qohen had faith in finding meaning \u2014 the antithesis of the theorem (and having done nothing but wait for his call, he had lived a meaningless life). Management tells Qohen he no longer needs him and disappears, leading Qohen to smash the Neural Net, collapsing it and revealing a black hole inside. Smiling, Qohen jumps into it, only to appear back on the virtual beach.

Taylor & John Archibald Wheeler (1966 1st ed. only) ''Spacetime Physics'' (W.H. Freeman, San Francisco) {{ISBN|0-7167-0336-X}}, Chapter 1 Exercise 51 page 97-98: \"Clock paradox III\" ([http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf pdf]).</ref> is the physical [[acceleration]] (i.e., measurable acceleration as by an [[accelerometer]]) experienced by an object. It is thus acceleration relative to a [[free-fall]], or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured. Gravitation therefore does not cause proper acceleration, since gravity acts upon the inertial observer that any proper acceleration must depart from. A corollary is that all inertial observers always have a proper acceleration of zero.\n\nProper acceleration contrasts with [[acceleration|coordinate acceleration]], which is dependent on choice of [[coordinate system]]s and thus upon choice of observers (see [[acceleration (special relativity)#Three-acceleration|three-acceleration in special relativity]]).\n\nIn the standard inertial coordinates of special relativity, for unidirectional motion, proper acceleration is the rate of change of [[proper velocity]] with respect to coordinate time.\n\nIn an inertial frame in which the object is momentarily at rest, the proper acceleration 3-vector, combined with a zero time-component, yields the object's [[four-acceleration]], which makes proper-acceleration's magnitude [[Lorentz invariant|Lorentz-invariant]]. Thus the concept is useful: (i) with accelerated coordinate systems, (ii) at relativistic speeds, and (iii) in curved spacetime.\n\nIn an accelerating rocket after launch, or even in a rocket standing at the gantry, the proper acceleration is the acceleration felt by the occupants, and which is described as [[g-force]] (which is ''not'' a force but rather an acceleration; see that article for more discussion of proper acceleration) delivered by the vehicle only.<ref>Relativity By Wolfgang Rindler pg 71</ref> The \"acceleration of gravity\" (\"force of gravity\") never contributes to proper acceleration in any circumstances, and thus the proper acceleration felt by observers standing on the ground is due to the mechanical force ''from the ground'', not due to the \"force\" or \"acceleration\" of gravity. If the ground is removed and the observer allowed to free-fall, the observer will experience coordinate acceleration, but no proper acceleration, and thus no g-force. Generally, objects in such a fall or generally any such ballistic path (also called inertial motion), including objects in orbit, experience no proper acceleration (neglecting small tidal accelerations for inertial paths in gravitational fields). This state is also known as \"zero gravity\" (\"zero-g\") or \"free-fall,\" and it produces a sensation of [[weightlessness]].\n\nProper acceleration reduces to coordinate acceleration in an inertial coordinate system in flat spacetime (i.e. in the absence of gravity), provided the magnitude of the object's proper-velocity<ref>Francis W. Sears & Robert W. Brehme (1968) ''Introduction to the theory of relativity'' (Addison-Wesley, NY) [http://catalog.loc.gov/webvoy.htm LCCN 680019344], section 7-3</ref> (momentum per unit mass) is much less than the speed of light ''c''. Only in such situations is coordinate acceleration ''entirely'' felt as a g-force (i.e. a proper acceleration, also defined as one that produces measurable weight).\n\nIn situations in which gravitation is absent but the chosen coordinate system is not inertial, but is accelerated with the observer (such as the accelerated reference frame of an accelerating rocket, or a frame fixed upon objects in a centrifuge), then g-forces and corresponding proper accelerations felt by observers in these coordinate systems are caused by the mechanical forces which resist their [[weight]] in such systems. This weight, in turn, is produced by [[fictitious force]]s or \"inertial forces\" which appear in all such accelerated coordinate systems, in a manner somewhat like the weight produced by the \"force of gravity\" in systems where objects are fixed in space with regard to the gravitating body (as on the surface of the Earth).\n\nThe total (mechanical) force that is calculated to induce the proper acceleration on a mass at rest in a coordinate system that has a proper acceleration, via Newton's law '''F''' = ''m'' '''a''', is called the '''proper force'''. As seen above, the proper force is equal to the opposing reaction force that is measured as an object's \"operational weight\" (i.e. its weight as measured by a device like a spring scale, in vacuum, in the object's coordinate system). Thus, the proper force on an object is always equal and opposite to its measured weight.\n\n==Examples==\n\nWhen holding onto a carousel that turns at constant [[angular velocity]] you experience a radially inward ([[centripetal acceleration|centripetal]]) proper-acceleration due to the interaction between the handhold and your hand.  This cancels the radially outward ''geometric acceleration'' associated with your [[Rotating reference frame|spinning coordinate frame]].  This outward acceleration (from the spinning frame's perspective) will become the coordinate acceleration when you let go, causing you to fly off along a zero proper-acceleration ([[geodesic]]) path.  Unaccelerated observers, of course, in their frame simply see your equal proper and coordinate accelerations vanish when you let go.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' lost grip on a carousel\n|-\n|[[File:Spinframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and spin frame perspectives of proper (red) and geometric (blue) accelerations for an object released from a carousel.]]\nFrom the map frame perspective, what's dangerous is your tangential velocity.  From the spin frame perspective, the danger instead may lie with that geometric acceleration.\n|}\n\nSimilarly, standing on a non-rotating planet (and on earth for practical purposes) we experience an upward proper-acceleration due to the [[normal force]] exerted by the earth on the bottom of our shoes.  This cancels the downward geometric acceleration due to our choice of coordinate system (a so-called shell-frame<ref name=\"TaylorWheeler2003\">Edwin F. Taylor and John Archibald Wheeler (2000) ''Exploring black holes'' (Addison Wesley Longman, NY) {{ISBN|0-201-38423-X}}</ref>).  That downward acceleration becomes coordinate if we inadvertently step off a cliff into a zero proper-acceleration (geodesic or rain-frame) trajectory.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' ball that rolls off a cliff\n|-\n|[[File:Shellframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Rain and shell frame perspectives of proper (red) and geometric (blue) accelerations for an object that rolls off a cliff.]] ''Note:'' The rain frame perspective, rather than being that of a raindrop, is more like that of a trampoline jumper whose trajectory tops out just as the ball reaches the edge of the cliff.  The shell frame perspective may be familiar to planet dwellers who rely minute by minute on upward physical accelerations from their environment, to protect them from that geometric acceleration due to curved spacetime.  No wonder micro-gravity environments may seem scary to them at first.\n|}\n\nNote that ''geometric accelerations'' (due to the [[affine connection|connection]] term in the coordinate system's [[covariant derivative]] below) act on ''every ounce of our being'', while proper-accelerations are usually caused by an external force.  Introductory physics courses often treat gravity's downward (geometric) acceleration as due to a [[Gravitational force|mass-proportional force]].  This, along with diligent avoidance of unaccelerated frames, allows them to treat proper and coordinate acceleration as the same thing.\n\nEven then if an object maintains a ''constant proper-acceleration'' from rest over an extended period in flat spacetime, observers in the rest frame will see the object's coordinate acceleration decrease as its coordinate velocity approaches lightspeed.  The rate at which the object's proper-velocity goes up, nevertheless, remains constant.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' high speed trip up then down\n|-\n|[[File:Tripframe.gif|thumb|201px|center|Map-frame perspective of proper (red) and ''coordinate'' (green) accelerations/decelerations in the vertical direction.]]\nHere our object first accelerates upward for a time period of 2*c/\u03b1 on traveler clocks, \nwhere c is lightspeed and \u03b1 is the (red) proper acceleration's magnitude.  This first leg takes about 2 years if the acceleration's magnitude is about 1-gee.  It then accelerates downward (first slowing and then speeding up) over twice that period, followed by a 2*c/\u03b1 upward deceleration to return to the original height.  Note that the coordinate acceleration (green) is significant only during the low-speed segments of this voyage.\n|}\n\nThus the distinction between proper-acceleration and coordinate acceleration<ref name=\"MisnerThorneWheeler\">cf. C. W. Misner, K. S. Thorne and J. A. Wheeler (1973) ''Gravitation'' (W. H. Freeman, NY) {{ISBN|978-0-7167-0344-0}}, section 1.6</ref> allows one to track the experience of accelerated travelers from various non-Newtonian perspectives.  These perspectives include those of accelerated coordinate systems (like a carousel), of high speeds (where proper and coordinate times differ), and of curved spacetime (like that associated with gravity on Earth).\n\n==Classical applications==\n\nAt low speeds in the [[inertial reference frame|inertial coordinate systems]] of [[Newton's Laws|Newtonian physics]], proper acceleration simply equals the coordinate acceleration '''a'''=d<sup>2</sup>'''x'''/dt<sup>2</sup>.  As reviewed above, however, it differs from coordinate acceleration if one chooses (against Newton's advice) to describe the world from the perspective of an accelerated coordinate system like a motor vehicle accelerating from rest, or a stone being spun around in a slingshot.  If one chooses to recognize that gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime (see below), proper acceleration differs from coordinate acceleration in a [[gravitational field]].\n\nFor example, an object subjected to physical or proper acceleration '''a'''<sub>o</sub> will be seen by observers in a coordinate system undergoing constant acceleration '''a'''<sub>frame</sub> to have coordinate acceleration:\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{acc} = \\vec{a}_{o} - \\vec{a}_{frame}</math>.\nThus if the object is accelerating with the frame, observers fixed to the frame will see no acceleration at all.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' driving from block to block\n|-\n|[[File:Carframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and car frame perspectives of physical (red) and geometric (blue) accelerations for a car driving from one stop sign to the next.]]\nIn this illustration the car accelerates after a stop sign until midway up the block, at which point the driver is immediately off the accelerator and onto the brake so as to make the next stop. \n|}\n\nSimilarly, an object undergoing physical or proper acceleration '''a'''<sub>o</sub> will be seen by observers in a frame rotating with angular velocity '''\u03c9''' to have coordinate acceleration:\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{rot} = \n\\vec{a}_{o} - \\vec\\omega \\times (\\vec\\omega \\times   \\vec{r} ) - 2 \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{v}_{rot} - \\frac{d \\vec\\omega}{dt} \\times \\vec{r}\n</math>.\nIn the equation above, there are three geometric acceleration terms on the right-hand side.  The first \"centrifugal acceleration\" term depends only on the radial position '''r''' and not the velocity of our object, the second \"Coriolis acceleration\" term depends only on the object's velocity in the rotating frame '''v'''<sub>rot</sub> but not its position, and the third \"Euler acceleration\" term depends only on position and the rate of change of the frame's angular velocity.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Newtonian example:'' constant speed slingshot\n|-\n|[[File:Cforces.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and spin frame perspectives of accelerations and forces associated with a stone released after being spun around on a massless rope.]]\nForces ''on the stone'' include the inward centripetal (red) force seen in both frames, as well as the geometric (blue) force seen in the spin frame.  Before the stone is released, the blue geometric force is purely centrifugal (pointing radially outward), while after release the geometric force is a sum of centrifugal and Coriolis components.\n\nNote that after release in the spin frame that the centrifugal component (light blue) is always radial, while the Coriolis component (green) is always perpendicular to spin frame velocity.   Also seen in both frames is the force ''on the rope's anchor point'' (magenta) caused by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's 3rd Law]] action-reaction to the centripetal force on the stone.\n\n===Before projectile launch===\nThe following alternate analyses of motion ''before'' the stone is released consider only forces acting in the radial direction.  Both analyses predict that string tension ''T''=''mv''<sup>2</sup>/''r''.  For example, if the radius of the sling is ''r''=1 metre, the velocity of the stone in the map frame is ''v''=25 metres per second, and the stone's mass ''m''=0.2 kilogram, then the tension in the string will be 125 newtons.\n\n*'''Map frame story before launch'''\n:<math>-T_{centripetal}=\\Sigma F_{radial} = m a_{radial} = - m \\frac{v^2}{r}.</math>\nHere the stone is seen to be continually accelerated inward so as to follow a circular path of radius r.  The inward radial acceleration of a<sub>radial</sub>=v<sup>2</sup>/r is caused by a single ''unbalanced'' centripetal force T.  The fact that the tension force is unbalanced means that, in this frame, the centrifugal (radially-outward) force on the stone is zero.  \n*'''Spin frame story before launch'''\n:<math>m \\frac{v^2}{r} - T_{centripetal}=\\Sigma F_{rot} = m a_{rot} = 0.</math>\nFrom the spin frame perspective the stone may be said to experience balanced inward centripetal (''T'') and outward centrifugal (''mv''<sup>2</sup>/''r'') forces, which result in no acceleration at all ''from the perspective of that frame''.  Unlike the centripetal force, the frame-dependent centrifugal force acts on every bit of the circling stone much as gravity acts on every ounce of you.  Moreover, the centrifugal force magnitude is proportional to the stone's mass so that, if allowed to cause acceleration, the acceleration would be mass-independent.\n\n===After projectile launch===\nAfter the stone is released, in the spin frame both centripetal and Coriolis forces act in a delocalized way on all parts of the stone with accelerations that are independent of the stone's mass.  By comparison in the map frame, after release no forces are acting on the projectile at all.  \n|}\n\nIn each of these cases, physical or proper acceleration differs from coordinate acceleration because the latter can be affected by your choice of coordinate system as well as by physical forces acting on the object.  Those components of coordinate acceleration ''not'' caused by physical forces (like direct contact or electrostatic attraction) are often attributed (as in the Newtonian example above) to forces that: (i) act on every ounce of the object, (ii) cause mass-independent accelerations, and (iii) don't exist from all points of view.   Such geometric (or improper) forces include [[Coriolis force|Coriolis]] forces, [[Euler force|Euler]] forces, [[g force|g-forces]], [[centrifugal force]]s and (as we see below) [[gravity]] forces as well.\n\n==Viewed from a flat spacetime slice==\n{{main|proper reference frame (flat spacetime)}}\n\n[[File:FlatSpaceEquations.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Proper-frame dynamics in (1+1)D spacetime.]]\n\nProper-acceleration's relationships to coordinate acceleration in a specified slice of flat spacetime follow<ref>P.

At low speeds this reduces to the [[Equation of motion|well-known relation]] between coordinate [[velocity]] and coordinate acceleration times map-time, i.e. \u0394''v''=''a''\u0394''t''.\n\nFor constant unidirectional proper-acceleration, similar relationships exist between [[rapidity]] ''\u03b7'' and elapsed proper time \u0394''\u03c4'', as well as between Lorentz factor ''\u03b3'' and distance traveled \u0394''x''.

For example, imagine a spaceship that can accelerate its passengers at \"1 gee\" (10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 light year per year squared) halfway to their destination, and then decelerate them at \"1 gee\" for the remaining half so as to provide earth-like artificial gravity from point A to point B over the shortest possible time.<ref>E.

Unfortunately, sustaining 1-gee acceleration for years is easier said than done, as illustrated by the maximum payload to launch mass ratios shown in the figure at right.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' roundtrip to a star 6.9 ly away\n|-\n|[[File:Tripframe2.gif|thumb|396px|center|Map and traveler perspectives of a roundtrip at constant 1 gee proper-acceleration (red arrow in the traveler frame) between the sun (yellow) and a hypothetical star (cyan) 6.9 lightyears away.

After each round trip ship-pilots on this shuttle-run will have aged only half as much as colleagues stationed on earth. This is [[time dilation]] in action.\n\nOther differences include the distance changes between co-moving stars, seen in the traveler frame. This is [[length contraction]] in action.  Coordinate acceleration (green) seen in the map frame is only significant in the year before and after each launch, while the proper-acceleration (red) felt by the traveler is significant throughout the voyage.\n\nNote also the trace of a light signal initiated from each launch point, but 0.886 map years after launch. This pulse reaches the traveler at the voyage midpoint to remind them to begin deceleration. In the map frame Proxima Centauri sees the turnaround pulse before the destination star does, but the converse is true in the traveler frame.  This is [[Relativity of simultaneity|relative simultaneity]] in action.  Nonetheless both observers agree on the sequence of events along any time-like world line. \n|}\n\n==In curved spacetime==\n\nIn the language of [[general relativity]], the components of an object's acceleration four-vector ''A'' (whose magnitude is proper acceleration) are related to elements of the [[four-velocity]] via a [[covariant derivative]] ''D'' with respect to proper time \u03c4:\n\n:<math>A^\\lambda := \\frac{DU^\\lambda }{d\\tau} = \\frac{dU^\\lambda }{d\\tau } + \\Gamma^\\lambda {}_{\\mu \\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu </math>\n\nHere ''U'' is the object's [[four-velocity]], and ''\u0393'' represents the coordinate system's 64 connection coefficients or [[Christoffel symbols]].  Note that the Greek subscripts take on four possible values, namely 0 for the time-axis and 1-3 for spatial coordinate axes, and that repeated indices are used to indicate [[summation convention|summation]] over all values of that index.  Trajectories with zero proper acceleration are referred to as [[geodesic]]s.\n\nThe left hand side of this set of four equations (one each for the time-like and three spacelike values of index \u03bb) is the object's proper-acceleration 3-vector combined with a null time component as seen from the vantage point of a reference or book-keeper coordinate system in which the object is at rest.  The first term on the right hand side lists the rate at which the time-like (energy/''mc'') and space-like (momentum/''m'') components of the object's four-velocity ''U'' change, per unit time ''\u03c4'' on traveler clocks.\n\nLet's solve for that first term on the right since at low speeds its spacelike components represent the coordinate acceleration.  More generally, when that first term goes to zero the object's coordinate acceleration goes to zero.  This yields...\n\n:<math>\\frac{dU^\\lambda }{d\\tau } =A^\\lambda - \\Gamma^\\lambda {}_{\\mu \\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu</math>.\n\nThus, as exemplified with the first two animations above, coordinate acceleration goes to zero whenever proper-acceleration is exactly canceled by the connection (or ''geometric acceleration'') term on the far right.<ref>cf. R. J. Cook (2004) Physical time and physical space in general relativity, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''72''':214-219</ref>  ''Caution:''  This term may be a sum of as many as sixteen separate velocity and position dependent terms, since the repeated indices ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03bd'' are by convention summed over all pairs of their four allowed values.\n\n===Force and equivalence===\n\nThe above equation also offers some perspective on forces and the [[equivalence principle]].  Consider ''local'' book-keeper coordinates<ref name=\"TaylorWheeler2003\" /> for the metric (e.g. a local Lorentz tetrad<ref name=\"MisnerThorneWheeler\" /> like that which [[global positioning system]]s provide information on) to describe time in seconds, and space in distance units along perpendicular axes.  If we multiply the above equation by the traveling object's rest mass m, and divide by Lorentz factor ''\u03b3''&nbsp;= d''t''/d''\u03c4'', the spacelike components express the rate of momentum change for that object from the perspective of the coordinates used to describe the metric.\n\nThis in turn can be broken down into parts due to proper and geometric components of acceleration and force.  If we further multiply the time-like component by lightspeed ''c'', and define coordinate velocity as '''v'''&nbsp;= d'''x'''/d''t'', we get an expression for rate of energy change as well:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dE}{dt}=\\vec{v}\\cdot\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}</math> (timelike) and <math>\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}=\\Sigma\\vec{f_o}+\\Sigma\\vec{f_g}=m(\\vec{a_o}+\\vec{a_g}) </math> (spacelike).\n\nHere ''a''<sub>''o''</sub> is an acceleration due to proper forces and ''a''<sub>''g''</sub> is, by default, a geometric acceleration that we see applied to the object because of our coordinate system choice.   At low speeds these accelerations combine to generate a coordinate acceleration like '''a'''=d<sup>2</sup>'''x'''/d''t''<sup>2</sup>, while for unidirectional motion ''at any speed'' ''a''<sub>''o''</sub>'s magnitude is that of proper acceleration ''\u03b1'' as in the section above where ''\u03b1''&nbsp;= ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>''a'' when ''a''<sub>''g''</sub> is zero.  In general expressing these accelerations and forces can be complicated.\n\nNonetheless if we use this breakdown to describe the connection coefficient (\u0393) term above in terms of geometric forces, then the motion of objects from the point of view of ''any coordinate system'' (at least at low speeds) can be seen as locally Newtonian.  This is already common practice e.g. with centrifugal force and gravity.  Thus the equivalence principle extends the local usefulness of Newton's laws to accelerated coordinate systems and beyond.\n\n===Surface dwellers on a planet===\n\nFor low speed observers being held at fixed radius from the center of a spherical planet or star, coordinate acceleration '''a'''<sub>shell</sub> is approximately related to proper acceleration '''a'''<sub>o</sub> by:\n\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{shell} = \\vec{a}_o - \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r-r_s}} \\frac{G M}{r^2} \\hat{r} </math>\n\nwhere the planet or star's [[Schwarzschild radius]] r<sub>s</sub>=2GM/c<sup>2</sup>.  As our shell observer's radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius, the proper acceleration a<sub>o</sub> needed to keep it from falling in becomes intolerable.\n\nOn the other hand, for r>>r<sub>s</sub>, an upward proper force of only GMm/r<sup>2</sup> is needed to prevent one from accelerating downward.  At the Earth's surface this becomes:\n\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{shell} = \\vec{a}_o - g \\hat{r}</math>\n\nwhere g is the downward 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration due to gravity, and <math>\\hat{r}</math> is a unit vector in the radially outward direction from the center of the gravitating body.  Thus here an outward proper force of mg is needed to keep one from accelerating downward.\n\n===Four-vector derivations===\n\nThe spacetime equations of this section allow one to address ''all deviations'' between proper and coordinate acceleration in a single calculation. For example, let's calculate the [[Christoffel symbols]]:<ref>Hartle, James B. (2003). Gravity: an Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity.

Forming the same 4-vector sum as above for the case of d''\u03b8''/d''\u03c4'' and d''r''/d''\u03c4'' zero yields nothing more than the classical acceleration for rotational motion given above, i.e. <math>A^\\lambda = \\Gamma^\\lambda {}_{\\mu \\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu = \\{0,-r(d\\phi/d\\tau)^2,0,0\\}</math> so that ''a''<sub>o</sub>=''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>''r''.

It is thus acceleration relative to a [[free-fall]], or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured. Gravitation therefore does not cause proper acceleration, since gravity acts upon the inertial observer that any proper acceleration must depart from. A corollary is that all inertial observers always have a proper acceleration of zero.\n\nProper acceleration contrasts with [[acceleration|coordinate acceleration]], which is dependent on choice of [[coordinate system]]s and thus upon choice of observers (see [[acceleration (special relativity)#Three-acceleration|three-acceleration in special relativity]]).\n\nIn the standard inertial coordinates of special relativity, for unidirectional motion, proper acceleration is the rate of change of [[proper velocity]] with respect to coordinate time.\n\nIn an inertial frame in which the object is momentarily at rest, the proper acceleration 3-vector, combined with a zero time-component, yields the object's [[four-acceleration]], which makes proper-acceleration's magnitude [[Lorentz invariant|Lorentz-invariant]]. Thus the concept is useful: (i) with accelerated coordinate systems, (ii) at relativistic speeds, and (iii) in curved spacetime.\n\nIn an accelerating rocket after launch, or even in a rocket standing at the gantry, the proper acceleration is the acceleration felt by the occupants, and which is described as [[g-force]] (which is ''not'' a force but rather an acceleration; see that article for more discussion of proper acceleration) delivered by the vehicle only.<ref>Relativity By Wolfgang Rindler pg 71</ref> The \"acceleration of gravity\" (\"force of gravity\") never contributes to proper acceleration in any circumstances, and thus the proper acceleration felt by observers standing on the ground is due to the mechanical force ''from the ground'', not due to the \"force\" or \"acceleration\" of gravity. If the ground is removed and the observer allowed to free-fall, the observer will experience coordinate acceleration, but no proper acceleration, and thus no g-force. Generally, objects in such a fall or generally any such ballistic path (also called inertial motion), including objects in orbit, experience no proper acceleration (neglecting small tidal accelerations for inertial paths in gravitational fields). This state is also known as \"zero gravity\" (\"zero-g\") or \"free-fall,\" and it produces a sensation of [[weightlessness]].\n\nProper acceleration reduces to coordinate acceleration in an inertial coordinate system in flat spacetime (i.e. in the absence of gravity), provided the magnitude of the object's proper-velocity<ref>Francis W. Sears & Robert W. Brehme (1968) ''Introduction to the theory of relativity'' (Addison-Wesley, NY) [http://catalog.loc.gov/webvoy.htm LCCN 680019344], section 7-3</ref> (momentum per unit mass) is much less than the speed of light ''c''. Only in such situations is coordinate acceleration ''entirely'' felt as a g-force (i.e. a proper acceleration, also defined as one that produces measurable weight).\n\nIn situations in which gravitation is absent but the chosen coordinate system is not inertial, but is accelerated with the observer (such as the accelerated reference frame of an accelerating rocket, or a frame fixed upon objects in a centrifuge), then g-forces and corresponding proper accelerations felt by observers in these coordinate systems are caused by the mechanical forces which resist their [[weight]] in such systems. This weight, in turn, is produced by [[fictitious force]]s or \"inertial forces\" which appear in all such accelerated coordinate systems, in a manner somewhat like the weight produced by the \"force of gravity\" in systems where objects are fixed in space with regard to the gravitating body (as on the surface of the Earth).\n\nThe total (mechanical) force that is calculated to induce the proper acceleration on a mass at rest in a coordinate system that has a proper acceleration, via Newton's law '''F''' = ''m'' '''a''', is called the '''proper force'''. As seen above, the proper force is equal to the opposing reaction force that is measured as an object's \"operational weight\" (i.e. its weight as measured by a device like a spring scale, in vacuum, in the object's coordinate system). Thus, the proper force on an object is always equal and opposite to its measured weight.\n\n==Examples==\n\nWhen holding onto a carousel that turns at constant [[angular velocity]] you experience a radially inward ([[centripetal acceleration|centripetal]]) proper-acceleration due to the interaction between the handhold and your hand.  This cancels the radially outward ''geometric acceleration'' associated with your [[Rotating reference frame|spinning coordinate frame]].  This outward acceleration (from the spinning frame's perspective) will become the coordinate acceleration when you let go, causing you to fly off along a zero proper-acceleration ([[geodesic]]) path.  Unaccelerated observers, of course, in their frame simply see your equal proper and coordinate accelerations vanish when you let go.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' lost grip on a carousel\n|-\n|[[File:Spinframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and spin frame perspectives of proper (red) and geometric (blue) accelerations for an object released from a carousel.]]\nFrom the map frame perspective, what's dangerous is your tangential velocity.

This cancels the downward geometric acceleration due to our choice of coordinate system (a so-called shell-frame<ref name=\"TaylorWheeler2003\">Edwin F. Taylor and John Archibald Wheeler (2000) ''Exploring black holes'' (Addison Wesley Longman, NY) {{ISBN|0-201-38423-X}}</ref>).

The shell frame perspective may be familiar to planet dwellers who rely minute by minute on upward physical accelerations from their environment, to protect them from that geometric acceleration due to curved spacetime.  No wonder micro-gravity environments may seem scary to them at first.\n|}\n\nNote that ''geometric accelerations'' (due to the [[affine connection|connection]] term in the coordinate system's [[covariant derivative]] below) act on ''every ounce of our being'', while proper-accelerations are usually caused by an external force.  Introductory physics courses often treat gravity's downward (geometric) acceleration as due to a [[Gravitational force|mass-proportional force]].  This, along with diligent avoidance of unaccelerated frames, allows them to treat proper and coordinate acceleration as the same thing.\n\nEven then if an object maintains a ''constant proper-acceleration'' from rest over an extended period in flat spacetime, observers in the rest frame will see the object's coordinate acceleration decrease as its coordinate velocity approaches lightspeed.  The rate at which the object's proper-velocity goes up, nevertheless, remains constant.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' high speed trip up then down\n|-\n|[[File:Tripframe.gif|thumb|201px|center|Map-frame perspective of proper (red) and ''coordinate'' (green) accelerations/decelerations in the vertical direction.]]\nHere our object first accelerates upward for a time period of 2*c/\u03b1 on traveler clocks, \nwhere c is lightspeed and \u03b1 is the (red) proper acceleration's magnitude.  This first leg takes about 2 years if the acceleration's magnitude is about 1-gee.  It then accelerates downward (first slowing and then speeding up) over twice that period, followed by a 2*c/\u03b1 upward deceleration to return to the original height.  Note that the coordinate acceleration (green) is significant only during the low-speed segments of this voyage.\n|}\n\nThus the distinction between proper-acceleration and coordinate acceleration<ref name=\"MisnerThorneWheeler\">cf. C. W. Misner, K. S. Thorne and J. A. Wheeler (1973) ''Gravitation'' (W. H. Freeman, NY) {{ISBN|978-0-7167-0344-0}}, section 1.6</ref> allows one to track the experience of accelerated travelers from various non-Newtonian perspectives.  These perspectives include those of accelerated coordinate systems (like a carousel), of high speeds (where proper and coordinate times differ), and of curved spacetime (like that associated with gravity on Earth).\n\n\n==Classical applications==\n\nAt low speeds in the [[inertial reference frame|inertial coordinate systems]] of [[Newton's Laws|Newtonian physics]], proper acceleration simply equals the coordinate acceleration '''a'''=d<sup>2</sup>'''x'''/dt<sup>2</sup>.  As reviewed above, however, it differs from coordinate acceleration if one chooses (against Newton's advice) to describe the world from the perspective of an accelerated coordinate system like a motor vehicle accelerating from rest, or a stone being spun around in a slingshot.  If one chooses to recognize that gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime (see below), proper acceleration differs from coordinate acceleration in a [[gravitational field]].\n\nFor example, an object subjected to physical or proper acceleration '''a'''<sub>o</sub> will be seen by observers in a coordinate system undergoing constant acceleration '''a'''<sub>frame</sub> to have coordinate acceleration:\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{acc} = \\vec{a}_{o} - \\vec{a}_{frame}</math>.\nThus if the object is accelerating with the frame, observers fixed to the frame will see no acceleration at all.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' driving from block to block\n|-\n|[[File:Carframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and car frame perspectives of physical (red) and geometric (blue) accelerations for a car driving from one stop sign to the next.]]\nIn this illustration the car accelerates after a stop sign until midway up the block, at which point the driver is immediately off the accelerator and onto the brake so as to make the next stop. \n|}\n\nSimilarly, an object undergoing physical or proper acceleration '''a'''<sub>o</sub> will be seen by observers in a frame rotating with angular velocity '''\u03c9''' to have coordinate acceleration:\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{rot} = \n\\vec{a}_{o} - \\vec\\omega \\times (\\vec\\omega \\times   \\vec{r} ) - 2 \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec{v}_{rot} - \\frac{d \\vec\\omega}{dt} \\times \\vec{r}\n</math>.\nIn the equation above, there are three geometric acceleration terms on the right-hand side.  The first \"centrifugal acceleration\" term depends only on the radial position '''r''' and not the velocity of our object, the second \"Coriolis acceleration\" term depends only on the object's velocity in the rotating frame '''v'''<sub>rot</sub> but not its position, and the third \"Euler acceleration\" term depends only on position and the rate of change of the frame's angular velocity.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Newtonian example:'' constant speed slingshot\n|-\n|[[File:Cforces.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and spin frame perspectives of accelerations and forces associated with a stone released after being spun around on a massless rope.]]\nForces ''on the stone'' include the inward centripetal (red) force seen in both frames, as well as the geometric (blue) force seen in the spin frame.  Before the stone is released, the blue geometric force is purely centrifugal (pointing radially outward), while after release the geometric force is a sum of centrifugal and Coriolis components.\n\nNote that after release in the spin frame that the centrifugal component (light blue) is always radial, while the Coriolis component (green) is always perpendicular to spin frame velocity.   Also seen in both frames is the force ''on the rope's anchor point'' (magenta) caused by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's 3rd Law]] action-reaction to the centripetal force on the stone.\n\n===Before projectile launch===\nThe following alternate analyses of motion ''before'' the stone is released consider only forces acting in the radial direction.  Both analyses predict that string tension ''T''=''mv''<sup>2</sup>/''r''.  For example, if the radius of the sling is ''r''=1 metre, the velocity of the stone in the map frame is ''v''=25 metres per second, and the stone's mass ''m''=0.2 kilogram, then the tension in the string will be 125 newtons.\n\n*'''Map frame story before launch'''\n:<math>-T_{centripetal}=\\Sigma F_{radial} = m a_{radial} = - m \\frac{v^2}{r}.</math>\nHere the stone is seen to be continually accelerated inward so as to follow a circular path of radius r.  The inward radial acceleration of a<sub>radial</sub>=v<sup>2</sup>/r is caused by a single ''unbalanced'' centripetal force T.  The fact that the tension force is unbalanced means that, in this frame, the centrifugal (radially-outward) force on the stone is zero.  \n*'''Spin frame story before launch'''\n:<math>m \\frac{v^2}{r} - T_{centripetal}=\\Sigma F_{rot} = m a_{rot} = 0.</math>\nFrom the spin frame perspective the stone may be said to experience balanced inward centripetal (''T'') and outward centrifugal (''mv''<sup>2</sup>/''r'') forces, which result in no acceleration at all ''from the perspective of that frame''.  Unlike the centripetal force, the frame-dependent centrifugal force acts on every bit of the circling stone much as gravity acts on every ounce of you.  Moreover, the centrifugal force magnitude is proportional to the stone's mass so that, if allowed to cause acceleration, the acceleration would be mass-independent.\n\n===After projectile launch===\nAfter the stone is released, in the spin frame both centripetal and Coriolis forces act in a delocalized way on all parts of the stone with accelerations that are independent of the stone's mass.  By comparison in the map frame, after release no forces are acting on the projectile at all.  \n|}\n\nIn each of these cases, physical or proper acceleration differs from coordinate acceleration because the latter can be affected by your choice of coordinate system as well as by physical forces acting on the object.  Those components of coordinate acceleration ''not'' caused by physical forces (like direct contact or electrostatic attraction) are often attributed (as in the Newtonian example above) to forces that: (i) act on every ounce of the object, (ii) cause mass-independent accelerations, and (iii) don't exist from all points of view.   Such geometric (or improper) forces include [[Coriolis force|Coriolis]] forces, [[Euler force|Euler]] forces, [[g force|g-forces]], [[centrifugal force]]s and (as we see below) [[gravity]] forces as well.\n\n==Viewed from a flat spacetime slice==\n{{main|proper reference frame (flat spacetime)}}\n\n[[File:FlatSpaceEquations.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Proper-frame dynamics in (1+1)D spacetime.]]\n\nProper-acceleration's relationships to coordinate acceleration in a specified slice of flat spacetime follow<ref>P.

Here a single reference frame of yardsticks and synchronized clocks define map position '''x''' and map time ''t'' respectively, the traveling object's clocks define [[proper time]] ''\u03c4'', and the \"d\" preceding a coordinate means infinitesimal change.  These relationships allow one to tackle various problems of \"anyspeed engineering\", albeit only from the vantage point of an observer whose extended map frame defines simultaneity.\n\n===Acceleration in (1+1)D===\n\n[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|300px|right|This plot shows how a spaceship capable of 1-gee (10 m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 light year per year squared) acceleration for 100 years might power a trip to most anywhere in the visible universe and back in a lifetime.]]\n\nIn the unidirectional case i.e. when the object's acceleration is parallel or antiparallel to its velocity in the spacetime slice of the observer, proper acceleration '''\u03b1''' and coordinate acceleration '''a''' are related<ref>A. John Mallinckrodt (1999) [http://www.csupomona.edu/~ajm/professional/talks.html What happens when a*t>c?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630231102/http://www.csupomona.edu/~ajm/professional/talks.html |date=2012-06-30 }} (AAPT Summer Meeting, San Antonio TX)</ref> through the [[Lorentz factor]] \u03b3 by '''\u03b1'''=\u03b3<sup>3</sup>'''a'''.  Hence the change in proper-velocity w=dx/d\u03c4 is the integral of proper acceleration over map-time t i.e. \u0394''w''=''\u03b1''\u0394''t'' for constant ''\u03b1''.  At low speeds this reduces to the [[Equation of motion|well-known relation]] between coordinate [[velocity]] and coordinate acceleration times map-time, i.e. \u0394''v''=''a''\u0394''t''.\n\nFor constant unidirectional proper-acceleration, similar relationships exist between [[rapidity]] ''\u03b7'' and elapsed proper time \u0394''\u03c4'', as well as between Lorentz factor ''\u03b3'' and distance traveled \u0394''x''.

For example, imagine a spaceship that can accelerate its passengers at \"1 gee\" (10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 light year per year squared) halfway to their destination, and then decelerate them at \"1 gee\" for the remaining half so as to provide earth-like artificial gravity from point A to point B over the shortest possible time.<ref>E.

Hence the round-trip time on traveler clocks will be \u0394''\u03c4'' = 4(''c''/''\u03b1'') cosh<sup>\u22121</sup>(''\u03b3''<sub>mid</sub>), during which the time elapsed on map clocks will be \u0394''t''&nbsp;= 4(''c''/\u03b1'') sinh[cosh<sup>\u22121</sup>(''\u03b3''<sub>mid</sub>)].\n\nThis imagined spaceship could offer round trips to [[Proxima Centauri]] lasting  about 7.1 traveler years (~12 years on Earth clocks), round trips to the [[Milky Way]]'s central [[black hole]] of about 40 years (~54,000 years elapsed on earth clocks), and round trips to [[Andromeda Galaxy]] lasting around 57 years (over 5 million years on Earth clocks).  Unfortunately, sustaining 1-gee acceleration for years is easier said than done, as illustrated by the maximum payload to launch mass ratios shown in the figure at right.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' roundtrip to a star 6.9 ly away\n|-\n|[[File:Tripframe2.gif|thumb|396px|center|Map and traveler perspectives of a roundtrip at constant 1 gee proper-acceleration (red arrow in the traveler frame) between the sun (yellow) and a hypothetical star (cyan) 6.9 lightyears away.

After each round trip ship-pilots on this shuttle-run will have aged only half as much as colleagues stationed on earth. This is [[time dilation]] in action.\n\nOther differences include the distance changes between co-moving stars, seen in the traveler frame. This is [[length contraction]] in action.  Coordinate acceleration (green) seen in the map frame is only significant in the year before and after each launch, while the proper-acceleration (red) felt by the traveler is significant throughout the voyage.\n\nNote also the trace of a light signal initiated from each launch point, but 0.886 map years after launch. This pulse reaches the traveler at the voyage midpoint to remind them to begin deceleration. In the map frame Proxima Centauri sees the turnaround pulse before the destination star does, but the converse is true in the traveler frame.  This is [[Relativity of simultaneity|relative simultaneity]] in action.  Nonetheless both observers agree on the sequence of events along any time-like world line. \n|}\n\n==In curved spacetime==\n\nIn the language of [[general relativity]], the components of an object's acceleration four-vector ''A'' (whose magnitude is proper acceleration) are related to elements of the [[four-velocity]] via a [[covariant derivative]] ''D'' with respect to proper time \u03c4:\n\n:<math>A^\\lambda := \\frac{DU^\\lambda }{d\\tau} = \\frac{dU^\\lambda }{d\\tau } + \\Gamma^\\lambda {}_{\\mu \\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu </math>\n\nHere ''U'' is the object's [[four-velocity]], and ''\u0393'' represents the coordinate system's 64 connection coefficients or [[Christoffel symbols]].  Note that the Greek subscripts take on four possible values, namely 0 for the time-axis and 1-3 for spatial coordinate axes, and that repeated indices are used to indicate [[summation convention|summation]] over all values of that index.  Trajectories with zero proper acceleration are referred to as [[geodesic]]s.\n\nThe left hand side of this set of four equations (one each for the time-like and three spacelike values of index \u03bb) is the object's proper-acceleration 3-vector combined with a null time component as seen from the vantage point of a reference or book-keeper coordinate system in which the object is at rest.  The first term on the right hand side lists the rate at which the time-like (energy/''mc'') and space-like (momentum/''m'') components of the object's four-velocity ''U'' change, per unit time ''\u03c4'' on traveler clocks.\n\nLet's solve for that first term on the right since at low speeds its spacelike components represent the coordinate acceleration.  More generally, when that first term goes to zero the object's coordinate acceleration goes to zero.  This yields...\n\n:<math>\\frac{dU^\\lambda }{d\\tau } =A^\\lambda - \\Gamma^\\lambda {}_{\\mu \\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu</math>.\n\nThus, as exemplified with the first two animations above, coordinate acceleration goes to zero whenever proper-acceleration is exactly canceled by the connection (or ''geometric acceleration'') term on the far right.<ref>cf. R. J. Cook (2004) Physical time and physical space in general relativity, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''72''':214-219</ref>  ''Caution:''  This term may be a sum of as many as sixteen separate velocity and position dependent terms, since the repeated indices ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03bd'' are by convention summed over all pairs of their four allowed values.\n\n===Force and equivalence===\n\nThe above equation also offers some perspective on forces and the [[equivalence principle]].  Consider ''local'' book-keeper coordinates<ref name=\"TaylorWheeler2003\" /> for the metric (e.g. a local Lorentz tetrad<ref name=\"MisnerThorneWheeler\" /> like that which [[global positioning system]]s provide information on) to describe time in seconds, and space in distance units along perpendicular axes.  If we multiply the above equation by the traveling object's rest mass m, and divide by Lorentz factor ''\u03b3''&nbsp;= d''t''/d''\u03c4'', the spacelike components express the rate of momentum change for that object from the perspective of the coordinates used to describe the metric.\n\nThis in turn can be broken down into parts due to proper and geometric components of acceleration and force.  If we further multiply the time-like component by lightspeed ''c'', and define coordinate velocity as '''v'''&nbsp;= d'''x'''/d''t'', we get an expression for rate of energy change as well:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dE}{dt}=\\vec{v}\\cdot\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}</math> (timelike) and <math>\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}=\\Sigma\\vec{f_o}+\\Sigma\\vec{f_g}=m(\\vec{a_o}+\\vec{a_g}) </math> (spacelike).\n\nHere ''a''<sub>''o''</sub> is an acceleration due to proper forces and ''a''<sub>''g''</sub> is, by default, a geometric acceleration that we see applied to the object because of our coordinate system choice.   At low speeds these accelerations combine to generate a coordinate acceleration like '''a'''=d<sup>2</sup>'''x'''/d''t''<sup>2</sup>, while for unidirectional motion ''at any speed'' ''a''<sub>''o''</sub>'s magnitude is that of proper acceleration ''\u03b1'' as in the section above where ''\u03b1''&nbsp;= ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>''a'' when ''a''<sub>''g''</sub> is zero.  In general expressing these accelerations and forces can be complicated.\n\nNonetheless if we use this breakdown to describe the connection coefficient (\u0393) term above in terms of geometric forces, then the motion of objects from the point of view of ''any coordinate system'' (at least at low speeds) can be seen as locally Newtonian.  This is already common practice e.g. with centrifugal force and gravity.  Thus the equivalence principle extends the local usefulness of Newton's laws to accelerated coordinate systems and beyond.\n\n===Surface dwellers on a planet===\n\nFor low speed observers being held at fixed radius from the center of a spherical planet or star, coordinate acceleration '''a'''<sub>shell</sub> is approximately related to proper acceleration '''a'''<sub>o</sub> by:\n\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{shell} = \\vec{a}_o - \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{r-r_s}} \\frac{G M}{r^2} \\hat{r} </math>\n\nwhere the planet or star's [[Schwarzschild radius]] r<sub>s</sub>=2GM/c<sup>2</sup>.  As our shell observer's radius approaches the Schwarzschild radius, the proper acceleration a<sub>o</sub> needed to keep it from falling in becomes intolerable.\n\nOn the other hand, for r>>r<sub>s</sub>, an upward proper force of only GMm/r<sup>2</sup> is needed to prevent one from accelerating downward.  At the Earth's surface this becomes:\n\n:<math>\\vec{a}_{shell} = \\vec{a}_o - g \\hat{r}</math>\n\nwhere g is the downward 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration due to gravity, and <math>\\hat{r}</math> is a unit vector in the radially outward direction from the center of the gravitating body.  Thus here an outward proper force of mg is needed to keep one from accelerating downward.\n\n===Four-vector derivations===\n\nThe spacetime equations of this section allow one to address ''all deviations'' between proper and coordinate acceleration in a single calculation.

It was turned into a musical by Wood, opening in 2005.\n\n==Television version==\nWood originally wrote ''Acorn Antiques'' as a weekly slot in her sketch shows ''[[Victoria Wood as Seen on TV]]''. She based it on the long-running [[Associated Television|ATV]]/Central serial ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' (1964-1988), and radio soap ''[[Waggoners' Walk]]'' (1969-1980).<ref>{{cite web|title=Waggoners Walk <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --> |url=http://www.geocities.com/uk_soaps/Waggoners_Walk/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5km8YWCxo?url=http://www.geocities.com/uk_soaps/Waggoners_Walk/ |archivedate=2009-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Suffolk\">\n{{cite web |date=2007-03-11 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2007/01/25/victoria_wood_acorn_antiques_interview_feature.shtml |title=BBC Suffolk interview with Victoria Wood |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-09-13 }}</ref> Swipes were also taken at current soaps such as ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Coronation Street]]'' with their apparent low production values, wobbly sets, [[overacting]], appalling dialogue and wildly improbable plots.\n\nIts premise\u2014the lives and loves of the staff of an antiques shop in a fictional English town called Manchesterford\u2014hardly reflects the ambitious and implausible storylines, which lampooned the staples of soap operas: love triangles, amnesiacs, sudden deaths and siblings reunited.\n\nIt also satirised the shortcomings of long-running dramas produced on small budgets with its little artificial-looking set, missed cues, crude camera work and hasty scripts. A lack of continuity is seen in distinct lapses where storylines are introduced and dropped between episodes and character development is forgotten. One episode, for example, is introduced as reflecting the current interest in health fads with a plot where the antiques shop is merged into a \"Leisure centre and sunbed centre\", never to be mentioned again. This story-line also reflected changes in the ''Crossroads'' storyline in the mid-1980s as a leisure centre opened at the motel where the serial was set. \n\nThe deliberately haphazard opening and end credits, together with its tinny title music, also lampooned ''Crossroads''. The opening sequence was updated for the second series, with a reworking of the theme tune and shots of Miss Babs, one of the leading characters, driving to ''Acorn Antiques'' in the firm's van. This too was reflective of changes in the ''Crossroads'' series at the time, as the show gained its first opening title sequence. Another nod to changes in the mid-1980s ''Crossroads'' opening sequence was the inclusion in one episode of ''Acorn Antiques'' of vertical window blinds, with the show's title written on them. Predictably, the ''Acorn Antiques'' version did not work and had to be pushed aside by hand. \n\nPerhaps the most comical element of ''Acorn Antiques'' were the missed cues, harking back to the days when ''Crossroads'' was recorded live. Fictional floor managers and directors can be heard prompting the dreadful actors to say their lines, whilst the end of several scenes show the actors not quite knowing what to do with themselves with the camera still rolling.\n\nReferences to other daytime television devices featured; after one episode a continuity announcer mentions an exhibition of costumes from the show touring several British towns, and after another episode a range of novelisations is mentioned (bearing such archetypical [[purple prose|purple]] titles as ''A Waning Moon'', and little resemblance to screened storylines). The announcement that the show's theme tune was available to buy as ''Anyone Can Break A Vase'' sung by Miss Babs, was a reference to the release of ''Anyone Can Fall In Love'', based on the ''EastEnders'' theme and sung by one of its cast members, [[Anita Dobson]].\n\nWood also created a spoof arts documentary about the show for her ''As Seen on TV'' special, in keeping with similar straight-faced \"behind-the-scenes\" shows produced about soap operas, which reveals the shambolic ''Acorn Antiques'' production, and interviews the self-obsessed fictional actors behind the fictional characters. At one point, when an obvious continuity error is pointed out, the hard-nosed producer \"Marion Clune\" (played by [[Maggie Steed]]) sums up the directorial attitude: \"We professionals notice - Joe Public never clocks a darn thing.\" The documentary also depicts the actress portraying the drudge Mrs. Overall as being an archetypal soap [[diva]] called Bo Beaumont (although in the series the fictional end titles credit [[Julie Walters]] as Mrs Overall).\n\nIn the final show of ''Victoria Wood As Seen on TV'' a sketch was shown where the actors playing Mrs Overall and Mr Clifford are supposedly axed from the soap and Bo Beaumont (Walters) breezes out of the studio, complaining to the TV news crew outside \"Does a faithful dog expect to be kicked?

The original run was directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] and had a sellout season in the West End.

It was revived on tour in 2007, directed this time by Victoria Wood herself.\n\nThe [[Crescent Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]] presented the premiere of the first amateur production of the show in May 2010.

Opens each episode on the phone introducing a never again mentioned plot line. Wife of Mr Kenneth, who was himself never seen on screen, mother of unnamed triplets afflicted with \"dangerously straight hair\" (and, we discover in one episode, Trixie Trouble), the triplets are kept amused by trips in the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]], ''[[Get Carter]]'' at the cinema and bedtime stories by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Miss Babs' torrid romances are hinted at but never seen: Mr Clifford once abandoned her by the handbags in a well-known store. Distinguishing features include a birthmark shaped like a moped. Her humanitarian credentials are revealed when she allows Mrs Overall a couple of hours off to attend her husband's funeral, provided she pops back at five for the hoovering.\n* '''Miss Berta''' ([[Victoria Wood]]): a partner in the business who begins the series emerging from intensive care to discover that her deceased father (believed murdered in [[Dakar]]) has been seen buying a padded envelope in the post office. She later develops [[amnesia]] and gets married to Clifford (the Bishop of Manchesterford officiating) before discovering that she is not only the twin sister of Derek, but also the daughter of Mrs Overall, and the mother of an unnamed baby. In the musical version, Berta is revealed to be Babs's sister: both siblings are the daughters of Mrs Overall.\n*'''Clifford''' ([[Duncan Preston]]): the stolid, reliable leading man whose advances are rejected by Babs. Shortly afterward he reveals he has married Miss Berta who is suffering from amnesia. Mr Clifford's voice mirrors that of David Hunter, sometime shareholder of the ''Crossroads'' Motel. He has a [[jet-set]]ting lifestyle: \"Bored with [[Zurich]] or did Zurich get bored with you?\" asks Miss Babs. In the series he is [[electric shock|electrocuted]] whilst unplugging an iron. In the musical, it is revealed that Mr Clifford's father knew of the paternity of the triplets, since he had sheltered the pregnant Mrs Overall, one rainy night.\n*'''Mrs Overall''' ([[Julie Walters]]): the elderly tea lady, who believes all problems could be solved with a nice cup of tea, a [[macaroon]] and an anecdote. One of her many specialities is home-made [[sherry]] served in a mug. Her late husband referred to her as Boadicea. Asked why, she confesses, \"He was barmy, Miss Babs\". She is revealed to be the sole beneficiary of Berta's father's will, and mother of Miss Berta and Derek. The rather grand actress who \"plays\" Mrs Overall (Bo Beaumont) was a former lover of [[Lord Delfont]].{{what|date=May 2018}} In the series she dies after choking on her own macaroon. According to Wood, the character of Mrs Overall was inspired by Mrs Mack in ''[[Take the High Road]]'' (''overall'' being a deliberate pun on ''mac'') and [[Amy Turtle]] in ''Crossroads'' (originally played by [[Ann George]] who was born in the same town that Walters spent her early years, [[Smethwick]]).<ref name=\"Suffolk\" />\n*'''Trixie''' ([[Rosie Collins]]): also known as Trixie Trouble, a feisty, [[Promiscuous|tarty]] ''[[femme fatale]]'' who works in the antiques packing department until she discovers she is Miss Babs' daughter. After her off-screen marriage to Bobby she mentions having had [[jaundice]], 'lots of' extramarital relationships (which may have included Derek, with whom she was in a car crash), and is seduced by her mother's cousin Jerez, shortly before she briefly runs away to [[Morocco]] with Derek. She also had a romantic interlude at the Formica Motel with Mr Kenneth, who gave her a leotard and a wet-look bra. She returns to become a nun, and later a [[:wikt:mother superior|mother superior]].\n*'''Derek''' ([[Kenny Ireland]]): the handyman, and revealed latterly Miss Berta's twin brother and Mrs Overall's other child. A long running affair with Miss Babs is hinted at and is briefly rekindled when his unseen girlfriend Marie-Therese Francine Dubois runs off, but this is interrupted by Trixie, with whom he also seems to have a relationship. He and Trixie later announce that they are 'travelling overland to Morocco' to find Trixie some nice [[jumpsuit]]s. It is also mentioned that he and Clifford are secretly playing the [[accordion]] and the [[ukulele]] together. Derek is based on the character Benny from ''Crossroads''. Kenny Ireland says he is still remembered best for his regular part in As Seen On TV. \"Twenty-odd years ago I played Derek the handyman in Acorn Antiques. To this day, nice camp waiters quote my dialogue at me, and are slightly disappointed that I don't remember any of the lines.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/review.cfm?id=144252007|title=Swingers and Roundabouts - Interview with Kenny Ireland|publisher=Scotland On Sunday|date=2007-03-15|access-date=2007-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225011610/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/review.cfm?id=144252007|archive-date=2007-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*'''Cousin Jerez''' ([[Peter Ellis (actor)|Peter Ellis]]): the foreign villain of the series, and previously unmentioned Spanish cousin of Miss Babs, who makes a rejected offer to buy the shop. Undaunted he disguises himself as a postman (whose signature whistle is the theme to ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'') to misdirect mail which would have warned Babs of a new motorway to be built nearby. His plans are thwarted by Clifford but not before he has attempted to seduce Trixie.

It was turned into a musical by Wood, opening in 2005.\n\n==Television version==\nWood originally wrote ''Acorn Antiques'' as a weekly slot in her sketch shows ''[[Victoria Wood as Seen on TV]]''. She based it on the long-running [[Associated Television|ATV]]/Central serial ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' (1964-1988), and radio soap ''[[Waggoners' Walk]]'' (1969-1980).<ref>{{cite web|title=Waggoners Walk <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --> |url=http://www.geocities.com/uk_soaps/Waggoners_Walk/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5km8YWCxo?url=http://www.geocities.com/uk_soaps/Waggoners_Walk/ |archivedate=2009-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Suffolk\">\n{{cite web |date=2007-03-11 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2007/01/25/victoria_wood_acorn_antiques_interview_feature.shtml |title=BBC Suffolk interview with Victoria Wood |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-09-13 }}</ref> Swipes were also taken at current soaps such as ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Coronation Street]]'' with their apparent low production values, wobbly sets, [[overacting]], appalling dialogue and wildly improbable plots.\n\nIts premise\u2014the lives and loves of the staff of an antiques shop in a fictional English town called Manchesterford\u2014hardly reflects the ambitious and implausible storylines, which lampooned the staples of soap operas: love triangles, amnesiacs, sudden deaths and siblings reunited.\n\nIt also satirised the shortcomings of long-running dramas produced on small budgets with its little artificial-looking set, missed cues, crude camera work and hasty scripts. A lack of continuity is seen in distinct lapses where storylines are introduced and dropped between episodes and character development is forgotten. One episode, for example, is introduced as reflecting the current interest in health fads with a plot where the antiques shop is merged into a \"Leisure centre and sunbed centre\", never to be mentioned again. This story-line also reflected changes in the ''Crossroads'' storyline in the mid-1980s as a leisure centre opened at the motel where the serial was set. \n\nThe deliberately haphazard opening and end credits, together with its tinny title music, also lampooned ''Crossroads''. The opening sequence was updated for the second series, with a reworking of the theme tune and shots of Miss Babs, one of the leading characters, driving to ''Acorn Antiques'' in the firm's van. This too was reflective of changes in the ''Crossroads'' series at the time, as the show gained its first opening title sequence. Another nod to changes in the mid-1980s ''Crossroads'' opening sequence was the inclusion in one episode of ''Acorn Antiques'' of vertical window blinds, with the show's title written on them. Predictably, the ''Acorn Antiques'' version did not work and had to be pushed aside by hand. \n\nPerhaps the most comical element of ''Acorn Antiques'' were the missed cues, harking back to the days when ''Crossroads'' was recorded live. Fictional floor managers and directors can be heard prompting the dreadful actors to say their lines, whilst the end of several scenes show the actors not quite knowing what to do with themselves with the camera still rolling.\n\nReferences to other daytime television devices featured; after one episode a continuity announcer mentions an exhibition of costumes from the show touring several British towns, and after another episode a range of novelisations is mentioned (bearing such archetypical [[purple prose|purple]] titles as ''A Waning Moon'', and little resemblance to screened storylines). The announcement that the show's theme tune was available to buy as ''Anyone Can Break A Vase'' sung by Miss Babs, was a reference to the release of ''Anyone Can Fall In Love'', based on the ''EastEnders'' theme and sung by one of its cast members, [[Anita Dobson]].\n\nWood also created a spoof arts documentary about the show for her ''As Seen on TV'' special, in keeping with similar straight-faced \"behind-the-scenes\" shows produced about soap operas, which reveals the shambolic ''Acorn Antiques'' production, and interviews the self-obsessed fictional actors behind the fictional characters. At one point, when an obvious continuity error is pointed out, the hard-nosed producer \"Marion Clune\" (played by [[Maggie Steed]]) sums up the directorial attitude: \"We professionals notice - Joe Public never clocks a darn thing.\" The documentary also depicts the actress portraying the drudge Mrs. Overall as being an archetypal soap [[diva]] called Bo Beaumont (although in the series the fictional end titles credit [[Julie Walters]] as Mrs Overall).\n\nIn the final show of ''Victoria Wood As Seen on TV'' a sketch was shown where the actors playing Mrs Overall and Mr Clifford are supposedly axed from the soap and Bo Beaumont  Walters) breezes out of the studio, complaining to the TV news crew outside \"Does a faithful dog expect to be kicked? That show was my life.\"\n\nThe sketches even led to a fanzine and appreciation gatherings where fans would dress up as the characters.<ref name=\"Brandwood\">{{cite book |last=Brandwood |first=Neil |title=Victoria Wood: The Biography |year=2002 |publisher=Boxtree |location=London |isbn=1-85227-982-6 |pages=  }}</ref> In 2004, in a poll on its website, [[Channel 4]] voted ''Acorn Antiques'' the 7th best comedy sketch of all time.<ref name=\"Channel4\">{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html |title=50 Greatest Comedy Sketches |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=2007-09-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184307/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html| archivedate= 12 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe show made a brief return to television in 1992 in ''Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast'', her satire on daytime television.<ref>{{cite web|url=\nhttp://www.search.com/reference/Acorn_Antiques|title=search.com - Acorn Antiques|publisher=search.com|date=2007-08-28}}</ref> A sketch of its soap, ''The Mall'', ends with Mrs Overall returning to reopen Acorn Antiques, mentioning that the other principal characters had been killed in a bus crash (even though she herself had been killed off in the final episode of the original series).
