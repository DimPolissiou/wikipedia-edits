The club's home ground is the [[Adush Mu\u00e7a Stadium]] and they currently compete in the [[Albanian Superliga]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe club was formed in September 1972 as Ballshi i Ri, and they played in the [[Albanian Second Division|Albanian Third Division]] between 1973 and 1976. But between 1976 and 1981, they were not allowed to participate in Albanian football due to laws restricting a single team from each district. They began playing once again in the Third Division in 1981, which they eventually won in 1986 and were promoted to the [[Albanian First Division|Albanian Second Division]]. The club played in the Second Division for 10 years between 1986 and 1996, where they were promoted following a successful 1995\u201396 season which saw the club score 124 goals and concede just 21, making it a national record which was even noted by prestigious French magazine [[France Football]]. However, despite their record breaking season they finished as runners-up in the league but still achieved promotion to the [[Albanian Superliga]].<ref>[http://sportekspres.com/?p=46653 Para viteve \u201890, asnj\u00ebher\u00eb mes m\u00eb t\u00eb mir\u00ebve] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140321105017/http://sportekspres.com/?p=46653 |date=2014-03-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Golden days===\nIn their debut season in the top flight of Albanian football the club finished in 14th place out of 18 teams.<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba97.html Albanian football season 1996\u201397]</ref> During the 1998\u201399 season, the club finished in third place, just 2 points behind the eventual champions [[KF Tirana]]<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba99.html Albanian football season 1998\u201399]</ref> this earned the club a place in the [[UEFA Cup]] for the first time.

Kapllanaj hit the FSHF delegate \u00c7ela in the head with a baton which required him to be rushed to hospital due to the injury. Cela refused to start the game due to overcrowding inside the [[Adush Mu\u00e7a Stadium]]. Once some of the fans had left they began to throw rock into the stadium in disapproval of the FSHF's decision to not let them watch the match, which kicked off 20 minutes later than scheduled. Kapllanaj then allegedly caused a power cut so that [[SuperSport Albania]] cameras could not transmit the game live as was planned. In the closing stages of the game [[KF La\u00e7i]] were awarded a penalty which caused crowd trouble, as they began to throw rocks onto the pitch. KF La\u00e7i's president Pashk Laska instructed captain and penalty taker [[Erjon Vu\u00e7aj]] to miss the penalty intentionally to avoid further trouble and danger for his teammates. Following the final whistle, Kapllanaj physically abused KF La\u00e7i's players by hitting them with a baton, as well as Besnik \u00c7ela, who later filed a police report against Kapllanaj once he left the hospital.<ref>[http://gazetadita.al/banditizem-ne-ballsh-kapllanaj-i-godet-te-gjithe-me-shkop-gome/ Banditiz\u00ebm n\u00eb Ballsh, Kapllanaj i godet t\u00eb gjith\u00eb me shkop gome]</ref> On 19 March, the club's president Besnik Kapllanaj resigned from his post hours before the verdict from the [[FSHF]] disciplinary commission, who punished him with a lifetime ban from sporting activities in Albania.

Bylis''' is an [[Albania]]n [[association football|football]] club based in [[Ballsh]], [[Mallakast\u00ebr District]]. The club's home ground is the [[Adush Mu\u00e7a Stadium]] and they currently compete in the [[Albanian Superliga]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe club was formed in September 1972 as Ballshi i Ri, and they played in the [[Albanian Second Division|Albanian Third Division]] between 1973 and 1976. But between 1976 and 1981 they were not allowed to participate in Albanian football due to laws restricting a single team from each district. They began playing once again in the Third Division in 1981, which they eventually won in 1986 and were promoted to the [[Albanian First Division|Albanian Second Division]]. The club played in the Second Division for 10 years between 1986 and 1996, where they were promoted following a successful 1995\u201396 season which saw the club score 124 goals and concede just 21, making it a national record which was even noted by prestigious French magazine [[France Football]]. However, despite their record breaking season they finished as runners-up in the league but still achieved promotion to the [[Albanian Superliga]].<ref>[http://sportekspres.com/?p=46653 Para viteve \u201890, asnj\u00ebher\u00eb mes m\u00eb t\u00eb mir\u00ebve] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140321105017/http://sportekspres.com/?p=46653 |date=2014-03-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Golden days===\nIn their debut season in the top flight of Albanian football the club finished in 14th place out of 18 teams.<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba97.html Albanian football season 1996\u201397]</ref> During the 1998\u201399 season the club finished in third place, just 2 points behind the eventual champions [[KF Tirana]]<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba99.html Albanian football season 1998\u201399]</ref> this earned the club a place in the [[UEFA Cup]] for the first time. In their first European experience KF Bylis played [[Slovakia]]n side [[FK Inter Bratislava|Inter Bratislava]], whom they lost 5\u20131 to on aggregate. The following season they would again finish strongly, this time in 5th place, joint on points with 4th place side [[Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr]], who they lost 4\u20133 to in the play-off for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] place.<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba99-2000.html Albanian football season 1999-00]</ref> In the 2000\u201301 season they finished 5th once again<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/albaa01.html Albania football season 2000\u201301]</ref> and earned a place in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, where they met Romanian side [[FC Universitatea Craiova]] the following season.

Between 2007 and 2009 the club achieved back-to-back promotions back to the [[Albanian Superliga]] for the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nBesnik Kapllanaj was the club's president between 2006 and 2014 and owned a  75% share in the club, with the remaining 25% owned by the [[Ballsh|Ballsh Municipality]].<ref>[http://sportekspres.com/?p=46552 Kapllanaj \u201cFutbollit i k\u00ebrkoj ndjes\u00eb, p\u00ebr 8 vite dhash\u00eb edhe shpirtin!\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320190445/http://sportekspres.com/?p=46552 |date=2014-03-20 }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 March 2014 in a home tie against [[KF La\u00e7i]]<ref>[https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/03/15/albania/super-league/ks-bylis-ballsh/kf-laci/1658872/ Bylish 0\u20130 La\u00e7i]</ref> the club's president was involved in an altercation with the FSHS head of competitions, Besnik \u00c7ela. Kapllanaj hit the FSHF delegate \u00c7ela in the head with a baton which required him to be rushed to hospital due to the injury. Cela refused to start the game due to overcrowding inside the [[Adush Mu\u00e7a Stadium]]. Once some of the fans had left they began to throw rock into the stadium in disapproval of the FSHF's decision to not let them watch the match, which kicked off 20 minutes later than scheduled. Kapllanaj then allegedly caused a power cut so that [[SuperSport Albania]] cameras could not transmit the game live as was planned. In the closing stages of the game [[KF La\u00e7i]] were awarded a penalty which caused crowd trouble, as they began to throw rocks onto the pitch. KF La\u00e7i's president Pashk Laska instructed captain and penalty taker [[Erjon Vu\u00e7aj]] to miss the penalty intentionally to avoid further trouble and danger for his teammates. Following the final whistle Kapllanaj physically abuses KF La\u00e7i's players by hitting them with a baton, as well as Besnik \u00c7ela, who later filed a police report against Kapllanaj once he left the hospital.<ref>[http://gazetadita.al/banditizem-ne-ballsh-kapllanaj-i-godet-te-gjithe-me-shkop-gome/ Banditiz\u00ebm n\u00eb Ballsh, Kapllanaj i godet t\u00eb gjith\u00eb me shkop gome]</ref> On 19 March the club's president Besnik Kapllanaj resigned from his post hours before the verdict from the [[FSHF]] disciplinary commission, who punished him with a lifetime ban from sporting activities in Albania. The commission also expelled the club from the [[Albanian Superliga]] with 9 remaining games of the 2013\u201314 season, relegating the club to the [[Albanian First Division]] for the 2014\u201315 season as well as handing KF La\u00e7i a 3\u20130 victory in the game which originally ended 0\u20130.<ref>[http://www.fshf.org/index.php/sq/lajme/1165-disiplina-denon-aktet-dhunes-ne-futboll Disiplina d\u00ebnon aktet dhun\u00ebs n\u00eb futboll]</ref> The following day Kapllanaj turned himself in to the [[Fier]] police authorities after being charged for assault.<ref>[http://www.panorama-sport.com/bylis/kapllanaj-dorehiqem-nga-bylisi-vetedorezohem-ne-polici/ Disiplina p\u00ebrjashton Bylisin, ja se si ndryshon Superiorja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320190818/http://www.panorama-sport.com/bylis/kapllanaj-dorehiqem-nga-bylisi-vetedorezohem-ne-polici/ |date=2014-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Recent seasons==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=60px|Season\n!width=60px|League\n!width=30px|Pos\n!width=30px|Pld\n!width=30px|W\n!width=30px|D\n!width=30px|L\n!width=30px|GF\n!width=30px|GA\n!width=30px|Pts\n|-align=center\n|[[2007-08 Albanian First Division|2007\u201308]]\n|2\n|1\n|34\n|23\n|5\n|6\n|70\n|20\n|74\n|-align=center\n|[[2008-09 Albanian Superliga|2008\u201309]]\n|1\n|9\n|33\n|9\n|10\n|14\n|28\n|38\n|37\n|-align=center\n|[[2009-10 Albanian First Division|2009\u201310]]\n|2\n|1\n|30\n|22\n|3\n|5\n|57\n|26\n|69\n|-align=center\n|[[2010\u201311 Albanian Superliga|2010\u201311]]\n|1\n|6\n|33\n|13\n|4\n|16\n|44\n|48\n|43\n|-align=center\n|[[2011\u201312 Albanian Superliga|2011\u201312]]\n|1\n|7\n|26\n|9\n|8\n|9\n|40\n|37\n|35\n|-align=center\n|[[2012\u201313 Albanian Superliga|2012\u201313]]\n|1\n|10\n|26\n|9\n|6\n|11\n|32\n|29\n|30\n|-align=center\n|[[2013\u201314 Albanian Superliga|2013\u201314]]\n|1\n|12\n|33\n|5\n|9\n|19\n|20\n|54\n|24\n|-align=center\n|[[2014\u201315 Albanian First Division|2014\u201315]]\n|2 B\n|1\n|27\n|17\n|2\n|8\n|46\n|26\n|53\n|-align=center\n|[[2015\u201316 Albanian Superliga|2015\u201316]]\n|1\n|9\n|36\n|8\n|8\n|20\n|27\n|53\n|32\n|-align=center\n|[[2016\u201317 Albanian First Division|2016\u201317]]\n|2 B\n|2\n|26\n|17\n|6\n|3\n|40\n|15\n|38\n|-align=center\n|[[2017\u201318 Albanian First Division|2017\u201318]]\n|2 B\n|2\n|26\n|14\n|7\n|5\n|43\n|24\n|29\n|-align=center\n|[[2018\u201319 Albanian First Division|2018\u201319]]\n|2 B\n|1\n|26\n|21\n|3\n|2\n|52\n|10\n|45\n|}\n\n==KF Bylis in Europe==\n''As of December, 2008.''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The game is named for its setting, Castle Shadowgate, residence of the evil [[Warlock]] Lord. The [[player character|player]], as the \"last of a great line of hero-kings\" is charged with the task of saving the world by defeating the Warlock Lord, who is attempting to summon up the demon [[Behemoth]] out of Hell. Later that year, a color version of the game was released for the [[Atari ST]], and in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Shadowgate screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The beginning of the game in the Macintosh version]]\nThe [[player character|player]] must solve a series of [[logic puzzle|puzzles]] throughout the castle to proceed to the Warlock Lord's chamber. Due to the castle's perilous nature, at least one lit torch must be in the player's possession at all times. If the torch is extinguished, the player soon stumbles, breaking his neck, and must then continue from a [[saved game]] (or the area in which they died, in game console versions). Only a finite number of torches are to be found throughout the game, which effectively acts as a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] to proceedings. Various items that can be acquired include a sword, a sling and other ancient weapons; though these weapons can not actually be used as striking weapons, they can be clicked on at the appropriate time to deliver a fatal blow to specific enemies.\n\nThe game is notorious for its many opportunities for death, including being burned by a dragon's breath, attacked by a cyclops, sucked into outer space through a broken mirror, dissolved by acidic slime, mauled by a wolf-woman, eaten by sharks, and suicide. Virtually any action taken by the player which is not the correct solution to a puzzle will result in a fatality. These deaths were often graphically described in the game's text (along with often sardonic and humorous comments), even in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version (in spite of [[Nintendo]]'s policy of [[censorship]] at the time). Many of the game's puzzles rely on a system of [[trial and error]], the problem of which is overcome by the ability to save the game state (as in most [[adventure game]]s). Subtle hints can be found in books and the descriptive [[Macventure#Features|game texts]]. In the NES version, these are replaced by an outright hint feature which gives vague clues about what is noteworthy in any given room in the castle. The further the player progresses, however, the more useless this feature becomes, deteriorating into nothing but encouraging messages by the game's end. The NES version of Shadowgate also carries the distinction of being one of the few NES games to be available in a [[Swedish language]] version.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n\nAt the very beginning of ''Shadowgate'', the only information the game provides the player is that,\n\n<blockquote>\"The last thing that you remember is standing before the wizard Lakmir as he gestured wildly and chanted in an archaic tongue.

While reading some of the in-game books and scrolls are necessary to finish the game, others only provide exposition about the world ''Shadowgate'' takes place in.  Reading the book ''Before Shadowgate'', the comic book ''Shadowgate Saga: Raven'', and playing the sequels ''[[Beyond Shadowgate]]'' and ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers]]'' reveals more details.\n\n===The world of ''Shadowgate''===\n''Shadowgate'' takes place in the fictional world of \"Tyragon\" where creatures from fantasy and myth live.  In the land of \"Kal Zathynn\", on top of \"Gatekeeper Mountain\", is the living castle of \"Shadowgate\" where a group of powerful wizards known as the \"Circle of Twelve\" once met.  One of the Circle of Twelve, \"Talimar\", became corrupt and was removed from the Circle.  After that, he began to call himself \"The Warlock Lord\" and caused chaos across the lands by inciting conflict between humans, elves, dwarves, and the races on Tyragon.  After those wars ended and the land began to rebuild, the Warlock Lord amassed an army of followers, including trolls, orcs, goblins, and other creatures.  He waged war against the Kings of the Lands, and was defeated when the rest of the Circle of Twelve intervened.  They sealed the Warlock Lord inside the caverns underneath Shadowgate, and then disbanded.  The only wizard who remained was \"Lakmir\", who took on the role of Tyragon's guardian to ensure that the Warlock Lord's evil would not threaten the Lands again.\n\nYears later, the Warlock Lord escaped from his confinement, and planned to raise the mightiest of titans, the Behemoth, from the depths of darkness to serve him.  With the Behemoth, the Warlock Lord would escape Castle Shadowgate, and terrorize the planet once more.  To keep this from happening, Lakmir sought out the last of the \"Line of Kings\", also known as \"The Seed of Prophecy\", who was foretold to stop the Warlock Lord and the Behemoth.  Doing so would require the \"Staff of Ages\", a powerful artifact with enough power to slay the Behemoth that was hidden within Shadowgate.  After finding this hero, Lakmir sends him to the entrance of Shadowgate to begin his quest.\n\nIt is up to the player to take on the role of \"The Seed of Prophecy\", enter Castle Shadowgate, solve its puzzles, survive its many traps, and stop the Warlock Lord once and for all.  If they survive to the end, they will come across the Warlock Lord immediately after he succeeds in opening the gates of Hell and summoning the Behemoth.  If the player was successful in finding the holy [[artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] called the Staff of Ages by this point, then they would be able to mortally wound the demon with it.   As it dies, the Behemoth then drags the Warlock Lord with him into Hell.  The player returns victorious, where he is [[betrothed]] to the [[monarch|King]]'s daughter and entitled High Lord of the Westland.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n|GR = 67.14% (GBC)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/198609-shadowgate-classic/index.html | title = Shadowgate Classic for Game Boy Color | publisher = [[GameRankings]] | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}</ref>\n|Allgame = {{Rating|4|5}} (PC)<ref>{{cite web |archivedate=2014-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114164519/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=41584| url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=41584 | title = Shadowgate (PC) - Overview | publisher = [[Allgame]] | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}</ref><br/>{{Rating|3|5}} (MAC)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14347&tab=review|archivedate=2014-11-15|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141115123828/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14347&tab=review | title = Shadowgate | publisher = Allgame | accessdate = 2015-05-05|last=Baker|first=Christopher Michael}}</ref><br/>{{Rating|4.5|5}} (NES)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14347&tab=review | title = Shadowgate (NES) - Review | last = Baker | first = Christopher Michael | publisher = Allgame | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}</ref><br/>{{Rating|2.5|5}} (GBC, Pocket PC)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=18434&tab=review | title = Shadowgate Classic (GBC) - Review | last = White | first = Jason | publisher = Allgame | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}</ref>\n|GSpot = 5.8 out of 10 (GBC)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/shadowgate-classic/reviews/shadowgate-classic-review-2537194/ | title = Shadowgate Classic Review | last = Davis | first = Cameron | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | date = 2000-01-28 | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}</ref>\n|IGN = 6 out of 10 (GBC)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/02/shadowgate-classic | title = Shadowgate Classic | last = Cleveland | first = Adam | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2000-02-01 | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}</ref>\n|NP = 7.3 out of 10 (GBC)<ref>{{cite journal | title = Shadowgate Classic | journal = [[Nintendo Power]] | date = February 1999}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave the game a very positive review, noting the game uses the same superior interface as prior MacVenture games. The difficulty was noted as a step up from ''[[Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True|Deja Vu]]'' and ''[[Uninvited (game)|Uninvited]]'', but ''Shadowgate'' was also said to be more flexible, allowing more than one solution to some puzzles.<ref name = \"CGW\">{{Cite news | date = November 1987 | last = Hines | first = Tracie Forman | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Shadowgate: Inside the Castle Shadowgate  | pages = 41, 57 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1987 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers stated that \"''Shadowgate'' is a great adventure game in that you must continually be aware of what\u2019s already been accomplished to complete subsequent puzzles.\" The reviewers gave the game 5/5 stars.<ref name=\"Dragon128\">{{cite journal\n|title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=128 |date=December 1987|pages=92\u201396}}</ref>\n\n''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Shadowgate'', praising its extensive gameplay, stating that \"So much is jammed into these two disks that nearly everyone should find this game appealing ... ShadowGate [''sic''] plays easily and instinctively.\" ''Macworld'' also praises ''Shadowgate's'' graphics and sound, calling the graphics \"expertly crafted\", but express that they \"[tend] to lack originality\", and call the sound effects \"far better than those of most adventure games.\" ''Macworld'' calls ''Shadowgate'' \"technically, visually, and aurally superior to most of its competition\" but criticizes the game's mood, stating that it doesn't \"take itself seriously enough to create a mood of mystery\", and also lacks the 'tongue-in-cheek' humor of other adventure games, creating a feeling of something \"lacking\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last = McCandless|first = Keith|title = More Castle Hassles: ShadowGate 1.0 Review|date = September 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8709_September_1987/page/n173 |magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 168}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swedish language]] version was noted because the \"Go\" and \"Hit\" abilities were mistranslated into \"G\u00e4\" and \"Sl\u00e4\", instead of \"G\u00e5\" and \"Sl\u00e5\" which is the correct translation. [[Bergsala]] included a letter with an apology.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nThe game proved popular enough to be ported to various other personal computers including a color version of the game for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga later in 1987. In 1988 it was released for the DOS operating system and finally in 1989 for the Apple IIGS. It made its first console appearance later that year on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].\n\nThe success of ''Shadowgate'' on the NES prompted [[ICOM Simulations]] to have [[Kemco]]/[[Seika]] port the other MacVenture titles to the console including [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (video game)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]] and [[Uninvited (video game)|Uninvited]].\n\nIn 1991, a novel published by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the pen name 'F.X. Nine' called ''Before Shadowgate'', was published by [[Scholastic Corporation]] as part of the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series of video game novelizations of third party [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games.  Contributing to the book were ''Shadowgate'' creators [[Dave Marsh (game developer)|Dave Marsh]] and [[Karl Roelofs]], who provided important details and information to the book's author.\n\nIn 1992, an enhanced version of the game was released for the IBM PC (Windows 3.1). Afterwards it was ported to other operating systems (Windows '95/'98/2000/Me) and portable systems (Windows CE P/PC and Pocket PC) in subsequent years by Infinite Ventures under the name of ''Shadowgate Classic''. The [[Pocket PC]] version featured new rooms and artwork.\n\nIn 1999, the NES version of ''Shadowgate'' was ported to the [[Game Boy Color]] with enhanced sprites and animations also under the name of ''Shadowgate Classic''.\n\nA mobile phone version of the game was released in 2005 by Vindigo Entertainment. Once again using the name of ''Shadowgate Classic'', this version featured brand new graphics, puzzles, challenges, and areas. This version was used as the foundation for the [[Zojoi|Zojoi, LLC]] remake in 2014.\n \nOn October 26, 2012, [[Zojoi|Zojoi, LLC]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to secure funding for a remake of ''Shadowgate''.  Original game creators [[Dave Marsh (game developer)|Dave Marsh]] and [[Karl Roelofs]] appeared in the pitch video and showed pre-production footage of the game in development. They set a [[crowd-funding]] goal of $120,000.<ref name=\"Shadowgate Kicktraq\">{{cite web\n | url          = http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/zojoi/shadowgate/ \n| title = Shadowgate\n | others        = Additional content provided by Zojoi\n | date         = 2012-11-28\n| publisher = Kicktraq\n | at           = \n | accessdate   = 2012-11-28\n}}</ref> In the 2nd update of the Kickstarter campaign, it was announced that the Black Axe, an item and quest that had been cut from the original game due to size constraints, will be reintroduced in the new version of ''Shadowgate''.<ref name=\"Shadowgate_Update_02\">{{cite web\n | url          = http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zojoi/shadowgate/posts/338043\n| title = Seek Ye the Black Axe!\n | author       = Zojoi, LLC\n | date         = 2012-10-29\n| publisher = [[Kickstarter]]\n | id           = 338043\n | accessdate   = 2012-11-05\n| author-link = Zojoi\n }}</ref> Those who pledged $2,500 or more received a replica Staff of Ages.

The first, ''[[Beyond Shadowgate]]'', was released for the [[TurboGrafx 16]] in 1993 and the second called ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers]]'' was released for the [[Nintendo 64]] in 1999.  Another N64 sequel, ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers#Sequel|Shadowgate Rising]]'', was planned and well into development, but the project was scrapped when Nintendo announced the creation of the game console which would go on to become the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], and it now only exists in the form of a handful of [[game development|development]] [[screenshot]]s and a [[comics|comic]] now hosted on [[Zojoi]]'s website entitled ''Shadowgate Saga: Raven''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zojoi.com/shadowgate/ Zojoi's ''Shadowgate'' site]\n*{{moby game|id=/shadowgate|name=''Shadowgate''}}\n*''[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ylu1ii2vwpwx5gcc Shadowgate] at [http://ifdb.tads.org Interactive Fiction Database]\n*{{Internet Archive game|msdos_Shadowgate_1987}}\n*{{isfdb title|2210421|Before Shadowgate}}\n\n{{MacVentures}}\n{{Shadowgate}}\n\n[[Category:1987 video games]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Apple IIGS games]]\n[[Category:Atari ST games]]\n[[Category:CD-i games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:First-person adventure games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Color games]]\n[[Category:ICOM Simulations games]]\n[[Category:Mac OS games]]\n[[Category:Mobile games]]\n[[Category:Shadowgate]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows Mobile Professional games]]\n[[Category:Dark fantasy video games]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in video games]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Palm OS games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo hard games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title = Shadowgate\n| image = Shadowgate Coverart.png\n| caption = Cover art used in the Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, DOS and Macintosh versions\n| developer = [[ICOM Simulations|ICOM Simulations, Inc.]]\n| publisher = {{Unbulleted list|[[Mindscape]]|[[Kemco|Kemco-Seika]] (NES)}}\n| engine = [[MacVenture]]\n| platforms = {{Collapsible list|title=Platforms|[[Apple IIGS]]|[[Atari ST]]|[[Commodore Amiga]]|[[DOS]]|[[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]|[[Windows]]|[[Game Boy Color]]|[[Mobile phone]]||[[Palm OS]]|[[Pocket PC]] (ARM, MIPS)| [[Virtual Console]]|[[PlayStation 4]]|[[Xbox One]]|[[Nintendo Switch]]}}\n| released = {{collapsible list|title=July 30, 1987\n|'''Macintosh'''{{video game release|NA|July 30, 1987<ref name=\"Shadowgate-US-Trademark\">{{Citation\n|date=9 February 1993\n| title = Trademark Principal Register Shadowgate\n| publisher = [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]\n| location = Alexandria, Virginia\n| at = First Use\n| id = {{US trademark|74317464}}; Registration No. 1,768,768\n| url = http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=74317464&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch\n| accessdate = 2012-10-09\n| mode=cs1\n| postscript =\n}}</ref>}}\n|'''Amiga'''{{video game release|NA|1987}}\n|'''DOS'''{{video game release|NA|1988}}\n|'''NES'''{{video game release|JP|March 31, 1989|NA|December, 1989|PAL|May 30, 1991}}{{vgrelease|JP|April 30, 2014 (Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console)}}\n|'''Windows'''{{video game release|NA|1993|EU|1993}}\n|'''GBC'''{{video game release|NA|January, 1999}}{{video game release|JP|August 13, 1999}}\n|'''Pocket PC'''{{video game release|NA|2002}}\n|'''PlayStation 4'''{{video game release|NA|October, 2017}}}}\n| genre = [[Adventure game|Adventure]]\n| modes = [[single-player video game|Single-player]]\n| director = {{Unbulleted list|[[Dave Marsh (game developer)|Dave Marsh]]|[[Karl Roelofs]]}}<ref name=\"Before_Shadowgate_Copyright_Registration\">{{Citation\n|date=May 1991\n| title = Before Shadowgate / book created by F.

The difficulty was noted as a step up from ''[[Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True|Deja Vu]]'' and ''[[Uninvited (game)|Uninvited]]'', but ''Shadowgate'' was also said to be more flexible, allowing more than one solution to some puzzles.<ref name = \"CGW\">{{Cite news | date = November 1987 | last = Hines | first = Tracie Forman | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Shadowgate: Inside the Castle Shadowgate  | pages = 41, 57 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1987 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers stated that \"''Shadowgate'' is a great adventure game in that you must continually be aware of what\u2019s already been accomplished to complete subsequent puzzles.\" The reviewers gave the game 5/5 stars.<ref name=\"Dragon128\">{{cite journal\n|title=The Role of Computers |last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk |journal=Dragon |issue=128 |date=December 1987|pages=92\u201396}}</ref>\n\n''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh version of ''Shadowgate'', praising its extensive gameplay, stating that \"So much is jammed into these two disks that nearly everyone should find this game appealing ... ShadowGate [''sic''] plays easily and instinctively.\" ''Macworld'' also praises ''Shadowgate's'' graphics and sound, calling the graphics \"expertly crafted\", but express that they \"[tend] to lack originality\", and call the sound effects \"far better than those of most adventure games.\" ''Macworld'' calls ''Shadowgate'' \"technically, visually, and aurally superior to most of its competition\" but criticizes the game's mood, stating that it doesn't \"take itself seriously enough to create a mood of mystery\", and also lacks the 'tongue-in-cheek' humor of other adventure games, creating a feeling of something \"lacking\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last = McCandless|first = Keith|title = More Castle Hassles: ShadowGate 1.0 Review|date = September 1987|url = https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_8709_September_1987/page/n173 |magazine = Macworld|publisher = Mac Publishing|page = 168}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swedish language]] version was noted because the \"Go\" and \"Hit\" abilities were mistranslated into \"G\u00e4\" and \"Sl\u00e4\", instead of \"G\u00e5\" and \"Sl\u00e5\" which is the correct translation. [[Bergsala]] included a letter with an apology.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nThe game proved popular enough to be ported to various other personal computers including a color version of the game for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga later in 1987. In 1988 it was released for the DOS operating system and finally in 1989 for the Apple IIGS. It made its first console appearance later that year on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. \n\nThe success of ''Shadowgate'' on the NES prompted [[ICOM Simulations]] to have [[Kemco]]/[[Seika]] port the other MacVenture titles to the console including [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (video game)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]] and [[Uninvited (video game)|Uninvited]].\n\nIn 1991, a novel published by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the pen name 'F.X. Nine' called ''Before Shadowgate'', was published by [[Scholastic Corporation]] as part of the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' series of video game novelizations of third party [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games.  Contributing to the book were ''Shadowgate'' creators [[Dave Marsh (game developer)|Dave Marsh]] and [[Karl Roelofs]], who provided important details and information to the book's author.\n\nIn 1992, an enhanced version of the game was released for the IBM PC (Windows 3.1). Afterwards it was ported to other operating systems (Windows '95/'98/2000/Me) and portable systems (Windows CE P/PC and Pocket PC) in subsequent years by Infinite Ventures under the name of ''Shadowgate Classic''. The [[Pocket PC]] version featured new rooms and artwork. \n\nIn 1999, the NES version of ''Shadowgate'' was ported to the [[Game Boy Color]] with enhanced sprites and animations also under the name of ''Shadowgate Classic''. \n\nA mobile phone version of the game was released in 2005 by Vindigo Entertainment. Once again using the name of ''Shadowgate Classic'', this version featured brand new graphics, puzzles, challenges, and areas. This version was used as the foundation for the [[Zojoi|Zojoi, LLC]] remake in 2014.\n \nOn October 26, 2012, [[Zojoi|Zojoi, LLC]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to secure funding for a remake of ''Shadowgate''.  Original game creators [[Dave Marsh (game developer)|Dave Marsh]] and [[Karl Roelofs]] appeared in the pitch video and showed pre-production footage of the game in development. They set a [[crowd-funding]] goal of $120,000.<ref name=\"Shadowgate Kicktraq\">{{cite web\n | url          = http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/zojoi/shadowgate/ \n| title = Shadowgate\n | others        = Additional content provided by Zojoi\n | date         = 2012-11-28\n| publisher = Kicktraq\n | at           = \n | accessdate   = 2012-11-28\n}}</ref> In the 2nd update of the Kickstarter campaign, it was announced that the Black Axe, an item and quest that had been cut from the original game due to size constraints, will be reintroduced in the new version of ''Shadowgate''.<ref name=\"Shadowgate_Update_02\">{{cite web\n | url          = http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zojoi/shadowgate/posts/338043\n| title = Seek Ye the Black Axe!\n | author       = Zojoi, LLC\n | date         = 2012-10-29\n| publisher = [[Kickstarter]]\n | id           = 338043\n | accessdate   = 2012-11-05\n| author-link = Zojoi\n }}</ref> Those who pledged $2,500 or more received a replica Staff of Ages.

The first, ''[[Beyond Shadowgate]]'', was released for the [[TurboGrafx 16]] in 1993 and the second called ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers]]'' was released for the [[Nintendo 64]] in 1999.  Another N64 sequel, ''[[Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers#Sequel|Shadowgate Rising]]'', was planned and well into development, but the project was scrapped when Nintendo announced the creation of the game console which would go on to become the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], and it now only exists in the form of a handful of [[game development|development]] [[screenshot]]s and a [[comics|comic]] now hosted on [[Zojoi]]'s website entitled ''Shadowgate Saga: Raven''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zojoi.com/shadowgate/ Zojoi's ''Shadowgate'' site]\n*{{moby game|id=/shadowgate|name=''Shadowgate''}}\n*''[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ylu1ii2vwpwx5gcc Shadowgate] at [http://ifdb.tads.org Interactive Fiction Database]\n*{{Internet Archive game|msdos_Shadowgate_1987}}\n*{{isfdb title|2210421|Before Shadowgate}}\n\n{{MacVentures}}\n{{Shadowgate}}\n[[Category:1987 video games]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Apple IIGS games]]\n[[Category:Atari ST games]]\n[[Category:CD-i games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:First-person adventure games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Color games]]\n[[Category:ICOM Simulations games]]\n[[Category:Mac OS games]]\n[[Category:Mobile games]]\n[[Category:Shadowgate]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows Mobile Professional games]]\n[[Category:Dark fantasy video games]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in video games]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Palm OS games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo hard games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n", "name_user": "Inwind", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowgate"}
