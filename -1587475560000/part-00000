Luckily, he survives and in a lounge, he meets a girl ([[Katrina Kaif]]). She tells him a story, about six friends and their boss who all work together at a Mumbai-based call centre. They are instructed never to reveal their location and speak with an American accent by a Boston-based company. There is Shyam (Sam) ([[Sharman Joshi]]), Priyanka ([[Gul Panag]]), Varun ([[Sohail Khan]]), Esha ([[Isha Koppikar]]), Radhika ([[Amrita Arora]]) and Military Uncle ([[Sharat Saxena]]). Their boss, Subhash Bakshi ([[Dalip Tahil]]), attempts to further his career by plagiarising software, agreeing to lay off 40% of the Indian workforce, and re-locate to Boston. Although these six friends work together, they still go through some struggles ;Shyam tries his best to reconcile with Priyanka after their breakup, Esha gets annoyed by Varun when she thinks he likes her, Radhika is heartbroken when her husband Anuj ([[Arbaaz Khan]]) cheats on her with his girlfriend, and Military Uncle wants a visa to see his son and grandson. Bakshi turns their names into American names such as turning Shyam into Agent Sam, Varun to Agent Victor, Esha to Elizabeth, Priyanka to Pearl, and Radhika to Rebecca.\n\nOne night, Shyam and his friends are forced to work in the nighttime shift until 4:00 in the morning. At work, Shyam realizes that Priyanka is going through a tough time with her arranged marriage with Ganesh, a wealthy Indian-American who stays in the United States, Shyam taps the phones phone line thanks to Varun helping him so that he can overhear their conversations. When Bakshi calls all of them to his office for a meeting, he talks with his American boss and the six friends overhear his plan about him going to Boston and steals Shyam and Varun\u2019s website manual along with him. Esha gets upset telling Shyam that Varun used her for nothing so Shyam tries talking to Varun until he loses his temper and starts breaking everything. At a party, they all get drunk and decide to head back home since it is late. The six are on their way home, until they approach an accident, and are stuck on top of a cliff in their car, and if anybody tries to move, the car may lose its balance and fall off the cliff. They all remain calm, and Shyam tries to call someone, he finds his phone battery has run out, therefore, in a rage he breaks his phone and throws it on the floor of the car. Later on, still trapped in the car, the broken phone receives a phone call; six surprised friends answer it, only to find the caller is God. God tells the six, they should keep calm, and just believe in themselves and all will be well. They do as they are told, and find that the [[fire brigade]] has arrived to save them. They all are saved. Bakshi is fired by his American boss and replaced by Shyam because he always had potential. Years later, Shyam and Varun open their own website academy, Shyam proposes to Priyanka and marries her, Military Uncle pays for a visa and goes to America, Radhika lives a carefree life after divorcing Anuj, Esha quits her fashion modeling career and works as an NGO Labourer, and Priyanka studies to becomes a school teacher. After the story, Khan asks the woman who she is, and she replies \"if you believe in yourself, you will know the answer\".

Not happy with the decision Gibbons told his men to remove three portions of the track near [[Parramatta]]. He was arrested and placed in the Parramatta Watch House before being released on bail. Two days later the first train ran into Black Town Road station.

Sudeten Germans were mostly [[Roman Catholics]], a legacy of centuries of [[Austrian Habsburg]] rule.\n\nNot all ethnic Germans lived in isolated and well-defined areas; for historical reasons, Czechs and Germans mixed in many places, and Czech-German bilingualism was quite common. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 19th century, Czechs and Germans began to create separate cultural, educational, political and economic institutions, which kept both groups semiisolated from each other. That form of separation continued until the end of the Second World War, when almost all Germans were expelled.\n\n[[File:Sudetendeutsche.png|thumb|200px|right|Czech districts by ethnic German population in 1930:<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistick\u00fd lexikon obc\u00ed v Republice \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 I.

Though they were living beyond the medieval [[Kingdom of Germany]], an independent German Bohemian awareness, however, was not widespread, and for a long time, it played no decisive role in everyday life. Individuals were usually seen as Bohemians, Moravians or Silesians. Defining events later in German Bohemian history were the [[Hussite Wars]], the occupation of Bohemia by the [[Czech Brethren]], the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]], when the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were severely affected, which caused the immigration of further German settlers.\n\nAfter the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] became King of Bohemia, which became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent [[college]]s, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university.

Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] came up with a plan, known as the [[United States of Greater Austria]], in 1909.

Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the [[Bohemian Crown]] according to the principle of ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''. The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly-industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of goverment, [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]], wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (''Verwaltungskreisen''), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, [[Max Hussarek von Heinlein]], offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the [[United States]] in the war as an associate power of the [[Triple Entente]]. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Province of German Bohemia===\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, to unite all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the [[Province of German Bohemia]] was formed with its capital in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia that stretched from the [[Egerland]] to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In South Bohemia the administrative unit of B\u00f6hmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of [[Upper Austria]]. German Bohemia in the [[Orlick\u00e9 hory|Eagle Mountains]] and in the area of [[Lan\u0161kroun|Landskron]] merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of [[Nov\u00e1 Byst\u0159ice|Neubistritz]] was incorporated into [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and [[Vienna]] was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of [[German Austria]]. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung''), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180004&seite=00000051&size=45 Act, StGBl.

The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]], then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.<ref>[http://www.cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/wp061.pdf Suppan, Arnold: ''Austrians, Czechs, and Sudeten Germans as a Community of Conflict in the Twentieth Century'', p. 9]</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. Instead, it would become part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an [[ethnic minority]]. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\n===Demography===\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6&nbsp;million Czechs, 3.2&nbsp;million Germans, two million [[Slovaks]], 0.7&nbsp;million [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], half a million [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyns), 300,000 [[Jew]]s, and 100,000 [[Poles]], as well as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Croats]] and other ethnic groups.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated5 /> German-speakers represented a third of the population of the [[Czech lands|Bohemian lands]] and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6&nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding [[Cheb|Eger]] was the most active area for pan-German nationalism.  \nThe [[Upper Palatinate Forest]], an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]].\n\n[[Moravia]] contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs.  Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern [[Silesia]], which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Gradual general acceptance of Czechoslovak citizenship==\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|250px|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfill what the Czechs had promised in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister ([[Robert Mayr-Harting]] and [[Franz Spina]]), and the first German political party became part of the government ([[German Christian Social People's Party]] and [[Farmers' League]]).<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/talking/hitlers-fifth-column \"Hitler's Fifth Column\"]. Radio Prague. December 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]], adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\n\n[[File:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|thumb|250px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]]]\nAt a party conference in [[Teplitz]] in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the ''[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei]]'' (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, [[Ludwig Czech]] became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by [[Wenzel Jaksch]].\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with [[Hans Sch\u00fctz]] of the [[German Christian Social People's Party]] (''Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei'') and [[Gustav Hacker]] of the Farmers' Association (''Bund der Landwirte'', formed the ''[[Jungaktivisten]]'' (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia. At simultaneous mass rallies in [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn|Tetschen-Bodenbach/D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]], [[\u017datec|Saaz/\u017datec]] and [[Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch|Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch/Gie\u00dfh\u00fcbl im Adlergebirge]] on April 26, 1936, they demanded equal opportunities in civil service for Germans, financial assistance for German businesses, official acceptance of the [[German language]] for public servants in the Sudetenland and measures to reduce unemployment in the Sudetenland. (At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the [[German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)|German National Socialist Workers' Party]], remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older ''Deutsche Turnverband'' and ''Schutzvereine'', the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', the Nazi ''[[Volkssport]]'' (1929) and the ''Bereitschaft''.\n\n==Rise of Nazis==\n<!--[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|left|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]-->\n[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by some Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-042-14, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Freikorps]]]]\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like [[Egerland]].\n\nOn 1 October 1933, [[Konrad Henlein]] with his deputy, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], aided by other members of the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The [[Sudeten German Home Front]] (''Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront'') professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'') (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy.  Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with [[Nazi Germany]] and received material aid from [[Berlin]], which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a ''F\u00fchrer'' and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected.  By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] during the ''[[Anschluss]]''.  Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by [[Gustav Hacker]], merged with the SdP. [[German Christian Social People\u2019s Party|German Christian Socialists]] in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club.

In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=zimmermann>Zimmermann, Volker: 'Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat.

I believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September. The [[Munich Agreement]], signed September 29 by Britain, France, Germany and Italy and negotiated without Czechoslovak participation, only confirmed that decision and the negotiated details. Czechoslovakia ceded a German-defined maximalist extension of Sudetenland to Germany, including the [[\u0160koda Works]]; near [[Pilsen]], they had been Czechoslovakia's primary armaments factory.\n\nAs a result, Bohemia and Moravia lost about 38 percent of their combined area, and 3.65&nbsp;million inhabitants (2.82&nbsp;million Germans<ref name=\"bruntal.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141202131759/http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |archive-date=2014-12-02 |df= }}</ref> and approximately 513,000 - 750,000<ref name=\"bruntal.net\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohumildolezal.cz/texty/u074-08.htm|title=Fakta o vyhn\u00e1n\u00ed \u010cech\u016f ze Sudet|first=Bohumil|last=Dole\u017eal|date=|website=www.bohumildolezal.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Czechs to Germany).\n\n==Under Nazi rule==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13160, Beim Einmarsch deutscher Truppen in Eger.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sudeten Germans greeting Hitler with the [[Nazi salute]] after he crossed the border into Czechoslovakia in 1938.]]\n\nSome 250,000 Germans remained on the Czech side of the border, which later became part of the Reich by the establishment of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] under German governors and the German Army.  Almost all the Germans in these Czech territories were subsequently granted German citizenship,<ref>Smlouva mezi \u010cesko-Slovenskou republikou a N\u011bmeckou \u0159\u00ed\u0161\u00ed o ot\u00e1zk\u00e1ch st\u00e1tn\u00edho ob\u010danstv\u00ed a opce, law no. 300/1938 Sb.</ref> while most of the Germans in Slovakia obtained citizenship of the [[Slovak state]].\n\nWith the establishment of German rule, hundreds of thousands of Czechs who (under the policy of Czechification) had moved into the Sudetenland after 1919 left the area, some willingly.

About half a million Sudeten Germans joined the [[Nazi Party]], which amounted to 17.34% of the German population in the Sudetenland (the average in [[Nazi Germany]] was 7.85%). Because of their knowledge of the [[Czech language]], many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in the Nazi oppressive machinery such as the [[Gestapo]]. The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]], the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], German men in Slovakia usually served in the Slovak army, but more than 7,000 were members of paramilitary squads (''Freiwillige Schutzstaffeln'') and almost 2,000 volunteers joined the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.  After the beginning of the [[Slovak National uprising]] in late 1944, most of the young Germans in Slovakia were drafted in the German army, either with the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS. The very young and elderly were organized in ''Heimatschutz'', an equivalent of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' in Germany.  The Nazis ordered some of them to take action against the partisans; others participated in deportation of Slovak Jews.<ref>Littlejohn, David: ''Foreign Legions of the Third Reich''. 1994</ref>  The Nazis evacuated about 120,000 Germans (mostly women and children) to the [[Sudetenland]] and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]].<ref name=\"zimmermann\"/>\n\n==Expulsion and transfer==\n{{Main|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|Germans expelled from Bohemia and Moravia after the Second World War]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, when the Czechoslovak state was restored, the government expelled the majority of ethnic Germans (about 3 million altogether), in the belief that their behaviour had been a major cause of the war and subsequent destruction. In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches. Generally local authorities ordered the expulsions, which armed volunteers carried out.  In some cases the regular army initiated or assisted such expulsions.<ref>Biman, S. - C\u00edlek, R.: ''Posledn\u00ed mrtv\u00ed, prvn\u00ed \u017eiv\u00ed''. \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem 1989.

An estimated 1.6&nbsp;million \"ethnic Germans\" (most of them also had Czech ancestors; and even Czechs, who spoke mainly German over the last years), were deported from Czechoslovakia to the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American zone]] of what would become [[West Germany]].

Almost [[all Czechoslovak Jews]], most of whom spoke primarily German, were [[Holocaust|deported and murdered]] by authorities of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], a Nazi puppet state, authorities after the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]].\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the remainder of the German-speaking population [[expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia|was expelled]] from Czechoslovakia to Germany and Austria.\n\nThe area that became known as the Sudetenland possessed chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. The Bohemian border with [[Bavaria]] was inhabited primarily by Germans. The [[Upper Palatine Forest]], which extends along the Bavarian frontier and into the agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]], was an area of German settlement. [[Moravia]] contained patches of \"locked\" German territory to the north and south. More characteristic were the German [[language island]]s, which were towns inhabited by German minorities and surrounded by Czechs. Sudeten Germans were mostly [[Roman Catholics]], a legacy of centuries of [[Austrian Habsburg]] rule.\n\nNot all ethnic Germans lived in isolated and well-defined areas; for historical reasons, Czechs and Germans mixed in many places, and Czech-German bilingualism was quite common. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 19th century, Czechs and Germans began to create separate cultural, educational, political and economic institutions, which kept both groups semiisolated from each other. That form of separation continued until the end of the Second World War, when almost all Germans were expelled.\n\n[[File:Sudetendeutsche.png|thumb|200px|right|Czech districts by ethnic German population in 1930:<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistick\u00fd lexikon obc\u00ed v Republice \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 I.

Though they were living beyond the medieval [[Kingdom of Germany]], an independent German Bohemian awareness, however, was not widespread, and for a long time, it played no decisive role in everyday life. Individuals were usually seen as Bohemians, Moravians or Silesians. Defining events later in German Bohemian history were the [[Hussite Wars]], the occupation of Bohemia by the [[Czech Brethren]], the [[Thirty Years\u2019 War]], when the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were severely affected, which caused the immigration of further German settlers.\n\nAfter the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the 1526 [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] became King of Bohemia, which became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

Cities like Prague, however, saw more mixing between the ethnicities and also had large populations of [[Jews]]. Jews in Bohemia often spoke German and sometimes [[Yiddish]]. The famed writer [[Franz Kafka]] exemplifies the diversity of Bohemia since he was a German-speaking Prague-based Jew, but his surname was of Czech origin.<ref>Brod, Max (1960).

The preservation of German cultural dominance throughout [[Cisleithania]] had proved to be difficult and now seemed to be was utterly impossible.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nWith the agreement, the desire for an autonomous Czech subdivision was mounting. Both German Bohemians and Czechs were hoping for a constitutional solution to the demands, but Czech nationalist views remained a constant part of the Bohemian political sphere.

By 1863, out of 187 lecture courses, 22 were held in Czech, the remainder being in German. In 1864, some Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected that because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\nThe Czechs, however, were still not satisfied with bilingual status and proposed creating two separate constituent [[college]]s, one for the Germans and one for the Czechs. The Germans vetoed the proposal and called for a full division of the university. After long negotiations, it was divided into the German Charles-Ferdinand University and the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University.

Electoral officials were very careful to demarcate areas as clearly either German or Czech and to assure that there would be no conflict as to which ethnicity had a majority in any constituency. Nevertheless, that did not settle tensions among Czechs, who wanted to govern themselves from Prague.\n\nArchduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] came up with a plan, known as the [[United States of Greater Austria]], in 1909.

However, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand was assassinated]], and the [[First World War]] destroyed all hopes for a redrawn Cisleithania.\n\n==Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye==\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought about the partition of the multiethnic [[Austria-Hungary]] into its historical components, one of them, the [[Bohemian Kingdom]], forming the west of the newly-created Czechoslovakia. Czech politicians insisted on the traditional boundaries of the [[Bohemian Crown]] according to the principle of ''[[uti possidetis juris]]''. The new Czech state would thus have defensible mountain boundaries with Germany, but the highly-industrialised settlement areas of three million Germans would now be separated from Austria and come under Czech control.\n\nThe Austrian head of goverment, [[Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg]], wanted to divide Bohemia by setting up administrative counties (''Verwaltungskreisen''), which would be based on the nationalities of the population. On 26 September 1918, his successor, [[Max Hussarek von Heinlein]], offered the Czechs wide-ranging autonomy within Imperial and Royal Austria. However, because exiled Czechs had already achieved the entrance of the [[United States]] in the war as an associate power of the [[Triple Entente]]. Also, Austria was no longer considered to be a major power by the victors of the war.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n===Province of German Bohemia===\nOn 14 October, Raphael Pacher succeeded, together with the social democrat, Josef Seliger, to unite all German parties and members of parliament in Bohemia and Moravia into a coalition. In preparation for the foundation of the Republic of German Bohemia, the coalition, chaired by Pacher, appointed a committee of twelve members. One day after the proclamation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, on 29 October 1918, the [[Province of German Bohemia]] was formed with its capital in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Its first governor was Raphael Pacher, who transferred his office on 5 November to Rudolf Lodgman von Auen.\n\nThe Province of German Bohemia comprised a contiguous region in North and West Bohemia that stretched from the [[Egerland]] to the Braunau region along the border with the German Empire.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In South Bohemia the administrative unit of B\u00f6hmerwaldgau emerged, which was to be part of [[Upper Austria]]. German Bohemia in the [[Orlick\u00e9 hory|Eagle Mountains]] and in the area of [[Lan\u0161kroun|Landskron]] merged with the so-called \"Province of the Sudetenland\", which had radically different borders than the later understanding of the term. The Bohemian district of [[Nov\u00e1 Byst\u0159ice|Neubistritz]] was incorporated into [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and was supposed to be administered by Lower Austria. The judiciary for German Bohemia was based in Reichenberg, and [[Vienna]] was responsible for the other German regions.\nOn 22 November 1918, the Province of German Bohemia proclaimed itself part of the state of [[German Austria]]. On the same day, the territory of German Austria was defined by the Act of the \"Provisional National Assembly\" (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung''), which included German Bohemian and German Moravian members of the former [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]].<ref>[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?apm=0&aid=sgb&datum=19180004&seite=00000051&size=45 Act, StGBl.

The German Bohemians relied mostly on peaceful opposition to the occupation of their homeland by the Czech military, which started on 31 October 1918 and was completed on 28 January 1919. Fighting took place sporadically, resulting in the deaths of a few dozen Germans and Czechs.\n\nOn 4 March 1919, almost the entire ethnic German population peacefully demonstrated for its right to self-determination.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The demonstrations were accompanied by a one-day general strike. The [[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic]], then the largest party, was responsible for the demonstration initiative, but it was also supported by other bourgeois German parties. The mass demonstrations were put down by the Czech military, involving 54 deaths and 84 wounded.<ref>[http://www.cas.umn.edu/assets/pdf/wp061.pdf Suppan, Arnold: ''Austrians, Czechs, and Sudeten Germans as a Community of Conflict in the Twentieth Century'', p. 9]</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], on 10 September 1919, made it clear that German Bohemia would not become part of the new [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]]. Instead, it would become part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The new state regarded ethnic Germans as an [[ethnic minority]]. Nevertheless, some 90 percent lived in territories in which they represented 90 percent or more of the population.\n\n===Demography===\nIn 1921, the population of multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia comprised 6.6&nbsp;million Czechs, 3.2&nbsp;million Germans, two million [[Slovaks]], 0.7&nbsp;million [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], half a million [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyns), 300,000 [[Jew]]s, and 100,000 [[Poles]], as well as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Croats]] and other ethnic groups.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated5 /> German-speakers represented a third of the population of the [[Czech lands|Bohemian lands]] and about 23.4 percent of the population of the whole republic (13.6&nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\nThe Sudetenland possessed huge chemical works and [[lignite]] mines as well as textile, china, and glass factories. To the west, a triangle of historic ethnic German settlement surrounding [[Cheb|Eger]] was the most active area for pan-German nationalism.  \nThe [[Upper Palatinate Forest]], an area that was primarily populated by Germans, extended along the Bavarian frontier to the poor agricultural areas of southern [[Bohemia]].\n\n[[Moravia]] contained many patches of ethnic German settlement in the north and the south. Most typical in those areas were German \"language islands\", towns inhabited by ethnic Germans but surrounded by rural Czechs.  Extreme German nationalism was never prevalent in those areas. German nationalism in the coal-mining region of southern [[Silesia]], which was 40.5% German, was restrained by fear of competition from industry in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n==Gradual general acceptance of Czechoslovak citizenship==\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|250px|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\nMany Germans felt that the new constitution failed to fulfill what the Czechs had promised in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] because there were too few minority rights. However, they gradually accepted remaining in Czechoslovakia and took part in the first elections in 1920. In 1926, the first Germans became minister ([[Robert Mayr-Harting]] and [[Franz Spina]]), and the first German political party became part of the government ([[German Christian Social People's Party]] and [[Farmers' League]]).<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/talking/hitlers-fifth-column \"Hitler's Fifth Column\"]. Radio Prague. December 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nGerman nationalist sentiment ran high during the early years of the republic. Sudeten representatives tried to join Austria or Germany or at least to obtain as much autonomy. The constitution of 1920 was drafted without Sudeten German representation,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and Sudetens declined to participate in the election of the president. Sudeten political parties pursued an \"obstructionist\" (or negativist) policy in the Czechoslovak parliament. In 1926, however, German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]], adopting a policy of rapprochement with the West, advised the Sudeten Germans to co-operate actively with the Czechoslovak government. In consequence, most Sudeten German parties (including the German Agrarian Party, the German Social Democratic Party and the German Christian Socialist People's Party) changed their policy from negativism to activism, and several Sudeten politicians even accepted cabinet posts.\n\n[[File:1._m\u00e1j_1938_v_Liberci_2.gif|thumb|250px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] on 1 May 1938 in [[Liberec]]]]\nAt a party conference in [[Teplitz]] in 1919, the provincial Social Femocratic Parties of Bohemia, Moravia and Sudeten-Silesia united to form the ''[[German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic|Deutsche Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei]]'' (DSAP) and elected Josef Seliger as chairman. After Seliger's untimely death in 1920, [[Ludwig Czech]] became party chairman, who was succeeded in 1938 by [[Wenzel Jaksch]].\n\nAlready in 1936, Jaksch, together with [[Hans Sch\u00fctz]] of the [[German Christian Social People's Party]] (''Deutsche Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei'') and [[Gustav Hacker]] of the Farmers' Association (''Bund der Landwirte'', formed the ''[[Jungaktivisten]]'' (Young Activists). They sought agreement with the Czechoslovak government on a policy that could withstand the Nazi onslaught from within and from outside Czechoslovakia. At simultaneous mass rallies in [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn|Tetschen-Bodenbach/D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]], [[\u017datec|Saaz/\u017datec]] and [[Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch|Ole\u0161nice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch/Gie\u00dfh\u00fcbl im Adlergebirge]] on April 26, 1936, they demanded equal opportunities in civil service for Germans, financial assistance for German businesses, official acceptance of the [[German language]] for public servants in the Sudetenland and measures to reduce unemployment in the Sudetenland. (At the time, one in three was unemployed in the Sudetenland, compared to one in five in the rest of the country.) Improving the quality of life of the Sudeten Germans was not the only motivation of the Jungaktivists. For Jaksch and his social democratic compatriots, it was a question of survival after a possible Nazi takeover. Of some 80,000 social democrats in Czechoslovakia, only about 5,000 would manage to flee the Nazis. The rest were incarcerated, and many of them were executed. Many of those who survived the Nazi persecution were later expelled, together with other Sudeten Germans, on the basis of [[Bene\u0161 decrees]].\n\nBy 1929, only a small number of Sudeten German deputies, most of them members of the German National Party, supported by the propertied classes, and the [[German National Socialist Workers' Party (Czechoslovakia)|German National Socialist Workers' Party]], remained opposed to the Czechoslovak government. Nationalist sentiment flourished, however, among Sudeten German youths, who had a variety of organizations, such as the older ''Deutsche Turnverband'' and ''Schutzvereine'', the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', the Nazi ''[[Volkssport]]'' (1929) and the ''Bereitschaft''.\n\n==Rise of Nazis==\n<!--[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|left|Flag flown by Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]-->\n[[File:Flag of Province Sudetenland.svg|thumb|Flag flown by some Sudeten Germans|alt=Flag with black, red and black horizontal bars]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-042-14, Anschluss sudetendeutscher Gebiete.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps|Sudeten German Freikorps]]]]\nThe Sudeten German nationalists, particularly the Nazis, expanded their activities after the Depression started. On 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed chancellor of Germany. The Czechoslovak government prepared to suppress the Sudeten Nazi Party. In the autumn of 1933, the Sudeten Nazis dissolved their organization, and the German Nationals were pressured to do likewise. The government expelled German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis from local government positions. The Sudeten German population was indignant, especially in nationalist strongholds like [[Egerland]].\n\nOn 1 October 1933, [[Konrad Henlein]] with his deputy, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], aided by other members of the ''[[Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)|Kameradschaftsbund]]'', a youth organization of mystical orientation, created a new political organisation. The [[Sudeten German Home Front]] (''Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront'') professed loyalty to Czechoslovakia but championed decentralization. It absorbed most former German Nationals and Sudeten Nazis.\n\nIn 1935, the Sudeten German Home Front became the [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'') (SdP) and embarked on an active propaganda campaign. In the May election, the SdP won more than 60% of the Sudeten German vote. The German Agrarians, Christian Socialists and Social Democrats each lost approximately half of their followers. The SdP became the centre of German nationalist forces. The party represented itself as striving for a just settlement of Sudeten German claims within the framework of Czechoslovak democracy.  Henlein, however, maintained secret contact with [[Nazi Germany]] and received material aid from [[Berlin]], which told him to refuse every concession offered by Czechoslovakia. The SdP endorsed the idea of a ''F\u00fchrer'' and mimicked Nazi methods with banners, slogans and uniformed troops. Concessions offered by the Czechoslovak government, including the installation of exclusively Sudeten German officials in Sudeten German areas and the possible participation of the SdP in the cabinet, were rejected.  By 1937, most SdP leaders supported Hitler's pan-German objectives.\n\nOn 13 March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] during the ''[[Anschluss]]''.  Immediately, many Sudeten Germans supported Henlein. On 22 March, the German Agrarian Party, led by [[Gustav Hacker]], merged with the SdP. [[German Christian Social People\u2019s Party|German Christian Socialists]] in Czechoslovakia suspended their activities on 24 March; their deputies and senators entered the SdP parliamentary club.

In the Carlsbad Decrees, issued on 24 April, the SdP demanded complete autonomy for the Sudetenland and freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If Henlein's demands had been granted, the Sudetenland would have been in a position to align itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nAs the political situation worsened, the security in Sudetenland deteriorated. The region became the site of small-scale clashes between young SdP followers,equipped with arms smuggled from Germany, and police and border forces. In some places, the regular army was called in to pacify the situation. Nazi propaganda accused the Czech government and Czechs of atrocities on innocent Germans. The Czechoslovaki public started to prepare for an inevitable war such as by training with gas masks.\n\nOn 20 May, Czechoslovakia initiated a so-called \"partial mobilization\" (literally \"special military precaution\") in response to rumours of German troop movements. The army moved into position on the border. Western powers tried to calm down the situation and forced Czechoslovakia to comply with most of the Carlsbad Decrees. However the SdP, instructed to continue to push towards war, escalated the situation with more protests and violence.\n\nWith the help of special Nazi forces, the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) took over some border areas and committed many crimes: they killed more than 110 Czechoslovaks (mostly soldiers and policemen) and kidnapped over 2,020 Czechoslovak citizens (including German antifascists), taking them to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=zimmermann>Zimmermann, Volker: 'Die Sudetendeutschen im NS-Staat.

I believe these complaints to be in the main justified. Even as late as the time of my Mission, I could find no readiness on the part of the Czechoslovak Government to remedy them on anything like an adequate scale... the feeling among the Sudeten Germans until about three or four years ago was one of hopelessness. But the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope. I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n\nBritain and France then pressured the Czechoslovak government into ceding the Sudetenland to Germany on 21 September. The [[Munich Agreement]], signed September 29 by Britain, France, Germany and Italy and negotiated without Czechoslovak participation, only confirmed that decision and the negotiated details. Czechoslovakia ceded a German-defined maximalist extension of Sudetenland to Germany, including the [[\u0160koda Works]]; near [[Pilsen]], they had been Czechoslovakia's primary armaments factory.\n\nAs a result, Bohemia and Moravia lost about 38 percent of their combined area, and 3.65&nbsp;million inhabitants (2.82&nbsp;million Germans<ref name=\"bruntal.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141202131759/http://www.bruntal.net/2007072602-k-otazce-vysidleni-obcanu-csr-ze-sudet-tesinska-podkarpatske-rusi-a-slovenske-republiky-v-letech-1938-1939 |archive-date=2014-12-02 |df= }}</ref> and approximately 513,000 - 750,000<ref name=\"bruntal.net\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohumildolezal.cz/texty/u074-08.htm|title=Fakta o vyhn\u00e1n\u00ed \u010cech\u016f ze Sudet|first=Bohumil|last=Dole\u017eal|date=|website=www.bohumildolezal.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Czechs to Germany).\n\n==Under Nazi rule==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13160, Beim Einmarsch deutscher Truppen in Eger.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Sudeten Germans greeting Hitler with the [[Nazi salute]] after he crossed the border into Czechoslovakia in 1938.]]\n\nSome 250,000 Germans remained on the Czech side of the border, which later became part of the Reich by the establishment of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] under German governors and the German Army.  Almost all the Germans in these Czech territories were subsequently granted German citizenship,<ref>Smlouva mezi \u010cesko-Slovenskou republikou a N\u011bmeckou \u0159\u00ed\u0161\u00ed o ot\u00e1zk\u00e1ch st\u00e1tn\u00edho ob\u010danstv\u00ed a opce, law no. 300/1938 Sb.</ref> while most of the Germans in Slovakia obtained citizenship of the [[Slovak state]].\n\nWith the establishment of German rule, hundreds of thousands of Czechs who (under the policy of Czechification) had moved into the Sudetenland after 1919 left the area, some willingly.

About half a million Sudeten Germans joined the [[Nazi Party]], which amounted to 17.34% of the German population in the Sudetenland (the average in [[Nazi Germany]] was 7.85%). Because of their knowledge of the [[Czech language]], many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] as well as in the Nazi oppressive machinery such as the [[Gestapo]]. The most notable was [[Karl Hermann Frank]], the SS and Police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], German men in Slovakia usually served in the Slovak army, but more than 7,000 were members of paramilitary squads (''Freiwillige Schutzstaffeln'') and almost 2,000 volunteers joined the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.  After the beginning of the [[Slovak National uprising]] in late 1944, most of the young Germans in Slovakia were drafted in the German army, either with the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS. The very young and elderly were organized in ''Heimatschutz'', an equivalent of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' in Germany.  The Nazis ordered some of them to take action against the partisans; others participated in deportation of Slovak Jews.<ref>Littlejohn, David: ''Foreign Legions of the Third Reich''. 1994</ref>  The Nazis evacuated about 120,000 Germans (mostly women and children) to the [[Sudetenland]] and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]].<ref name=\"zimmermann\"/>\n\n==Expulsion and transfer==\n{{Main|Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Vertreibung.jpg|thumb|Germans expelled from Bohemia and Moravia after the Second World War]]\nIn the aftermath of World War II, when the Czechoslovak state was restored, the government expelled the majority of ethnic Germans (about 3 million altogether), in the belief that their behaviour had been a major cause of the war and subsequent destruction. In the months directly following the end of the war, \"wild\" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Several Czechoslovak statesmen encouraged such expulsions with polemical speeches. Generally local authorities ordered the expulsions, which armed volunteers carried out.  In some cases the regular army initiated or assisted such expulsions.<ref>Biman, S. - C\u00edlek, R.: ''Posledn\u00ed mrtv\u00ed, prvn\u00ed \u017eiv\u00ed''. \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem 1989. ({{ISBN|807047002X}})</ref> Several thousand Germans were murdered during the expulsion, and many more died from hunger and illness as a consequence of becoming refugees.\n\nThe regular transfer of ethnic nationals among nations, authorized according to the [[Potsdam Conference]], proceeded from 25 January 1946 until October 1946. An estimated 1.6&nbsp;million \"ethnic Germans\" (most of them also had Czech ancestors; and even Czechs, who spoke mainly German over the last years), were deported from Czechoslovakia to the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American zone]] of what would become [[West Germany]]. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the [[Soviet zone]] (in what would become [[East Germany]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/65421|title=Memories of World War II in the Czech Lands: the expulsion of Sudeten Germans - Radio Prague|author=|date=|website=radio.cz|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Estimates of casualties related to this expulsion range between 20,000 and 200,000 people, depending on source.<ref name = \"Time\">P.

He was the fifth child in a household of four boys and five girls. His father, Narayandas (\"Nav Narayan\") Raina, was the first person to have introduced [[houseboat]]s in the [[Kashmir Valley]].<https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/travelnews/story/51475/kashmir_a_short_history_houseboats>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchkashmir.org/2010/10/origin-of-kashmiri-house-boat-and-some.html|title=Search Kashmir - in bits and pieces.|last=Razdan|first=Vinayak|date=10 October 2010|website=Origin of Kashmir|publisher=Search Kashmir|access-date= 29 March 2016}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} His mother's name was Arnyamali Raina.\n\nAt the age of five he was introduced to the path of spirituality by his elder brother Maheshvaranath. Up to the age of eight his spiritual progress in the lineage of [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivam]] was monitored by his family priest, [[Pandit]] Swami Ram Joo (1854-1915), and later by his chief disciple Swami Mehatab Kak (1870?-1942). At the age of 19, it is said, he experienced a clear taste of [[Self-realisation]]. Shortly afterwards he left home, as he wrote, \"in search of the Supreme\" and moved to the famous [[ashram]] of Sadhamalyun (Sadhuganga) in [[Handwara]]. Persuaded by his father to return to Srinagar, he continued to study [[Sanskrit]] and [[Shaiva philosophy]] under the guidance of a scholar named Maheshwar Razdan.\n\nIn 1934-35, he moved to an isolated place above the village of Gupta Ganga near [[Nishat]] suburb of [[Srinagar]] where his parents built him a house. This was a place where [[Abhinavagupta]] had lived nine centuries before. In 1962 he moved down the hill to a place closer to the famous [[Dal Lake]] a few hundred metres from the [[Nishat Gardens]].\n\nAround the age of 30 he traveled in India, spending time on a [[Bombay]] beach and a short time with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Sevagram]] and then with [[Sri Aurobindo]] at [[Pondicherry]]. From there he found his way to [[Tiruvannamalai]] to meet [[Ramana Maharshi]]. There he spent some weeks and later commented; \"I felt those golden days were indeed divine\".\n\nLittle was known about the Swami for almost three decades (1930-1960), as it was his habit to spend the winter months in silence and seclusion. Still, in the summer he had occasional visits from both scholars and saints. The Indian Spiritual Master [[Meher Baba]] visited his ashram in 1944. In 1948 [[Lilian Silburn]] from the [[National Centre for Scientific Research]], Paris, visited the Swami. She would return regularly for the next ten years, during which time she studied the major texts of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy, all of which were published in French. It was through Silburn that [[Andr\u00e9 Padoux]], another prolific scholar of Kashmir Shaivism came to meet the Swami. [[Paul Reps]], the American artist, author and poet stumbled across the Ashram in 1957. With Swami Lakshmanjoo he studied the ancient text of ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra]]'', and later published the 112 practices of transcending in the fourth chapter of his book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''. This teaching also influenced [[Rajneesh|Osho]], and formed the basis of ''The Book of Secrets''. It was a few years later, in 1965, after attending a Sanskrit conference in [[Varanasi]], chaired by the renowned Sanskrit Tantra scholar [[Gopinath Kaviraj]], that the word quickly spread that the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism was alive and well, and fully embodied in the person of Swami Lakshmanjoo. [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] visited the Swami each summer from 1966 to 1969. The two saints formed a lasting relationship. Baba [[Muktananda]], of [[Siddha Yoga]] also visited on two occasions. Until his death in 1991, Swami Lakshmanjoo freely taught, giving  weekly lectures on the mystical and philosophical texts of Kashmir Shaivism.  Many of these lectures were audio recorded by John Hughes and later published. Lakshman Joo's interpretation of Kashmir Shavism attracted the attention of both Indian of western [[Indologist]]s. The Swami has correspondence with Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, [[Jaideva Singh]], [[Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo]], [[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], [[Jankinath Kaul|Jankinath Kaul \"Kamal\"]], [[Raniero Gnoli]], [[Alexis Sanderson]] and [[Mark Dyczkowski]]. \n\nIn 1991,  Swamiji traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by the Ishwar Ashram Trust, an organisation which was founded by him. The Ishwar Ashram Trust continues to publish works of the commentary of Shaivacharya Swami Lakshmanjoo on various Shaivite Text. <www.ishwarashramtrust.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2006/10/27/swami-lakshmanjoos-birth-centenary-celebtns-to-commence-from-to-tom-1161959813.html |title=Swami Lakshmanjoo's birth centenary |publisher=One India |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20060925/460681.html |title=International seminar on Kashmir Shaivism in Srinagar |publisher=Webindia123.com |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n* 1933 \u2013 ''[[Gitartha Samgraha]]'' ([[Abhinavagupta]]'s commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]])\n* 1943 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Sambpanchashika]]''\n* 1958 \u2013 ''Sri Kramanayadipika'' (Hindi) on the 12 Kali-s\n* 1964 \u2013 Hindi translation of [[Utpaladeva]]'s ''[[Shivastotravali]]''\n* 1982 \u2013 Lectures on practice and discipline in Kashmir Shaivism\n* 1985 \u2013 ''Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme'', edited by John Hughes (the essence of the first fifteen chapters of Abhinavagupta's ''Tantraloka'')\n* 1986 \u2013 Hindi commentary by Swami Lakshman Joo on Abhinavagupta's ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha''\n* 1987 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Panchastavi]]''\nPosthumously:\n* 1992 \u2013 ''Self Realization in Kashmir Shaivism, Oral Teachings of Swami Lakshmanjoo'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 English translation of ''[[Shiva Sutras]]'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 ''Shiva Sutras'' of Vasugupta along with original audio recordings\n* 2005 \u2013 ''Revelations on Grace and Spiritual Practice'', original audio and DVD recordings\n* 2006 \u2013 ''Trika Rahasya Prakriya'', Sanskrit verses with Hindi commentary\n* 2007 \u2013 ''[[Vijnana Bhairava]]'', original audio and transcript, introduction by John Hughes\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha'' of Abhinavagupta (Revisited), Chapters 1\u20136, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD\n* 2013 \u2013 ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101 in the Light of Kashmir Shaivism'', Chapters 1-18, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD \n* 2015 \u2013 ''Paramarthasara with Abhinavagupta's commentary'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original DVD and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka, chapter One'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript. \n* 2016 \u2013 ''Spanda Karika of Vasugupta, and Spanda Sandoha of Kshemaraja'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Stava Cintamani of Bhatta Narayana'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n\n=== Kashmir Shaivism \u2013 Library ===\n\nOver a period of nineteen years John Hughes recorded Lakshman Joo's translations of the following texts.

His father, Narayandas (\"Nav Narayan\") Raina, was the first person to have introduced [[houseboat]]s in the [[Kashmir Valley]].<https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/travelnews/story/51475/kashmir_a_short_history_houseboats>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchkashmir.org/2010/10/origin-of-kashmiri-house-boat-and-some.html|title=Search Kashmir - in bits and pieces.|last=Razdan|first=Vinayak|date=10 October 2010|website=Origin of Kashmir|publisher=Search Kashmir|access-date= 29 March 2016}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} His mother's name was Arnyamali Raina.\n\nAt the age of five he was introduced to the path of spirituality by his elder brother Maheshvaranath. Up to the age of eight his spiritual progress in the lineage of [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivam]] was monitored by his family priest, [[Pandit]] Swami Ram Joo (1854-1915), and later by his chief disciple Swami Mehatab Kak (1870?-1942). At the age of 19, it is said, he experienced a clear taste of [[Self-realisation]]. Shortly afterwards he left home, as he wrote, \"in search of the Supreme\" and moved to the famous [[ashram]] of Sadhamalyun (Sadhuganga) in [[Handwara]]. Persuaded by his father to return to Srinagar, he continued to study [[Sanskrit]] and [[Shaiva philosophy]] under the guidance of a scholar named Maheshwar Razdan.\n\nIn 1934-35, he moved to an isolated place above the village of Gupta Ganga near [[Nishat]] suburb of [[Srinagar]] where his parents built him a house. This was a place where [[Abhinavagupta]] had lived nine centuries before. In 1962 he moved down the hill to a place closer to the famous [[Dal Lake]] a few hundred metres from the [[Nishat Gardens]].\n\nAround the age of 30 he traveled in India, spending time on a [[Bombay]] beach and a short time with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Sevagram]] and then with [[Sri Aurobindo]] at [[Pondicherry]]. From there he found his way to [[Tiruvannamalai]] to meet [[Ramana Maharshi]]. There he spent some weeks and later commented; \"I felt those golden days were indeed divine\".\n\nLittle was known about the Swami for almost three decades (1930-1960), as it was his habit to spend the winter months in silence and seclusion. Still, in the summer he had occasional visits from both scholars and saints. The Indian Spiritual Master [[Meher Baba]] visited his ashram in 1944. In 1948 [[Lilian Silburn]] from the [[National Centre for Scientific Research]], Paris, visited the Swami. She would return regularly for the next ten years, during which time she studied the major texts of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy, all of which were published in French. It was through Silburn that [[Andr\u00e9 Padoux]], another prolific scholar of Kashmir Shaivism came to meet the Swami. [[Paul Reps]], the American artist, author and poet stumbled across the Ashram in 1957. With Swami Lakshmanjoo he studied the ancient text of ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra]]'', and later published the 112 practices of transcending in the fourth chapter of his book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''. This teaching also influenced [[Rajneesh|Osho]], and formed the basis of ''The Book of Secrets''. It was a few years later, in 1965, after attending a Sanskrit conference in [[Varanasi]], chaired by the renowned Sanskrit Tantra scholar [[Gopinath Kaviraj]], that the word quickly spread that the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism was alive and well, and fully embodied in the person of Swami Lakshmanjoo. [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] visited the Swami each summer from 1966 to 1969. The two saints formed a lasting relationship. Baba [[Muktananda]], of [[Siddha Yoga]] also visited on two occasions. Until his death in 1991, Swami Lakshmanjoo freely taught, giving  weekly lectures on the mystical and philosophical texts of Kashmir Shaivism.  Many of these lectures were audio recorded by John Hughes and later published. Lakshman Joo's interpretation of Kashmir Shavism attracted the attention of both Indian of western [[Indologist]]s. The Swami has correspondence with Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, [[Jaideva Singh]], [[Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo]], [[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], [[Jankinath Kaul|Jankinath Kaul \"Kamal\"]], [[Raniero Gnoli]], [[Alexis Sanderson]] and [[Mark Dyczkowski]]. \n\nIn 1991,  Swamiji traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by the Ishwar Ashram Trust, an organisation which was founded by him. The Ishwar Ashram Trust continues to publish works of the commentary of Shaivacharya Swami Lakshmanjoo on various Shaivite Text. <www.ishwarashramtrust.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2006/10/27/swami-lakshmanjoos-birth-centenary-celebtns-to-commence-from-to-tom-1161959813.html |title=Swami Lakshmanjoo's birth centenary |publisher=One India |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20060925/460681.html |title=International seminar on Kashmir Shaivism in Srinagar |publisher=Webindia123.com |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n* 1933 \u2013 ''[[Gitartha Samgraha]]'' ([[Abhinavagupta]]'s commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]])\n* 1943 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Sambpanchashika]]''\n* 1958 \u2013 ''Sri Kramanayadipika'' (Hindi) on the 12 Kali-s\n* 1964 \u2013 Hindi translation of [[Utpaladeva]]'s ''[[Shivastotravali]]''\n* 1982 \u2013 Lectures on practice and discipline in Kashmir Shaivism\n* 1985 \u2013 ''Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme'', edited by John Hughes (the essence of the first fifteen chapters of Abhinavagupta's ''Tantraloka'')\n* 1986 \u2013 Hindi commentary by Swami Lakshman Joo on Abhinavagupta's ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha''\n* 1987 \u2013 Hindi translation of ''[[Panchastavi]]''\nPosthumously:\n* 1992 \u2013 ''Self Realization in Kashmir Shaivism, Oral Teachings of Swami Lakshmanjoo'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 English translation of ''[[Shiva Sutras]]'', edited by John Hughes\n* 2002 \u2013 ''Shiva Sutras'' of Vasugupta along with original audio recordings\n* 2005 \u2013 ''Revelations on Grace and Spiritual Practice'', original audio and DVD recordings\n* 2006 \u2013 ''Trika Rahasya Prakriya'', Sanskrit verses with Hindi commentary\n* 2007 \u2013 ''[[Vijnana Bhairava]]'', original audio and transcript, introduction by John Hughes\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Bhagavad Gitartha Samgraha'' of Abhinavagupta (Revisited), Chapters 1\u20136, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD\n* 2013 \u2013 ''Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101 in the Light of Kashmir Shaivism'', Chapters 1-18, translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, DVD \n* 2015 \u2013 ''Paramarthasara with Abhinavagupta's commentary'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original DVD and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka, chapter One'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript. \n* 2016 \u2013 ''Spanda Karika of Vasugupta, and Spanda Sandoha of Kshemaraja'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Stava Cintamani of Bhatta Narayana'', translated by Swami Lakshmanjoo, original audio and transcript.\n\n=== Kashmir Shaivism \u2013 Library ===\n\nOver a period of nineteen years John Hughes recorded Lakshman Joo's translations of the following texts.
