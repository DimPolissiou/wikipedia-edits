He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique. Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, however,<ref>Hockney on Art \u2013 Paul Joyce {{ISBN|1-4087-0157-X}}</ref> he returned to painting.\n\n===Other technology===\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the [[Quantel Paintbox]], a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen.

He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique. Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, however,<ref>Hockney on Art \u2013 Paul Joyce {{ISBN|1-4087-0157-X}}</ref> he returned to painting.\n\n===Other technology===\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the [[Quantel Paintbox]], a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen.

The [[King of the Belgians]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] is the [[head of government]], in a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] of parliament, the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] and the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]]. The federation is made up of [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|(language-based) communities and (territorial) regions]]. [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]] is the seventh and current King of the Belgians, having ascended the throne on 21 July 2013.\n\nSince around 1970, the significant Belgian national [[political party|political parties]] have split into distinct representations for each communities' interests, besides defense of their ideologies. These parties belong to three main political families, though all close to the [[centrism|centre]]: the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Liberalism|Liberals]], the [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]] and the [[Social democracy|Socialists]] forming the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]. Other important newer parties are the [[worldwide green parties|Green parties]] and, nowadays mainly in [[Flanders]], the [[nationalist]] and [[far-right]] parties. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as [[trade union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s such as the [[Federation of Belgian Enterprises]]. Majority rule is often superseded by a ''de facto'' confederal decision-making process where the minority (the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speakers]]) enjoy important protections through [[Supermajority|specialty majorities]] (2/3 overall and majority in each of the 2 main communities). {{Democracy Index rating|Belgium|flawed democracy|2019}}\n\n==Constitution==\n{{Main|Constitution of Belgium|State reform in Belgium}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Belgium]], the primary source of law and the basis of the political system of the Country, was established on February 7, 1831. It has been changed several times, but the most relevant reforms were performed in 1970 and in 1993.\n\nIn 1970, in response to a growing civil conflict between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities in Brussels, the Government declared that \"the unitary state, its structure and functioning as laid down by law, had become obsolete\". The new constitution recognised the existence of strong communitarian and regional differences within [[Belgium]], but sought to reconcile these differences through a diffusion of power to the communities and the regions.\n\nIn 1993 the parliament approved a constitutional package transforming Belgium into a full-fledged [[federal state]].\n\n==Government==\n\n===Executive===\n{{Office-table}}\n| [[King of the Belgians|King]]\n| [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]]\n| {{n/a}}\n| 21 July 2013\n|-\n| [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]]\n| [[Sophie Wilm\u00e8s]]\n| [[Mouvement R\u00e9formateur|Reformist Movement]]\n| 27 October 2019\n|}\n\n====Head of state====\n{{Main|Monarchy of Belgium}}\n\n'''[[Monarchy of Belgium|The King of the Belgians]]''' is the constitutional head of the Belgian state and holds office for life. The duties of the king are laid out by the Belgian Constitution and other laws enforced under it.\n\nAs titular head of state, the King plays a ceremonial and symbolic role in the nation. His main political function is to designate a political leader to form a new cabinet after an [[election]] or the resignation of a cabinet. In conditions where there is a \"constructive vote of no-confidence,\" the [[government]] has to resign and the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|lower house]] of [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Parliament]] proposes a new [[Prime Minister]] to the King.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |title=Constitution of Belgium - Article 96 |publisher=Fed-parl.be |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403214530/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}</ref> The King is also seen as playing a symbolic unifying role, representing a common national Belgian identity.\n\n[[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]] succeeded his father [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] on 21 July 2013 upon his abdication.\n\n====Federal government====\n{{Main|Belgian federal government}}\n\nThe executive power is held by the [[Prime Minister]] and the [[Political minister|ministers]], who together form the Council of Ministers, and by the [[secretary of state#Belgium|secretaries of state]], each of whom is deputy to a minister and is part of the federal Government, but does not sit in the Council of Ministers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |title=Constitution of Belgium - Article 104 |publisher=Fed-parl.be |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403214530/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}</ref>\n\nMembers of the Federal Government, who are formally appointed by the King, are in fact drawn from the [[political party|political parties]] which form the government [[coalition government|coalition]].\n\nThe Federal Government must enjoy the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives.\n\nThe total number of Ministers, excluding the Prime Minister, cannot exceed 15. Also, the number of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers must be equal, with the possible exception of the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |title=Constitution of Belgium - Article 99 |publisher=Fed-parl.be |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403214530/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}</ref>\n\nMinisters head executive departments of the government. The Prime Minister and his ministers administer the government and the various [[public services]] and the ministers must defend their policies and performance in person before the Chamber.\n\n====Regional and community governments====\n\nThe regional and community parliaments and governments have jurisdiction over transportation, public works, water policy, cultural matters, education, public health, environment, housing, zoning, and economic and industrial policy. They rely on a system of revenue-sharing for funds. They have the authority to levy a very few taxes (mostly surcharges) and to contract loans. Moreover, they have obtained exclusive treaty-making power for those issues coming under their respective jurisdictions. Of total public spending (interest payments not considered), more than 30% is authorized by the regions and communities, although their financing comes for over 80% from national Belgian budgets; at the same time, the national government controls 100% of social security, and strictly limits the taxation policy by the federalized entities. As a result, Belgian institutions still control over 90% of the effective, global taxation levels on individuals and companies.\n\nThough since 1993 article 35 of the Constitution requires the creation a list specifying federal as opposed to regional and communities' competences, such list was never created. Therefore, the federal government continues to exercise all competences not explicitly dedicated to the lesser levels.<ref>\n{{cite magazine\n|author=Ann Peuteman\n|title=De staatshervorming, war moet dat heen?\n|magazine=Knack magazine\n|date=8 May 2008\n|issue=37th year, number 18\n|page=25\n|quote=In Belgi\u00eb is het voorlopig zo dat bevoegdheden die niet expliciet aan de gewesten of de gemeenschappen zijn toegewezen op federaal niveau worden uitgeoefend.

Maar dat is nooit gebeurd.', zegt [grondwetspecialist Patrick] Peeters.}}</ref>\n\nThe Flemish parties generally favour much larger community (and regional) autonomy, including financial and tax autonomy, while the francophone parties generally oppose it. The French-speaking parties tend to favour more state control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nAs of October 2019, the regional executives are the following:\n* [[Minister-President of Flanders|Minister-President of Flemish Government (Community+Region)]]: [[Jan Jambon]] (N-VA)\n* [[Minister-President of the French Community|Minister-President of French Community Government]]: [[Pierre-Yves Jeholet]] (MR)\n* [[Minister-President of the Walloon Region|Minister-President of Walloon Regional Government]]: [[Elio Di Rupo]] (PS)\n* [[Minister-President of the Brussels Capital-Region|Minister-President of Brussels-Capital Regional Government]]: [[Rudi Vervoort]] (PS)\n* [[Minister-President of the German-speaking Community|Minister-President of German Community Government]]: [[Oliver Paasch]] (ProDG)\n\n====Provincial and local government====\nThe two biggest regions, Flanders and Wallonia, are further subdivided into five [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] each. The Brussels-Capital Region is directly divided into 19 municipalities. In total, Belgium counts 589 [[municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]]. Provincial and local government is an exclusive competency of the regions. Therefore, one should see the relevant articles for more detailed information on provincial and local government.\n\nIn the Brussels region, there is another form of intermediate government, constituted by institutions from each of the two competent communities. Those institutions ([[COCOF]] for the French-speakers and [[Flemish Community Commission|VGC]] for the [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s) have similar competencies, although only COCOF has legislative powers, given by the French Community. For Brussels community matters common to both communities there is a [[Common Community Commission]].\n\n===Legislative===\n{{Main|Belgian federal parliament}}\nLegislative powers in Belgium are divided between the national, the regional and the community levels.\n\nThe Belgian Federal Parliament consists of the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Senaat''', [[French language|French]]: '''S\u00e9nat''') and the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers''', [[French language|French]]: '''Chambre des Repr\u00e9sentants'''). The Chamber has 150 members; the Senate has 60. All 150 representatives are elected directly via a system of proportional representation. The Senate consists of 50 senators elected by the parliaments of the communities and regions, and 10 senators co-opted by the others.\n\nSince the Constitutional reforms of 1993 and 2013, the two Houses of Parliament do not sit on a level of parity: other than in cases regarding the constitutional, institutional or federal structure or international relation, the consent of the Senate either is not required (so-called \"unicameral laws\", voted only by the House, such as the budget) or can be dispensed of by the House. The Chamber of Representatives is also the only house that votes the confidence to the Government.\n\nEach of the five components of the federal system ([[Flemish Community]], [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]], [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]], [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] and [[Brussels-Capital Region]]) have their own, directly elected [[unicameralism|unicameral]] council or parliament. They vote decrees (or ordinances in Brussels), that have the same value and are on the same juridical level as the federal laws.\n\nThe influence of the main political parties and party leaders is enormous. Many experts{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} estimate that the presidents of the main parties are considerably more powerful than both ordinary ministers and the entire Parliament. For this reason, the Belgian political system is often called a [[particracy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Judiciary===\n{{Main|Judiciary of Belgium}}\nThe judicial system is based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and originates from the [[Napoleonic code]]. It has a judicial review of legislative acts. It accepts compulsory [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] jurisdiction, with reservations. The [[Court of Appeals]] is one level below the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], an institution based on the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Court of Cassation]]. The [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] (Dutch: ''Hof van Cassatie'', French: ''Cour de Cassation'') is the most important court in Belgium. Judges are appointed for life by the Belgian monarch.\n\n==Elections and parties==\n{{Main|Elections in Belgium}}\n\n===Electoral system===\nThe election for the Belgian Chamber of Representatives is based on a system of [[open list]] [[proportional representation]]. Several months before an election, each party forms a list of candidates for each district. Parties are allowed to place as many candidates on their lists as there are seats available. The formation of the list is an internal process that varies with each party. The place on the list is considered to play a role in the election of a candidate, by giving stronger visibility to those high on the list; this phenomenon, however, seems to have lost importance since the last electoral reform.\n\nBelgian voters are given five options. They may:\n* Vote for a list as a whole, thereby showing approval of the order established by the party;\n* Vote for one or more individual candidates, regardless of his/her ranking on the list (a \"preference vote\");\n* Vote for one or more of the \"alternates\" (substitutes);\n* Vote for one or more candidates, and one or more alternates;\n* Vote invalid or blank so no one receives the vote.\n\nWhile there are some options to vote on more than one person, voters cannot vote for candidates of more than one candidate list (party). Doing so makes the vote invalid.\n\nPolitical campaigns in Belgium are relatively short, lasting only about one month. They are subjected to several limitations:\n* There are restrictions on the use of [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]].\n* For all of their activities, campaigns included, the political parties have to rely on government subsidies and dues paid by their members.\n* An electoral expenditures law restricts expenditures during the campaign.\n\nBelgium is one of the few countries that has [[compulsory voting]], thus having one of the highest rates of [[voter turnout]] in the world.<ref>[[Voter turnout|Election turnout]] in national lower house elections from 1960 to 1995, numbers from Mark N. Franklin's \"Electoral Participation.\"</ref>\n\nElections for the Chamber of Representatives (Federal Parliament) are normally held every five years and coincide with those for the [[European Parliament]]. Before 2014, they were held every four years and were held separately.\nThe community and regional parliaments are elected every five years, and their elections coincide with those for the European Parliament as well.\nElections for the members of Belgium's municipal and provincial councils are held every six years.\n\nThe [[2012 Belgian local elections|latest municipal and provincial elections]] were held in 2012 and the latest [[2014 Belgian federal election|federal]] and [[2014 Belgian regional elections|regional elections]] were held in 2014.\n\n===Results from last Chamber election (2014)===\n{{Belgian chamber election, 2014}}\n\n===Political parties===\nIn Belgium, aside from a few minor German-speaking parties, most political parties are either Dutch-speaking (Flemish) or French-speaking; the only major bilingual party operating across all of Belgium is The Workers Party of Party of Belgium (PVDA+/PTB)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://europeelects.eu/european-union/belgium/|title=Belgium|website=Europe Elects|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>, a far-left party who first won seats in the Chamber in 2014 and as of 2019 have 3 seats in Dutch speaking Flanders and 9 seats in Brussels and Wallonia.\n\nAnother important characteristic of Belgian national politics is the highly federal nature of decision making. Important decisions require both a national majority (2/3 for constitutional changes), as well as majorities in the two main language groups. On top of that, both these communities can activate 'alarm bell'-procedures, delaying changes. In addition, there are no national parties to speak of. As a result of this, Belgian decision making can be slow and expensive. On top, it tends to significantly favour the more conservative parties. Given the historically very high public expenditure, and the very strict central control over taxation, even for revenues going to regions and communities, the tendency of Belgian governments to lower taxation and especially labour charges has been limited, at least if compared to radical-liberal approaches followed by certain other countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====History of the political landscape====\nFrom the creation of the Belgian state in 1830 and throughout most of the 19th century, two political parties dominated Belgian politics: the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] (Church-oriented and [[conservatism|conservative]]) and the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] ([[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and [[progressivism|progressive]]). In the late 19th century the [[Belgian Labour Party|Socialist Party]] arose to represent the emerging industrial working class. These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character.\n\nIn the years before and after the Second World War, the linguistic problem became a stronger divisive issue in Belgian politics, with the emergence in the 1950s and 1960s of linguistic parties ([[People's Union (Belgium)|Volksunie]], [[Democratic Front of Francophones|FDF]] and [[Walloon Rally|Rassemblement Wallon]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, each of the main political parties of Belgium split into Flemish and French-speaking parties.\n\nAfter [[Protests of 1968|May 68]], the country saw a growing environmental and left wing movement, that led to the foundation of the ecological parties [[Green!|Groen!]] and [[Ecolo]].\n\nEspecially in Flanders, the 1980s saw the growth of the far right, represented by the [[Vlaams Belang]], which became one of the larger parties of the country in the 1990s.\n\nDuring the years surrounding the new millennium, an attempt at restructuring the political landscape took place, mainly taking the form of political [[Kartel (electoral alliance)|cartels]].\n\n====Main political parties====\n{{Main|Political parties in Belgium|Political parties in Flanders}}\n\nMain Flemish parties:\n* [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&V)\n* [[Groen (political party)|Groen]]\n* [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA)\n* [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open Vld)\n* [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialist Party \u2013 Differently]] (sp.a)\n* [[Vlaams Belang]]\n\nMain French-speaking parties:\n* [[Ecolo]]\n* [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ralistes D\u00e9mocrates Francophones|Francophone Democratic Federalists]] (FDF)\n* [[Centre d\u00e9mocrate humaniste|Humanist Democratic Centre]] (cdH)\n* [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS)\n* [[Mouvement R\u00e9formateur|Reformist Movement]] (MR)\n\nGerman-speaking parties:\n* [[Christlich Soziale Partei (Belgium)|Christian Social Party]] (CSP)\n* [[Partei f\u00fcr Freiheit und Fortschritt|Party for Freedom and Progress]] (PFF)\n* [[ProDG (Belgium)|ProDG]]\n\n===Latest electoral results and government formation===\n{{See also|List of elections in Belgium}}\n* [[2018 Belgian local elections]]\n* [[2019 Belgian regional elections]]\n* [[2019 Belgian federal election]]\n* [[2019 European Parliament election in Belgium]]\n* [[2019 Belgian government formation]]\n\n==Trade unions==\nBelgium is a highly [[trade union|unionised]] country, and organised labour is a powerful influence in politics. About 53% of all private sector and public service employees are labour union members. Not simply a \"bread and butter\" movement in the American sense, Belgian labour unions take positions on education, public finance, defence spending, environmental protection, women's rights, [[abortion]], and other issues. They also provide a range of services, including the administration of unemployment benefits.\n\nBelgium's three principal trade union organizations are the [[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (CSC/ACV) (1,705,000 members), the [[General Federation of Belgian Labour]] (FGTB/ABVV) (1,198,000 members) and the [[General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium]] (CGSLB/ACLVB) which has 230,000 members.\n\nUntil the fifties, the FGTB/ABVV was the largest confederation, since then, however, the CSC/ACV has become the leading trade union force. In the most recent works council elections held in 2004 the CSC/ACV garnered close to 53% of the vote, the Socialist confederation obtained 36%, and the Liberal confederation 10%.\n\nThe Confederation of Catholic labour Unions (CSC/ACV). Organised in 1912, the CSC/ACV rejects the Marxist concept of \"class struggle\" and seeks to achieve a just social order based on Christian principles. The CSC/ACV is not formally linked to its party political counterparts, the Christian Democratic parties (CD&V and CDH), but exercises great influence in their councils.\n\nThe CSC/ACV is the leading union in all Flemish provinces, and in Wallonia's [[Luxembourg (province of Belgium)|Luxembourg province]]. It has almost equal strength with the socialist confederation in the Brussels area. Its President is currently {{ill|Luc Cortebeeck|nl}}.\n\nThe Belgian Socialist Confederation of labour (FGTB/ABVV). The FGTB/ABVV derives from the Socialist Trade Union Movement, established in the late 19th century in Walloon industrial areas, Brussels, and urban areas of Flanders. Today the FGTB/ABVV is the leading union in the [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Namur (province)|Namur]], and [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] provinces and matches the CSC/ACV in Brussels. The FGTB/ABVV is led by President Michel Nollet.\n\n==Linguistic division==\n{{Main|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium | Partition of Belgium}}\n\nBelgium is a country in which language is a major political issue. In the 19th and early 20th century, [[Flemish people|Flemings]] did not enjoy the same rights as French-speakers, both [[de facto]] and [[de jure]]. When the country was founded in 1830 under a census voting system, only around 1% of the adult population could vote: nobility, haute-bourgeoisie and higher clerics, all of them French-speaking. A Flemish movement fought peacefully to gain equal rights, obtaining most of these. Minor issues exist also between German- and French-speakers.\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, Germanic [[Franks]] migrated into what is now Belgium. The less populated northern areas became Germanic, while in the southern part, where the Roman presence had been much stronger, [[Latin]] persisted despite the migrations of the Franks. This linguistic frontier has more or less endured.\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and the 19th century further accentuated the North-South division. Francophone Wallonia became an early industrial boom area, affluent and politically dominant. Dutch-speaking Flanders remained agricultural and was economically and politically outdistanced by Wallonia and the capital. The elite during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century spoke French, even in the Dutch-speaking area. In the 20th century, and particularly after the Second World War, Flanders saw an economic flowering while Wallonia became economically stagnant. As Flemings became more educated and more well off, and sought a fair and equal share of political power, tensions between the two communities rose.\n\nLinguistic demonstrations in the early 1960s led in 1962 to the establishment of a formal linguistic border and elaborate rules were made to protect minorities in linguistically mixed border areas. In 1970, the Constitution was amended. Flemish and francophone cultural councils were established with authority in matters relating to language and culture for the two language groups.\n\nThe 1970 constitutional revision did not finally settle the problem, however. A controversial amendment declared that Belgium consists of three cultural communities (the [[Flemish Community]], the [[French Community of Belgium|French(-speaking) Community]] and the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]]) and three economic regions ([[Flanders]], [[Wallonia]], and [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]]) each to be granted a significant measure of political autonomy. It was not until 1980, however, that an agreement could be reached on how to implement this new constitutional provision.\n\nIn August 1980, the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]] passed a devolution bill and amended the [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution]], establishing:\n* A Flemish community legislative assembly (council) and Flemish government;\n* A Francophone community legislative council and government competent for cultural, language, and educational matters; and\n* Walloon and Flemish regional legislative assemblies and governments competent for regional economic matters.\n\nImmediately, the [[Flemish people|Flemings]] had their regional legislative council and government transfer its competencies to the community legislative council and government. That became competent for both cultural, language, and educational affairs, and for regional economic matters.\n\nSince 1984 the [[German-speaking community of Belgium|German language community of Belgium]] (in the eastern part of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] Province) has had its own legislative assembly and executive, competent for cultural, language, and educational affairs.\n\nIn 1988-89 the [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution]] was again amended to give additional responsibilities to the regions and communities. The most sweeping change was to devolve nearly all responsibilities for educational matters to the communities. Moreover, the regions and communities were provided additional revenue, and Brussels Region was given its own legislative assembly and executive.\n\nAnother important constitutional reform took place in the summer of 1993. It formally changed Belgium from a unitary to a [[federalism|federal]] state. It also (modestly) reformed the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliamentary system and provided for the direct election of the members of the community and regional legislative councils. The bilingual Brabant province was split into separate [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]] provinces, whereas in the Brussels-Capital Region most of the elsewhere provincial powers are exercised by the region and the responsibilities of an elsewhere provincial governor towards the federal level, by the [[Governor of Brussels-Capital]]. However, the electoral and judicial districts of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde were not split.\n\nDespite the numerous constitution revisions, the matter is not completely settled. There is still a lot of political tension between French-speakers and Dutch-speakers, and, to a lesser degree, between French-speakers and the politically far weaker German-speakers.\n\n===Shift from linguistic to cultural and political animosity===\nAt the end of the 20th century, it became clear that the main opposition between [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s and [[Walloons]] was not primarily linguistic anymore, but had shifted to major political and demographic differences. Flemish parties appear much more '[[Anglo-Saxon economy (economic model)|Anglo-Saxon]]' in policy choices, moving away from 'big state' philosophies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} French-speaking parties, including their 'right-wing' parties, tend to favor big government and state support for the poor.\n\nThis became very obvious after the 2007 elections: in [[Flanders]], the classical left-wing parties only captured 1/4 of the votes. On the French-speaking side, the left still carried 1/2 of the votes. One of the key differences centers on the policy towards everyone receiving allocations. Flemings strongly favor a policy focused at helping them regain their autonomy.\n\n==International organization participation==\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\nBelgium is member of [[Agence de Coop\u00e9ration Culturelle et Technique|ACCT]], [[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[Australia Group]], [[Benelux]], [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[CERN]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[European Investment Bank|EIB]], [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]], [[European Space Agency|ESA]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Group of 9|G-9]], [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]], [[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[International Mobile Satellite Organization|Inmarsat]], [[Intelsat]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[NATO]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]], [[Nuclear Suppliers Group|NSG]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]] ([[Observer status|observer]]), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan|UNMOGIP]], [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UNMOP]], [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[West African Development Bank|WADB]] (nonregional), [[World Confederation of Labour|WCL]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[Western European Union|WEU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTrO]] and the [[Zangger Committee]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Belgian order of precedence]]\n* [[2014 Belgian government formation]]\n* [[2010\u201311 Belgian government formation]]\n* [[Belgian Official Journal|Belgian official journal]]\n* [[Corruption in Belgium]]\n* [[List of governments in Belgium]]\n* [[Politics of Flanders]]\n* [[Politics of Wallonia]]\n* [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium]]\n* [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Billiet\n | first = Jaak\n |author2=Bart Maddens |author3=Andr\u00e9-Paul Frognier\n |date= November 2006\n | title = Does Belgium (still) exist?

The [[King of the Belgians]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] is the [[head of government]], in a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] of parliament, the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] and the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]]. The federation is made up of [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|(language-based) communities and (territorial) regions]]. [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]] is the seventh and current King of the Belgians, having ascended the throne on 21 July 2013.\n\nSince around 1970, the significant Belgian national [[political party|political parties]] have split into distinct representations for each communities' interests, besides defense of their ideologies. These parties belong to three main political families, though all close to the [[centrism|centre]]: the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Liberalism|Liberals]], the [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]] and the [[Social democracy|Socialists]] forming the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]. Other important newer parties are the [[worldwide green parties|Green parties]] and, nowadays mainly in [[Flanders]], the [[nationalist]] and [[far-right]] parties. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as [[trade union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s such as the [[Federation of Belgian Enterprises]]. Majority rule is often superseded by a ''de facto'' confederal decision-making process where the minority (the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speakers]]) enjoy important protections through [[Supermajority|specialty majorities]] (2/3 overall and majority in each of the 2 main communities). {{Democracy Index rating|Belgium|flawed democracy|2019}}\n\n==Constitution==\n{{Main|Constitution of Belgium|State reform in Belgium}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Belgium]], the primary source of law and the basis of the political system of the Country, was established on February 7, 1831. It has been changed several times, but the most relevant reforms were performed in 1970 and in 1993.\n\nIn 1970, in response to a growing civil conflict between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities in Brussels, the Government declared that \"the unitary state, its structure and functioning as laid down by law, had become obsolete\". The new constitution recognised the existence of strong communitarian and regional differences within [[Belgium]], but sought to reconcile these differences through a diffusion of power to the communities and the regions.\n\nIn 1993 the parliament approved a constitutional package transforming Belgium into a full-fledged [[federal state]].\n\n==Government==\n\n===Executive===\n{{Office-table}}\n| [[King of the Belgians|King]]\n| [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]]\n| {{n/a}}\n| 21 July 2013\n|-\n| [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]]\n| [[Sophie Wilm\u00e8s]]\n| [[Mouvement R\u00e9formateur|Reformist Movement]]\n| 27 October 2019\n|}\n\n====Head of state====\n{{Main|Monarchy of Belgium}}\n\n'''[[Monarchy of Belgium|The King of the Belgians]]''' is the constitutional head of the Belgian state and holds office for life. The duties of the king are laid out by the Belgian Constitution and other laws enforced under it.\n\nAs titular head of state, the King plays a ceremonial and symbolic role in the nation. His main political function is to designate a political leader to form a new cabinet after an [[election]] or the resignation of a cabinet. In conditions where there is a \"constructive vote of no-confidence,\" the [[government]] has to resign and the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|lower house]] of [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Parliament]] proposes a new [[Prime Minister]] to the King.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |title=Constitution of Belgium - Article 96 |publisher=Fed-parl.be |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403214530/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}</ref> The King is also seen as playing a symbolic unifying role, representing a common national Belgian identity.\n\n[[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]] succeeded his father [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] on 21 July 2013 upon his abdication.\n\n====Federal government====\n{{Main|Belgian federal government}}\n\nThe executive power is held by the [[Prime Minister]] and the [[Political minister|ministers]], who together form the Council of Ministers, and by the [[secretary of state#Belgium|secretaries of state]], each of whom is deputy to a minister and is part of the federal Government, but does not sit in the Council of Ministers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |title=Constitution of Belgium - Article 104 |publisher=Fed-parl.be |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403214530/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}</ref>\n\nMembers of the Federal Government, who are formally appointed by the King, are in fact drawn from the [[political party|political parties]] which form the government [[coalition government|coalition]].\n\nThe Federal Government must enjoy the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives.\n\nThe total number of Ministers, excluding the Prime Minister, cannot exceed 15. Also, the number of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers must be equal, with the possible exception of the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |title=Constitution of Belgium - Article 99 |publisher=Fed-parl.be |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403214530/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 |archivedate=2010-04-03 }}</ref>\n\nMinisters head executive departments of the government. The Prime Minister and his ministers administer the government and the various [[public services]] and the ministers must defend their policies and performance in person before the Chamber.\n\n====Regional and community governments====\n\nThe regional and community parliaments and governments have jurisdiction over transportation, public works, water policy, cultural matters, education, public health, environment, housing, zoning, and economic and industrial policy. They rely on a system of revenue-sharing for funds. They have the authority to levy a very few taxes (mostly surcharges) and to contract loans. Moreover, they have obtained exclusive treaty-making power for those issues coming under their respective jurisdictions. Of total public spending (interest payments not considered), more than 30% is authorized by the regions and communities, although their financing comes for over 80% from national Belgian budgets; at the same time, the national government controls 100% of social security, and strictly limits the taxation policy by the federalized entities. As a result, Belgian institutions still control over 90% of the effective, global taxation levels on individuals and companies.\n\nThough since 1993 article 35 of the Constitution requires the creation a list specifying federal as opposed to regional and communities' competences, such list was never created. Therefore, the federal government continues to exercise all competences not explicitly dedicated to the lesser levels.<ref>\n{{cite magazine\n|author=Ann Peuteman\n|title=De staatshervorming, war moet dat heen?\n|magazine=Knack magazine\n|date=8 May 2008\n|issue=37th year, number 18\n|page=25\n|quote=In Belgi\u00eb is het voorlopig zo dat bevoegdheden die niet expliciet aan de gewesten of de gemeenschappen zijn toegewezen op federaal niveau worden uitgeoefend. 'In artikel 35 van onze grondwet staat sinds 1993 nochtans dat er een lijst van federale bevoegdheden moet worden gemaakt. Maar dat is nooit gebeurd.', zegt [grondwetspecialist Patrick] Peeters.}}</ref>\n\nThe Flemish parties generally favour much larger community (and regional) autonomy, including financial and tax autonomy, while the francophone parties generally oppose it. The French-speaking parties tend to favour more state control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nAs of October 2019, the regional executives are the following:\n* [[Minister-President of Flanders|Minister-President of Flemish Government (Community+Region)]]: [[Jan Jambon]] (N-VA)\n* [[Minister-President of the French Community|Minister-President of French Community Government]]: [[Pierre-Yves Jeholet]] (MR)\n* [[Minister-President of the Walloon Region|Minister-President of Walloon Regional Government]]: [[Elio Di Rupo]] (PS)\n* [[Minister-President of the Brussels Capital-Region|Minister-President of Brussels-Capital Regional Government]]: [[Rudi Vervoort]] (PS)\n* [[Minister-President of the German-speaking Community|Minister-President of German Community Government]]: [[Oliver Paasch]] (ProDG)\n\n====Provincial and local government====\nThe two biggest regions, Flanders and Wallonia, are further subdivided into five [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] each. The Brussels-Capital Region is directly divided into 19 municipalities. In total, Belgium counts 589 [[municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]]. Provincial and local government is an exclusive competency of the regions. Therefore, one should see the relevant articles for more detailed information on provincial and local government.\n\nIn the Brussels region, there is another form of intermediate government, constituted by institutions from each of the two competent communities. Those institutions ([[COCOF]] for the French-speakers and [[Flemish Community Commission|VGC]] for the [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s) have similar competencies, although only COCOF has legislative powers, given by the French Community. For Brussels community matters common to both communities there is a [[Common Community Commission]].\n\n===Legislative===\n{{Main|Belgian federal parliament}}\nLegislative powers in Belgium are divided between the national, the regional and the community levels.\n\nThe Belgian Federal Parliament consists of the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Senaat''', [[French language|French]]: '''S\u00e9nat''') and the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers''', [[French language|French]]: '''Chambre des Repr\u00e9sentants'''). The Chamber has 150 members; the Senate has 60. All 150 representatives are elected directly via a system of proportional representation. The Senate consists of 50 senators elected by the parliaments of the communities and regions, and 10 senators co-opted by the others.\n\nSince the Constitutional reforms of 1993 and 2013, the two Houses of Parliament do not sit on a level of parity: other than in cases regarding the constitutional, institutional or federal structure or international relation, the consent of the Senate either is not required (so-called \"unicameral laws\", voted only by the House, such as the budget) or can be dispensed of by the House. The Chamber of Representatives is also the only house that votes the confidence to the Government.\n\nEach of the five components of the federal system ([[Flemish Community]], [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]], [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]], [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] and [[Brussels-Capital Region]]) have their own, directly elected [[unicameralism|unicameral]] council or parliament. They vote decrees (or ordinances in Brussels), that have the same value and are on the same juridical level as the federal laws.\n\nThe influence of the main political parties and party leaders is enormous. Many experts{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} estimate that the presidents of the main parties are considerably more powerful than both ordinary ministers and the entire Parliament. For this reason, the Belgian political system is often called a [[particracy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Judiciary===\n{{Main|Judiciary of Belgium}}\nThe judicial system is based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and originates from the [[Napoleonic code]]. It has a judicial review of legislative acts. It accepts compulsory [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] jurisdiction, with reservations. The [[Court of Appeals]] is one level below the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], an institution based on the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Court of Cassation]]. The [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] (Dutch: ''Hof van Cassatie'', French: ''Cour de Cassation'') is the most important court in Belgium. Judges are appointed for life by the Belgian monarch.\n\n==Elections and parties==\n{{Main|Elections in Belgium}}\n\n===Electoral system===\nThe election for the Belgian Chamber of Representatives is based on a system of [[open list]] [[proportional representation]]. Several months before an election, each party forms a list of candidates for each district. Parties are allowed to place as many candidates on their lists as there are seats available. The formation of the list is an internal process that varies with each party. The place on the list is considered to play a role in the election of a candidate, by giving stronger visibility to those high on the list; this phenomenon, however, seems to have lost importance since the last electoral reform.\n\nBelgian voters are given five options. They may:\n* Vote for a list as a whole, thereby showing approval of the order established by the party;\n* Vote for one or more individual candidates, regardless of his/her ranking on the list (a \"preference vote\");\n* Vote for one or more of the \"alternates\" (substitutes);\n* Vote for one or more candidates, and one or more alternates;\n* Vote invalid or blank so no one receives the vote.\n\nWhile there are some options to vote on more than one person, voters cannot vote for candidates of more than one candidate list (party). Doing so makes the vote invalid.\n\nPolitical campaigns in Belgium are relatively short, lasting only about one month. They are subjected to several limitations:\n* There are restrictions on the use of [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]].\n* For all of their activities, campaigns included, the political parties have to rely on government subsidies and dues paid by their members.\n* An electoral expenditures law restricts expenditures during the campaign.\n\nBelgium is one of the few countries that has [[compulsory voting]], thus having one of the highest rates of [[voter turnout]] in the world.<ref>[[Voter turnout|Election turnout]] in national lower house elections from 1960 to 1995, numbers from Mark N. Franklin's \"Electoral Participation.\"</ref>\n\nElections for the Chamber of Representatives (Federal Parliament) are normally held every five years and coincide with those for the [[European Parliament]]. Before 2014, they were held every four years and were held separately.\nThe community and regional parliaments are elected every five years, and their elections coincide with those for the European Parliament as well.\nElections for the members of Belgium's municipal and provincial councils are held every six years.\n\nThe [[2012 Belgian local elections|latest municipal and provincial elections]] were held in 2012 and the latest [[2014 Belgian federal election|federal]] and [[2014 Belgian regional elections|regional elections]] were held in 2014.\n\n===Results from last Chamber election (2014)===\n{{Belgian chamber election, 2014}}\n\n===Political parties===\nIn Belgium, aside from a few minor German-speaking parties, most political parties are either Dutch-speaking (Flemish) or French-speaking; the only major bilingual party operating across all of Belgium is The Workers Party of Party of Belgium (PVDA+/PTB)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://europeelects.eu/european-union/belgium/|title=Belgium|website=Europe Elects|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>, A far-left party who first won seats in the Chamber in 2014 and as of 2019 have 3 seats in Dutch speaking Flanders and 9 seats in Brussels and Wallonia.\n\nAnother important characteristic of Belgian national politics is the highly federal nature of decision making. Important decisions require both a national majority (2/3 for constitutional changes), as well as majorities in the two main language groups. On top of that, both these communities can activate 'alarm bell'-procedures, delaying changes. In addition, there are no national parties to speak of. As a result of this, Belgian decision making can be slow and expensive. On top, it tends to significantly favour the more conservative parties. Given the historically very high public expenditure, and the very strict central control over taxation, even for revenues going to regions and communities, the tendency of Belgian governments to lower taxation and especially labour charges has been limited, at least if compared to radical-liberal approaches followed by certain other countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====History of the political landscape====\nFrom the creation of the Belgian state in 1830 and throughout most of the 19th century, two political parties dominated Belgian politics: the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] (Church-oriented and [[conservatism|conservative]]) and the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] ([[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and [[progressivism|progressive]]). In the late 19th century the [[Belgian Labour Party|Socialist Party]] arose to represent the emerging industrial working class. These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character.\n\nIn the years before and after the Second World War, the linguistic problem became a stronger divisive issue in Belgian politics, with the emergence in the 1950s and 1960s of linguistic parties ([[People's Union (Belgium)|Volksunie]], [[Democratic Front of Francophones|FDF]] and [[Walloon Rally|Rassemblement Wallon]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, each of the main political parties of Belgium split into Flemish and French-speaking parties.\n\nAfter [[Protests of 1968|May 68]], the country saw a growing environmental and left wing movement, that led to the foundation of the ecological parties [[Green!|Groen!]] and [[Ecolo]].\n\nEspecially in Flanders, the 1980s saw the growth of the far right, represented by the [[Vlaams Belang]], which became one of the larger parties of the country in the 1990s.\n\nDuring the years surrounding the new millennium, an attempt at restructuring the political landscape took place, mainly taking the form of political [[Kartel (electoral alliance)|cartels]].\n\n====Main political parties====\n{{Main|Political parties in Belgium|Political parties in Flanders}}\n\nMain Flemish parties:\n* [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&V)\n* [[Groen (political party)|Groen]]\n* [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA)\n* [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open Vld)\n* [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialist Party \u2013 Differently]] (sp.a)\n* [[Vlaams Belang]]\n\nMain French-speaking parties:\n* [[Ecolo]]\n* [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ralistes D\u00e9mocrates Francophones|Francophone Democratic Federalists]] (FDF)\n* [[Centre d\u00e9mocrate humaniste|Humanist Democratic Centre]] (cdH)\n* [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS)\n* [[Mouvement R\u00e9formateur|Reformist Movement]] (MR)\n\nGerman-speaking parties:\n* [[Christlich Soziale Partei (Belgium)|Christian Social Party]] (CSP)\n* [[Partei f\u00fcr Freiheit und Fortschritt|Party for Freedom and Progress]] (PFF)\n* [[ProDG (Belgium)|ProDG]]\n\n===Latest electoral results and government formation===\n{{See also|List of elections in Belgium}}\n* [[2018 Belgian local elections]]\n* [[2019 Belgian regional elections]]\n* [[2019 Belgian federal election]]\n* [[2019 European Parliament election in Belgium]]\n* [[2019 Belgian government formation]]\n\n==Trade unions==\nBelgium is a highly [[trade union|unionised]] country, and organised labour is a powerful influence in politics. About 53% of all private sector and public service employees are labour union members. Not simply a \"bread and butter\" movement in the American sense, Belgian labour unions take positions on education, public finance, defence spending, environmental protection, women's rights, [[abortion]], and other issues. They also provide a range of services, including the administration of unemployment benefits.\n\nBelgium's three principal trade union organizations are the [[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (CSC/ACV) (1,705,000 members), the [[General Federation of Belgian Labour]] (FGTB/ABVV) (1,198,000 members) and the [[General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium]] (CGSLB/ACLVB) which has 230,000 members.\n\nUntil the fifties, the FGTB/ABVV was the largest confederation, since then, however, the CSC/ACV has become the leading trade union force. In the most recent works council elections held in 2004 the CSC/ACV garnered close to 53% of the vote, the Socialist confederation obtained 36%, and the Liberal confederation 10%.\n\nThe Confederation of Catholic labour Unions (CSC/ACV). Organised in 1912, the CSC/ACV rejects the Marxist concept of \"class struggle\" and seeks to achieve a just social order based on Christian principles. The CSC/ACV is not formally linked to its party political counterparts, the Christian Democratic parties (CD&V and CDH), but exercises great influence in their councils.\n\nThe CSC/ACV is the leading union in all Flemish provinces, and in Wallonia's [[Luxembourg (province of Belgium)|Luxembourg province]]. It has almost equal strength with the socialist confederation in the Brussels area. Its President is currently {{ill|Luc Cortebeeck|nl}}.\n\nThe Belgian Socialist Confederation of labour (FGTB/ABVV). The FGTB/ABVV derives from the Socialist Trade Union Movement, established in the late 19th century in Walloon industrial areas, Brussels, and urban areas of Flanders. Today the FGTB/ABVV is the leading union in the [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], [[Namur (province)|Namur]], and [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] provinces and matches the CSC/ACV in Brussels. The FGTB/ABVV is led by President Michel Nollet.\n\n==Linguistic division==\n{{Main|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium | Partition of Belgium}}\n\nBelgium is a country in which language is a major political issue. In the 19th and early 20th century, [[Flemish people|Flemings]] did not enjoy the same rights as French-speakers, both [[de facto]] and [[de jure]]. When the country was founded in 1830 under a census voting system, only around 1% of the adult population could vote: nobility, haute-bourgeoisie and higher clerics, all of them French-speaking. A Flemish movement fought peacefully to gain equal rights, obtaining most of these. Minor issues exist also between German- and French-speakers.\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, Germanic [[Franks]] migrated into what is now Belgium. The less populated northern areas became Germanic, while in the southern part, where the Roman presence had been much stronger, [[Latin]] persisted despite the migrations of the Franks. This linguistic frontier has more or less endured.\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and the 19th century further accentuated the North-South division. Francophone Wallonia became an early industrial boom area, affluent and politically dominant. Dutch-speaking Flanders remained agricultural and was economically and politically outdistanced by Wallonia and the capital. The elite during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century spoke French, even in the Dutch-speaking area. In the 20th century, and particularly after the Second World War, Flanders saw an economic flowering while Wallonia became economically stagnant. As Flemings became more educated and more well off, and sought a fair and equal share of political power, tensions between the two communities rose.\n\nLinguistic demonstrations in the early 1960s led in 1962 to the establishment of a formal linguistic border and elaborate rules were made to protect minorities in linguistically mixed border areas. In 1970, the Constitution was amended. Flemish and francophone cultural councils were established with authority in matters relating to language and culture for the two language groups.\n\nThe 1970 constitutional revision did not finally settle the problem, however. A controversial amendment declared that Belgium consists of three cultural communities (the [[Flemish Community]], the [[French Community of Belgium|French(-speaking) Community]] and the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]]) and three economic regions ([[Flanders]], [[Wallonia]], and [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]]) each to be granted a significant measure of political autonomy. It was not until 1980, however, that an agreement could be reached on how to implement this new constitutional provision.\n\nIn August 1980, the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian Parliament]] passed a devolution bill and amended the [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution]], establishing:\n* A Flemish community legislative assembly (council) and Flemish government;\n* A Francophone community legislative council and government competent for cultural, language, and educational matters; and\n* Walloon and Flemish regional legislative assemblies and governments competent for regional economic matters.\n\nImmediately, the [[Flemish people|Flemings]] had their regional legislative council and government transfer its competencies to the community legislative council and government. That became competent for both cultural, language, and educational affairs, and for regional economic matters.\n\nSince 1984 the [[German-speaking community of Belgium|German language community of Belgium]] (in the eastern part of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]] Province) has had its own legislative assembly and executive, competent for cultural, language, and educational affairs.\n\nIn 1988-89 the [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution]] was again amended to give additional responsibilities to the regions and communities. The most sweeping change was to devolve nearly all responsibilities for educational matters to the communities. Moreover, the regions and communities were provided additional revenue, and Brussels Region was given its own legislative assembly and executive.\n\nAnother important constitutional reform took place in the summer of 1993. It formally changed Belgium from a unitary to a [[federalism|federal]] state. It also (modestly) reformed the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliamentary system and provided for the direct election of the members of the community and regional legislative councils. The bilingual Brabant province was split into separate [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]] provinces, whereas in the Brussels-Capital Region most of the elsewhere provincial powers are exercised by the region and the responsibilities of an elsewhere provincial governor towards the federal level, by the [[Governor of Brussels-Capital]]. However, the electoral and judicial districts of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde were not split.\n\nDespite the numerous constitution revisions, the matter is not completely settled. There is still a lot of political tension between French-speakers and Dutch-speakers, and, to a lesser degree, between French-speakers and the politically far weaker German-speakers.\n\n===Shift from linguistic to cultural and political animosity===\nAt the end of the 20th century, it became clear that the main opposition between [[Flemish people|Fleming]]s and [[Walloons]] was not primarily linguistic anymore, but had shifted to major political and demographic differences. Flemish parties appear much more '[[Anglo-Saxon economy (economic model)|Anglo-Saxon]]' in policy choices, moving away from 'big state' philosophies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} French-speaking parties, including their 'right-wing' parties, tend to favor big government and state support for the poor.\n\nThis became very obvious after the 2007 elections: in [[Flanders]], the classical left-wing parties only captured 1/4 of the votes. On the French-speaking side, the left still carried 1/2 of the votes. One of the key differences centers on the policy towards everyone receiving allocations. Flemings strongly favor a policy focused at helping them regain their autonomy.\n\n==International organization participation==\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\nBelgium is member of [[Agence de Coop\u00e9ration Culturelle et Technique|ACCT]], [[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[Australia Group]], [[Benelux]], [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[CERN]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[European Investment Bank|EIB]], [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]], [[European Space Agency|ESA]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Group of 9|G-9]], [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]], [[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[International Mobile Satellite Organization|Inmarsat]], [[Intelsat]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[NATO]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]], [[Nuclear Suppliers Group|NSG]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]] ([[Observer status|observer]]), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan|UNMOGIP]], [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UNMOP]], [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[West African Development Bank|WADB]] (nonregional), [[World Confederation of Labour|WCL]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[Western European Union|WEU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTrO]] and the [[Zangger Committee]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Belgian order of precedence]]\n* [[2014 Belgian government formation]]\n* [[2010\u201311 Belgian government formation]]\n* [[Belgian Official Journal|Belgian official journal]]\n* [[Corruption in Belgium]]\n* [[List of governments in Belgium]]\n* [[Politics of Flanders]]\n* [[Politics of Wallonia]]\n* [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium]]\n* [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Billiet\n | first = Jaak\n |author2=Bart Maddens |author3=Andr\u00e9-Paul Frognier\n |date= November 2006\n | title = Does Belgium (still) exist?
