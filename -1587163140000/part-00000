Venkateswaran]]. The film stars [[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]] and [[Revathi]], with [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]], [[V. K. Ramasamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]], [[Ra. Sankaran]], Bhaskar, [[Kanchana (actress)|Kanchana]], Vani, Kalaiselvi and [[Sonia (actress)|Sonia]] in supporting roles. It narrates the life of Divya (Revathi), a free-spirited college girl who is forced into an [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged marriage]] with Chandrakumar (Mohan) by her father. Divya, secretly mourning her former lover Manohar (Karthik) who was shot dead, did not want to be married. The story follows Divya's inner conflict between holding onto her past and coming to terms with the present and making a life with Chandrakumar.\n\nThe film's development began when Ratnam began writing a [[short story]] tiled \"Divya\" with no cinematic plans until he finished it. Since production on his directorial debut ''[[Pallavi Anu Pallavi]]'' (1983) was delayed, he took a break for a month and developed \"Divya\" into a film script, which would eventually be renamed ''Mouna Ragam''. Although Ratnam began work on the script during ''Pallavi Anu Pallavi'', it languished in [[development hell]] and ended up becoming his fifth film. ''Mouna Ragam'' was the first film produced by Venkateswaran's Sujatha Films, and was shot primarily in [[Chennai|Madras]], with additional filming taking place in [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]]. The music was composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]], with lyrics by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]]. [[P. C. Sreeram]] was the cinematographer, and the art director was [[Thota Tharani]]. The film was edited by [[B. Lenin]] and [[V. T. Vijayan]].\n\n''Mouna Ragam'' was released on 15 August 1986, [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]]. Despite opening to modest audiences, it became a box-office success, with a theatrical run of over 175 days, and Mani Ratnam's breakthrough. The film received critical acclaim; it won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]], and Ratnam received the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director]]. ''Mouna Ragam'' also became a breakthrough in Karthik's career despite his role being a cameo. The film introduced techniques such as soft-focus shots, flare filters and backlighting, which became popular in Tamil cinema. It was remade in [[Hindi]] in 1992 as ''[[Kasak (1992 film)|Kasak]]'', and in [[Kannada]] in 1999 as ''[[Chandrodaya]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nDivya is a free-spirited college student from a conservative family in [[Chennai|Madras]]. Her father Chandramouli has [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged for her marriage]] and tells Divya to come home early from college to meet Chandrakumar, the groom. Unwilling to get married, and hoping Chandrakumar will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late, only to find him patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, he says that he likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her mother begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar, but they do not consummate their marriage.\n\nChandrakumar takes Divya to his house in [[Delhi]], but she cannot accept him as her husband. When he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, she says she wants a divorce, which shocks Chandrakumar. Some time later, Divya tells Chandrakumar about when he was in love with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang rob a politician's son. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that the politician's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Feeling guilty, Divya bails him out.\n\nManohar falls in love with Divya, and tries to win her love; although she initially rejects him, she eventually returns his feelings. Manohar is a member of a revolutionary group who plan to hold an illegal rally. Divya does not approve, and asks him not to attend; he agrees if she will marry him. On their wedding day, Manohar is falsely accused of participating in the rally and arrested. He escapes, and runs to the marriage registrar's office where Divya is waiting for him. A policeman accidentally shoots Manohar, and he dies in front of Divya.\n\nChandrakumar does not care about Divya's past as he wants to build a future with her. He tells Divya to either sign the divorce papers he has just obtained, or accept the anklets he bought as his wedding gift to her; Divya chooses divorce. They consult a lawyer who tells them that according to the law, since they are newly married they must wait one year to file for divorce. The couple are forced to live together for a year.\n\nHaving told Chandrakumar about her past and the reason why she was unable to accept her marriage, Divya finds herself finally free from her mental baggage and depressed state. She begins to appreciate her situation and make the most of it. Conversely, Chandrakumar is wary of her as he fears what would happen at the end of the year when their divorce would be approved. Troubled, he distances himself from her and rejects her every move. At the same time, he slowly begins falling in love with her while denying his feelings to himself.\n\nChandrakumar is attacked by his company's labourers because he had suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has fallen in love with him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets which are Chandrakumar's wedding gift to her. But before she could do this, Chandrakumar asks her to return to Madras and books her trip, thinking she was simply being immature as she was trying to surprise him by the sound of her feet.\n\nAfter Divya arrives alone at the railway station, she runs into Chandrakumar, who gives her the divorce papers that she had requested, saying they have been approved. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him and would wait indefinitely for him to reciprocate, and tears the divorce papers. A pleasantly surprised Chandrakumar catches up with the train which Divya is in, [[Emergency brake (train)#Passenger-applied brakes|stops it]] and takes Divya home.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n* [[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]] as Chandrakumar<ref name=\"One of a kind\" />\n* [[Revathi]] as Divya<ref name=\"One of a kind\" />\n* [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] as Manohar<ref name=\"One of a kind\" />\n* [[V.

''Divya'' did not explore the girl's past; it only dealt with how she settles into an arranged marriage. Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience, and decided to give them something that would make them accept the character without questioning Divya's actions, then the film could depict the arranged marriage&nbsp;\u2013 two strangers suddenly thrown together&nbsp;\u2013 and how they adjust.

Venkateswaran]]. The film stars [[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]] and [[Revathi]], with [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]], [[V. K. Ramasamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]], [[Ra. Sankaran]], Bhaskar, [[Kanchana (actress)|Kanchana]], Vani, Kalaiselvi and [[Sonia (actress)|Sonia]] in supporting roles. It narrates the life of Divya (Revathi), a free-spirited college girl who is forced into an [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged marriage]] with Chandrakumar (Mohan) by her father. Divya, secretly mourning her former lover Manohar (Karthik) who was shot dead, did not want to be married. The story follows Divya's inner conflict between holding onto her past and coming to terms with the present and making a life with Chandrakumar.\n\nThe film's development began when Ratnam began writing a [[short story]] tiled \"Divya\" with no cinematic plans until he finished it. Since production on his directorial debut ''[[Pallavi Anu Pallavi]]'' (1983) was delayed, he took a break for a month and developed \"Divya\" into a film script, which would eventually be renamed ''Mouna Ragam''. Although Ratnam began work on the script during ''Pallavi Anu Pallavi'', it languished in [[development hell]] and ended up becoming his fifth film. ''Mouna Ragam'' was the first film produced by Venkateswaran's Sujatha Films, and was shot primarily in [[Chennai|Madras]], with additional filming taking place in [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]]. The music was composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]], with lyrics by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]]. [[P. C. Sreeram]] was the cinematographer, and the art director was [[Thota Tharani]]. The film was edited by [[B. Lenin]] and [[V. T. Vijayan]].\n\n''Mouna Ragam'' was released on 15 August 1986, [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]]. Despite opening to modest audiences, it became a box-office success, with a theatrical run of over 175 days, and Mani Ratnam's breakthrough. The film received critical acclaim; it won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]], and Ratnam received the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director]]. ''Mouna Ragam'' also became a breakthrough in Karthik's career despite his role being a cameo. The film introduced techniques such as soft-focus shots, flare filters and backlighting, which became popular in Tamil cinema. It was remade in [[Hindi]] in 1992 as ''[[Kasak (1992 film)|Kasak]]'', and in [[Kannada]] in 1999 as ''[[Chandrodaya]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nDivya is a free-spirited college student from a conservative family in [[Chennai|Madras]]. Her father Chandramouli has [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged for her marriage]] and tells Divya to come home early from college to meet Chandrakumar, the groom. Unwilling to get married, and hoping Chandrakumar will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late, only to find him patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, he says that he likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her mother begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar, but they do not consummate their marriage.\n\nChandrakumar takes Divya to his house in [[Delhi]], but she cannot accept him as her husband. When he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, she says she wants a divorce, which shocks Chandrakumar. Some time later, Divya tells Chandrakumar about when he was in love with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang rob a politician's son. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that the politician's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Feeling guilty, Divya bails him out.\n\nManohar falls in love with Divya, and tries to win her love; although she initially rejects him, she eventually returns his feelings. Manohar is a member of a revolutionary group who plan to hold an illegal rally. Divya does not approve, and asks him not to attend; he agrees if she will marry him. On their wedding day, Manohar is falsely accused of participating in the rally and arrested. He escapes, and runs to the marriage registrar's office where Divya is waiting for him. A policeman accidentally shoots Manohar, and he dies in front of Divya.\n\nChandrakumar does not care about Divya's past as he wants to build a future with her. He tells Divya to either sign the divorce papers he has just obtained, or accept the anklets he bought as his wedding gift to her; Divya chooses divorce. They consult a lawyer who tells them that according to the law, since they are newly married they must wait one year to file for divorce. The couple are forced to live together for a year.\n\nHaving told Chandrakumar about her past and the reason why she was unable to accept her marriage, Divya finds herself finally free from her mental baggage and depressed state. She begins to appreciate her situation and make the most of it. Conversely, Chandrakumar is wary of her as he fears what would happen at the end of the year when their divorce would be approved. Troubled, he distances himself from her and rejects her every move. At the same time, he slowly begins falling in love with her while denying his feelings to himself.\n\nChandrakumar is attacked by his company's labourers because he had suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has fallen in love with him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets which are Chandrakumar's wedding gift to her. But before she could do this, Chandrakumar asks her to return to Madras and books her trip, thinking she was simply being immature as she was trying to surprise him by the sound of her feet.\n\nAfter Divya arrives alone at the railway station, she runs into Chandrakumar, who gives her the divorce papers that she had requested, saying they have been approved. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him and would wait indefinitely for him to reciprocate, and tears the divorce papers. A pleasantly surprised Chandrakumar catches up with the train which Divya is in, [[Emergency brake (train)#Passenger-applied brakes|stops it]] and takes Divya home.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n* [[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]] as Chandrakumar<ref name=\"One of a kind\" />\n* [[Revathi]] as Divya<ref name=\"One of a kind\" />\n* [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] as Manohar<ref name=\"One of a kind\" />\n* [[V.

Ratnam took a break for a month from ''Pallavi Anu Pallavi'' due to its delays, and wrote the script for ''Divya''.{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=38}} For the first time, he was able to write in his native language Tamil, unlike ''Pallavi Anu Pallavi'' where he wrote the script in English and had it translated into Kannada.{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=22}}{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=38}} The new title ''Mouna Ragam'' was derived from the song \"Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam\", from Ratnam's fourth film, ''[[Idaya Kovil]]'' (1985).{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=29}} He considered ''Mouna Ragam'' the second film after ''Pallavi Anu Pallavi'' to be made exactly as he wanted,{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=31}} in contrast to ''Idaya Kovil'' where there was interference.{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|pp=28}}\n\nRatnam initially read the script of ''Mouna Ragam'' when it was titled ''Divya'' to producer N. G. John, but the latter wanted a [[Political cinema|political film]], which eventually became the [[Malayalam]] film ''[[Unaru]]'' (1984), also directed by Ratnam.{{sfn|Rangan|2012|p=22}} He then [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] ''Divya'' to G. Thyagarajan of [[Sathya Jyothi Films]], but Thyagarajan wanted an [[action film]], and Ratnam made ''[[Pagal Nilavu]]'' (1985) with him.{{sfn|Rangan|2012|p=24}} [[Kovaithambi]] of Motherland Pictures too rejected ''Divya'', saying it was not the kind of film Motherland would produce, and Ratnam instead made ''Idaya Kovil'' with them.{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=29}} The film was eventually picked up by Ratnam's brother, [[G. Venkateswaran]], under his Sujatha Films banner,{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=10}} ending its five-year [[development hell]].{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=44}} It was the company's first film production; until then, it was only distributing and financing films.{{Sfn|Rangan|2012|p=10}} ''Mouna Ragam'' was also Ratnam's first collaboration with cinematographer [[P.

He initially had \"someone like [[Anant Nag]] and [[Supriya Pathak]]\" in mind when he finished writing ''Mouna Ragam''.

''Divya'' did not explore the girl's past; it only dealt with how she settles into an arranged marriage. Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience, and decided to give them something that would make them accept the character without questioning Divya's actions, then the film could depict the arranged marriage&nbsp;\u2013 two strangers suddenly thrown together&nbsp;\u2013 and how they adjust.

It is assigned to the [[Eighteenth Air Force]] of [[Air Mobility Command]] and is active duty host wing on McChord. The wing is composed of more than 2,200 active duty military and civilian personnel. It is tasked with supporting worldwide combat and humanitarian airlift contingencies.  Aircraft of the 62nd fly around the world, conducting airdrop training; it also carries out the [[Operation Deep Freeze|Antarctic resupply missions]].\n\n==Units==\n* '''[[62d Operations Group]] (62 OG)'''\n: [[4th Airlift Squadron]] (4 AS)\n: [[7th Airlift Squadron]] (7 AS)\n: [[8th Airlift Squadron]] (8 AS)\n: 62d Operations Support Squadron (62 OSS)\n\n* '''62d Maintenance Group (62 MXG)'''\n* '''627th Air Base Group (627 ABG)''' )\n* '''62d Medical Squadron (62 MDS)'''\n* '''62d Comptroller Squadron (62 CPTS)'''\n\n==History==\n: ''For additional history and lineage, see [[62d Operations Group]]''\n\nThe 62d Airlift Wing was first constituted as the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing on 28 July 1947, at McChord Field, Washington. It owes its numerical designation, and its first seven years of history prior to 1947, to the present day 62d Operations Group.\n\n===Cold War===\nSince the wing was established in 1947 it conducted troop carrier operations, tactical exercises, and humanitarian missions.  The wing trained at McChord Air Force Base, Washington until late 1951 when it moved to Larson Air Force Base.  From Larson the wing routinely performed troop carrier, air transport, and humanitarian missions on a global scale: fling mail to Japan for U.S. troops in Korea in 1952; bringing medical supplies to the flooded areas of Pakistan in 1954; and transporting French troops and equipment from France to [[Indochina]] as part of Operation Bali-Hai from April\u2013May 1954.  The wing airlifted [[radar]] equipment and supplies for the construction of the [[Distant Early Warning Line|Distant Early Warning]] (DEW) Line in northern Alaska and Canada from, 1955\u20131956, and thereafter periodically resupplied DEW stations.  During the [[International Geophysical Year]] 1957-1958, and subsequently through 1962 the wing supported scientific stations in the Arctic Ocean by airlanding and airdropping supplies on the drifting ice.  It helped transport [[United Nations]] troops and supplies to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1960 (\"Operation New Tape\").<ref>Daniel L. Haulman in {{cite book|author=Various|editor=Warnock, A. Timothy|title=Short of War: Major USAF Contingency Operations 1947\u20131997|url=https://archive.org/details/shortofwarmajoru0000unse|accessdate=December 17, 2015|year=2000|publisher=Air University Press|location=Maxwell AFG, AL|isbn=978-0-16-050411-2}}</ref>  In 1963 the wing assumed responsibility for worldwide airlift of [[nuclear weapons]] and associated equipment, continuing this mission through early 1971.  It also assumed airlift of [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] missiles from depots to operating sites in April 1971.  In 1972 it supported [[President of the United States|Presidential]] trips to China and the [[Soviet Union]].  From 12 February to 1 April 1973 the wing transported former [[prisoners of war]] from [[North Vietnam]] to the [[Philippines]] and the United States.  That same year it transported United Nations troops from [[Indonesia]] to [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] as part of a [[peacekeeping]] effort.\n\n[[File:Cargo Aircraft.jpg|thumb|C-124, C-130, and C-141 with [[Mount Saint Helens]] in the background]]\nIn the summer of 1975, the wing assumed control of the [[36th Tactical Airlift Squadron]] (36 TAS) and their C-130E aircraft, which transferred from [[Langley AFB]], Virginia following the transfer of all [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft from [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) to [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC), and the disestablishment of the [[316th Wing|316th Tactical Airlift Wing]] at Langley to make way for the arrival of the [[1st Tactical Fighter Wing]] (1 TFW) and their F-15A and F-15B aircraft. From October 1975 to October 1977, the 62 MAW maintained a detachment of C-130Es in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to support USAF needs in [[Central America|Central]] and South America.  The 62nd airlifted troops and supplies during invasion of [[Grenada]] and airlifted university students to safety from, October\u2013November 1983.  During 1988 62 AW aircraft were used to transport inspectors to the [[Soviet Union]] under terms of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]].  62 AW aircraft were also used that year to transport [[firefighters]] and supplies to [[Wyoming]] to fight major forest fires in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  It participated in the airdrop of heavy equipment and personnel during military action in [[Panama]], 20 December 1989.  During Operation Desert Shield the 62nd airlifted personnel and equipment to [[Southwest Asia]] and operated airlift control elements at [[Zaragoza]], Spain, to direct cargo and personnel destined for Southwest Asia from, August 1990-March 1991. Additionally, during 1991, 62 AW personnel and aircraft facilitated the evacuation of [[Clark Air Base]] and [[Subic Bay Naval Station]] following the eruption of [[Mt. Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nIn addition, some activities of the 62nd Military Airlift Wing did not take place at McChord AFB.  For instance, one unit that belonged to the 62nd MAW\u2014the 602 Military Airlift Support Squadron (MASS) -- was assigned to Elmendorf Air Force Base during the rapid buildup of forces in Vietnam. The 602 MASS supported the flights of C-141 and C-130 aircraft from bases in the continental USA along the great circle route to Japan and Southeast Asia (SEA) by providing refueling services and basic mechanical maintenance for aircraft while en route to and from SEA. The 602 MASS was in operation at Elmendorf around the mid-1960s to about the end of America's involvement in Vietnam.\n\n===End of the Century===\n[[Image:C-141 ODF.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Inspectors of the Joint Southern Control Board reviewing activities of a large, temporarily resident grey metal object]]\nIn 1992, 62 AW flew relief mission to [[Guam]] following [[Typhoon Omar]], Hawaii following [[Hurricane Iniki]], [[Florida]] following [[Hurricane Andrew]], as well as [[Somalia]], the former [[Yugoslavia]], and the former Soviet Union.  In 1993, the 62 AW divested itself of the then-redesignated [[36th Airlift Squadron]] (36 AS), transferring the squadron and its C-130E aircraft to the [[374th Airlift Wing]] (374 AW) at [[Yokota AB]], Japan.  In 1994, the 62 AW dispatched personnel and aircraft to deliver equipment and supplies in support of Operation Support Hope in [[Rwanda]].  During 1995, the 62 AW deployed personnel and aircraft to the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] following [[Hurricane Marilyn]] and to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in support of Operation Joint Endeavor.  62 AW personnel delivered relief supplies to [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam following torrential following spawned by [[1997 Pacific typhoon season|Typhoon Linda]] in 1997.  In 1998, the 62 AW delivered relief supplies to [[Guam]] following Super [[Typhoon Paka]], to [[Papua New Guinea]] following a tsunami, to [[Changsha]], China following severe flooding, and to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] following the bombing of the [[U.S. Embassy]] there.\n\n===Recent activities===\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] the 62 AW has been flying missions in support of the [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]], Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Nobel Eagle, and Operation Infinite Justice.  In 2003 the 62 AW assisted in the troop buildup leading up to Operation Iraqi Freedom and conducted the airdrop of the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] into northern [[Iraq]] at the onset of the [[war]].  In late 2004 and early 2005 the 62 AW was dispatched with emergency relief supplies to areas throughout [[Southeast Asia]] in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]] that struck on 26 December 2004.\n\n===2009 Air Mobility Rodeo===\nIn 2009 the 62 AW won the Best Air Mobility Wing at the [[Air Mobility Rodeo]], a biennial, international airlift competition hosted by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command.  In addition to taking the top prize, the 62 AW also won Best C-17 Team and Best Airdrop Team.

It is assigned to the [[Eighteenth Air Force]] of [[Air Mobility Command]] and is active duty host wing on McChord. The wing is composed of more than 2,200 active duty military and civilian personnel. It is tasked with supporting worldwide combat and humanitarian airlift contingencies.  Aircraft of the 62nd fly around the world, conducting airdrop training; it also carries out the [[Operation Deep Freeze|Antarctic resupply missions]].\n\n==Units==\n* '''[[62d Operations Group]] (62 OG)'''\n: [[4th Airlift Squadron]] (4 AS)\n: [[7th Airlift Squadron]] (7 AS)\n: [[8th Airlift Squadron]] (8 AS)\n: 62d Operations Support Squadron (62 OSS)\n\n* '''62d Maintenance Group (62 MXG)'''\n* '''627th Air Base Group (627 ABG)''' )\n* '''62d Medical Squadron (62 MDS)'''\n* '''62d Comptroller Squadron (62 CPTS)'''\n\n==History==\n: ''For additional history and lineage, see [[62d Operations Group]]''\n\nThe 62d Airlift Wing was first constituted as the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing on 28 July 1947, at McChord Field, Washington. It owes its numerical designation, and its first seven years of history prior to 1947, to the present day 62d Operations Group.\n\n===Cold War===\nSince the wing was established in 1947 it conducted troop carrier operations, tactical exercises, and humanitarian missions.  The wing trained at McChord Air Force Base, Washington until late 1951 when it moved to Larson Air Force Base.  From Larson the wing routinely performed troop carrier, air transport, and humanitarian missions on a global scale: fling mail to Japan for U.S. troops in Korea in 1952; bringing medical supplies to the flooded areas of Pakistan in 1954; and transporting French troops and equipment from France to [[Indochina]] as part of Operation Bali-Hai from April\u2013May 1954.  The wing airlifted [[radar]] equipment and supplies for the construction of the [[Distant Early Warning Line|Distant Early Warning]] (DEW) Line in northern Alaska and Canada from, 1955\u20131956, and thereafter periodically resupplied DEW stations.  During the [[International Geophysical Year]] 1957-1958, and subsequently through 1962 the wing supported scientific stations in the Arctic Ocean by airlanding and airdropping supplies on the drifting ice.  It helped transport [[United Nations]] troops and supplies to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1960 (\"Operation New Tape\").<ref>Daniel L. Haulman in {{cite book|author=Various|editor=Warnock, A. Timothy|title=Short of War: Major USAF Contingency Operations 1947\u20131997|url=https://archive.org/details/shortofwarmajoru0000unse|accessdate=December 17, 2015|year=2000|publisher=Air University Press|location=Maxwell AFG, AL|isbn=978-0-16-050411-2}}</ref>  In 1963 the wing assumed responsibility for worldwide airlift of [[nuclear weapons]] and associated equipment, continuing this mission through early 1971.  It also assumed airlift of [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] missiles from depots to operating sites in April 1971.  In 1972 it supported [[President of the United States|Presidential]] trips to China and the [[Soviet Union]].  From 12 February to 1 April 1973 the wing transported former [[prisoners of war]] from [[North Vietnam]] to the [[Philippines]] and the United States.  That same year it transported United Nations troops from [[Indonesia]] to [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] as part of a [[peacekeeping]] effort.\n\n[[File:Cargo Aircraft.jpg|thumb|C-124, C-130, and C-141 with [[Mount Saint Helens]] in the background]]\nIn the summer of 1975, the wing assumed control of the [[36th Tactical Airlift Squadron]] (36 TAS) and their C-130E aircraft, which transferred from [[Langley AFB]], Virginia following the transfer of all [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft from [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) to [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC), and the disestablishment of the [[316th Wing|316th Tactical Airlift Wing]] at Langley to make way for the arrival of the [[1st Tactical Fighter Wing]] (1 TFW) and their F-15A and F-15B aircraft. From October 1975 to October 1977, the 62 MAW maintained a detachment of C-130Es in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to support USAF needs in [[Central America|Central]] and South America.  The 62nd airlifted troops and supplies during invasion of [[Grenada]] and airlifted university students to safety from, October\u2013November 1983.  During 1988 62 AW aircraft were used to transport inspectors to the [[Soviet Union]] under terms of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]].  62 AW aircraft were also used that year to transport [[firefighters]] and supplies to [[Wyoming]] to fight major forest fires in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  It participated in the airdrop of heavy equipment and personnel during military action in [[Panama]], 20 December 1989.  During Operation Desert Shield the 62nd airlifted personnel and equipment to [[Southwest Asia]] and operated airlift control elements at [[Zaragoza]], Spain, to direct cargo and personnel destined for Southwest Asia from, August 1990-March 1991. Additionally, during 1991, 62 AW personnel and aircraft facilitated the evacuation of [[Clark Air Base]] and [[Subic Bay Naval Station]] following the eruption of [[Mt. Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nIn addition, some activities of the 62nd Military Airlift Wing did not take place at McChord AFB.  For instance, one unit that belonged to the 62nd MAW\u2014the 602 Military Airlift Support Squadron (MASS) -- was assigned to Elmendorf Air Force Base during the rapid buildup of forces in Vietnam. The 602 MASS supported the flights of C-141 and C-130 aircraft from bases in the continental USA along the great circle route to Japan and Southeast Asia (SEA) by providing refueling services and basic mechanical maintenance for aircraft while en route to and from SEA. The 602 MASS was in operation at Elmendorf around the mid-1960s to about the end of America's involvement in Vietnam.\n\n===End of the Century===\n[[Image:C-141 ODF.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Inspectors of the Joint Southern Control Board reviewing activities of a large, temporarily resident grey metal object]]\nIn 1992, 62 AW flew relief mission to [[Guam]] following [[Typhoon Omar]], Hawaii following [[Hurricane Iniki]], [[Florida]] following [[Hurricane Andrew]], as well as [[Somalia]], the former [[Yugoslavia]], and the former Soviet Union.  In 1993, the 62 AW divested itself of the then-redesignated [[36th Airlift Squadron]] (36 AS), transferring the squadron and its C-130E aircraft to the [[374th Airlift Wing]] (374 AW) at [[Yokota AB]], Japan.  In 1994, the 62 AW dispatched personnel and aircraft to deliver equipment and supplies in support of Operation Support Hope in [[Rwanda]].  During 1995, the 62 AW deployed personnel and aircraft to the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] following [[Hurricane Marilyn]] and to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in support of Operation Joint Endeavor.  62 AW personnel delivered relief supplies to [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam following torrential following spawned by [[1997 Pacific typhoon season|Typhoon Linda]] in 1997.  In 1998, the 62 AW delivered relief supplies to [[Guam]] following Super [[Typhoon Paka]], to [[Papua New Guinea]] following a tsunami, to [[Changsha]], China following severe flooding, and to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] following the bombing of the [[U.S. Embassy]] there.\n\n===Recent activities===\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] the 62 AW has been flying missions in support of the [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]], Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Nobel Eagle, and Operation Infinite Justice.  In 2003 the 62 AW assisted in the troop buildup leading up to Operation Iraqi Freedom and conducted the airdrop of the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] into northern [[Iraq]] at the onset of the [[war]].  In late 2004 and early 2005 the 62 AW was dispatched with emergency relief supplies to areas throughout [[Southeast Asia]] in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]] that struck on 26 December 2004.\n\n===2009 Air Mobility Rodeo===\nIn 2009 the 62 AW won the Best Air Mobility Wing at the [[Air Mobility Rodeo]], a biennial, international airlift competition hosted by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command.  In addition to taking the top prize, the 62 AW also won Best C-17 Team and Best Airdrop Team.  Beyond the major awards, sub-category awards won include Best Aerial Port Challenge Course Team, Best Joint Inspection Team, Best C-17 Low-level Airdrop Crew, Best C-17 Aircrew, and Best C-17 Post-flight Team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.amc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/147140/rodeo-2009-winners-announced-for-competitions/|title=RODEO 2009: Winners announced for competitions|date=24 July 2009|access-date=23 February 2017|publisher=RODEO 2009, Public Affairs|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Lineage===\n* Established as '''62nd Troop Carrier Wing''' on 28 July 1947\n: Organized on 15 August 1947\n: Redesignated: '''62nd Troop Carrier Wing, Medium''', on 22 August 1948\n: Redesignated: '''62nd Troop Carrier Wing, Heavy''', on 12 October 1949\n: Inactivated on 1 June 1950\n* Activated on 17 September 1951\n: Redesignated: '''62nd Air Transport Wing, Heavy''', on 1 January 1965\n: Redesignated: '''62nd Military Airlift Wing''' on 8 January 1966\n: Redesignated: '''62d Airlift Wing''' on 1 December 1991.\n* Designated '''62d Air Expeditionary Wing''' in September 2001 when wing elements deployed to combat areas.\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Twelfth Air Force]], 15 August 1947\n* [[Fourth Air Force]], 10 December 1948 \u2013 1 June 1950\n* [[Eighteenth Air Force]], 17 September 1951\n* [[Twenty-Second Air Force]], 1 July 1957\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Fifteenth Air Force]], 1 July 1993\n* [[Eighteenth Air Force]], 1 October 2003\u2013present\n* [[Air Mobility Command]] when wing elements deployed to combat areas any time after 11 September 2001.\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Components===\n'''Wings'''\n* [[302d Troop Carrier Wing]]: attached 27 June 1949 \u2013 5 May 1950\n\n'''Groups'''\n* [[61st Troop Carrier Group]]: attached 21 November 1952 \u2013 24 August 1954\n* [[62nd Operations Group|62nd Troop Carrier (later, 62 Operations) Group]]: 15 August 1947 \u2013 1 June 1950 (detached 2 May-1 June 1950); 1 October 1951-15 January 1960; 1 December 1991\u2013present\n\n'''Squadrons'''\n* [[4th Airlift Squadron|4th Troop Carrier (later, 4 Air Transport; 4 Military Airlift; 4 Airlift) Squadron]]: attached 8\u201314 January 1960, assigned 15 January 1960-1 December 1991\n* [[7th Airlift Squadron|7th Troop Carrier (later, 7 Air Transport; 7 Military Airlift) Squadron]]: attached 8\u201314 January 1960, assigned 15 January 1960-22 December 1969\n* [[8th Airlift Squadron|8th Troop Carrier (later, 8 Air Transport; 8 Military Airlift) Squadron]]: attached 8\u201314 January 1960, assigned 15 January 1960-1 December 1991.\n* [[10th Airlift Squadron]]: 1 October 2003 - 6 December 2016\n* [[19th Military Airlift Squadron|19th Air Transport (later 19th Military Airlift) Squadron]]: 1 July 1963 \u2013 22 December 1969\n* [[28th Military Airlift Squadron|28th Air Transport (later 28th Military Airlift) Squadron]]: 1 July 1963 \u2013 22 December 1969\n* [[36th Airlift Squadron|36th Tactical Airlift (later, 36 Military Airlift) Squadron]]: 1 July 1975 \u2013 1 December 1991.\n<!--*[[602 Military Airlift Support Squadron]].

It was released on February 10, 1998, by [[Merge Records]]. ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' features a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] sound influenced by [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic folk]]. Guitars and drums are paired with less conventional instruments including the [[musical saw|singing saw]], [[zanzithophone]], and [[Uilleann pipes]]. The tempo sometimes abruptly shifts from song to song, while a heavy layer of [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] permeates the music. The lyrics are surrealistic and opaque, with themes ranging from nostalgia to love. Bandleader [[Jeff Mangum]] was influenced by the life of [[Anne Frank]], the teenage diarist who died in a [[Nazi concentration camp]].\n\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was recorded at [[Pet Sounds Studio]], from July to September 1997. Producer [[Robert Schneider]] worked with Mangum to improve upon the lo-fi sound of Neutral Milk Hotel's first album ''[[On Avery Island]]''. As Schneider could not afford standard distortion equipment, he developed a unique recording technique that involved heavy [[Dynamic range compression|compression]]. To promote the album, Neutral Milk Hotel embarked on a tour of the United States and Europe. The band gained a reputation for their chaotic and physically demanding performances, which often scared the audience members.\n\nContemporary reviews were mostly positive. Over the next few years, ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' gained a [[cult following]] through the Internet, and Mangum struggled to cope with his newfound stardom. He grew tired of performing and explaining his lyrics, and disappeared from public eye. ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' went on to receive critical acclaim, and is described by music journalists as a landmark album for indie rock and as one of the best albums of the 1990s.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jeff Mangum at the Atomic Music Hall, Athens, GA, circa 1997 (1296808020).jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a man holding a guitar with a microphone nearby|Jeff Mangum performing with Neutral Milk Hotel on October 28, 1996.]]\nIn the early 1990s, a small contingent of musicians from [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] came together to form the [[The Elephant 6 Recording Company|Elephant 6]] collective, comprising dozens of bands from the area.<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Taylor|url=https://slate.com/culture/2008/02/jeff-mangum-the-salinger-of-indie-rock.html|title=The Salinger of Indie Rock|date=February 26, 2008|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214144048/https://slate.com/culture/2008/02/jeff-mangum-the-salinger-of-indie-rock.html|archivedate=February 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The members included childhood friends [[Jeff Mangum]] and [[Robert Schneider]], who helmed various bands and side-projects.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=12}}\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Mangum had moved from city to city, while Schneider settled down in [[Denver]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=94}} In [[Seattle]], Mangum released a single, \"[[Everything Is (EP)|Everything Is]]\", on [[Cher Doll Records]] under the name Neutral Milk Hotel.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=21}} The single brought enough exposure to convince Mangum to record more material under the Neutral Milk Hotel name. He moved to Denver and worked with Schneider to record the album ''[[On Avery Island]]''.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=22\u201324}} The recording sessions strengthened the musicianship between Mangum and Schneider. While Schneider was interested in a [[Beatlesque]] style of production, he deferred to Mangum's preference for a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] sound. \"At first it was frustrating, but I came to enjoy it. That's how I learned to produce, doing that record, because I totally had to let go of what I thought it should be like.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nAfter the release of ''On Avery Island'', Mangum began looking for bandmates to tour with.{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=98}} While living in Ruston, Mangum befriended New York musician [[Julian Koster]], who had grown tired of interacting with industry executives. The two sent [[demo tape]]s between each other, and eventually Koster joined Neutral Milk Hotel as the bassist.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=26}} During this period, Koster received a letter from Chicago-based drummer [[Jeremy Barnes]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=27}} Barnes wrote how he felt he was being led down a different life than he was supposed to live.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=27}} The letter resonated with Koster and Mangum, and they traveled to Chicago to meet him. After a short audition, the two asked Barnes to drop out of [[DePaul University]] and join the band, to which he agreed.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=27}} The final group member came when Mangum was traveling to New York City to live with Koster. While on a stop in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Mangum met former Rustonian musician [[Scott Spillane]], who was working at a pizza shop. Mangum helped make pizzas during the late-night \"drunk rush\", after which he asked Spillane to join the band. Spillane agreed, and handed in his resignation the following day.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=28}}\n\nOn July 1, 1996, Neutral Milk Hotel began a national tour, and the band members learned to play as a unit.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=30-31}} During the tour, Mangum occasionally played some solo gigs, and debuted ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' tracks including \"Oh Comely\", \"Ghost\", and the then-untitled \"[[Holland, 1945]]\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=31}} The band earned enough money to move to [[Athens, Georgia]], where a large group of Elephant Six musicians were living.{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=99}} By the spring of 1997, Mangum had written and demoed nearly every song on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. He shared these demos with his bandmates before they moved to Denver to record the album.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=42}}\n\n==Recording==\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was produced by Schneider, and was recorded from July to September 1997. It was recorded at [[Pet Sounds Studio]]{{efn|name=\"Studio\"}} in Denver, the home of Schneider's friend [[Jim McIntyre (musician)|Jim McIntyre]].<ref name=\"Liner Notes\"/> Schneider paid half the rent for access to every room in the house except McIntyre's bedroom.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=43}} The recording sessions for ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' coincided with several other sessions. Schneider was already producing ''[[Hooray for Tuesday]]'' for [[the Minders]] when Neutral Milk Hotel members began to arrive, and decided to halt production until ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was finished.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=43-44}} McIntyre was recording the [[Von Hemmling]] song \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" in his bedroom while the band members played, and whenever Koster was not needed, he would work on songs for [[the Music Tapes]], such as \"Television Tells Us\" and \"Aliens\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=44}}\n\nSchneider separated the band members into different rooms, but always kept Mangum close to the control room in case he wanted to plug Mangum's acoustic guitar into a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track cartridge]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} Schneider occasionally tried using an electric guitar, but would wipe these recordings as he felt it did not sound like Mangum's music.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} As the sessions progressed, Schneider wanted to find a way to record the acoustic sound into a microphone instead of into the cartridge. He decided to record the sound through [[Georg Neumann|Neumann U 87]] microphones.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} According to Scheider: \"[Mangum] liked an acoustic plugged in because he kinda found it fuzzy and raw, like an electric guitar, but it had a strummy quality to it, too ... I had developed an acoustic guitar sound on my own that he was really happy with by the second record, and I think it's really good.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}}\n\nNeutral Milk Hotel biographer Kim Cooper believes ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' is one of the most heavily [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] albums ever made, but also notes the lack of equipment such as [[Big Muff]]s or [[Effects unit|distortion pedals]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} Mangum liked having a layer of distortion over the music, but Schneider could not afford standard effects equipment. Instead, Schneider used heavy [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and placed a Bellari RP-220 tube mic [[Preamplifier|pre-amp]] close to his guitar. Schneider then ran the sound through a [[mixing console]], and maxed out the sound on a [[cassette tape]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=45-46}} This process was done for nearly every instrument used on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. Schneider claimed that the nonlinearities of microphone distortion  gave the album its unique \"warm feeling\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=47}}\n\nThe horn arrangements on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' were primarily written by Schneider. He wrote these parts on a piano or organ, then conferred with trombonist Rick Benjamin to ensure the [[musical notation]] was correct.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}} Spillane was the last band member to arrive, so Schneider showed him the arrangements he had already written. The trumpets were written in [[treble clef]], but as Spillane could only read [[bass clef]], he had to rewrite these arrangements before he could learn them.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}} Like he did while learning the songs for ''On Avery Island'', Spillane spent hours every day practicing and writing more arrangements in the basement.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}} Toward the end of the recording sessions, Schneider and Spillane worked together to seamlessly combine their differing arrangements. Schneider's parts were more melancholic while Spillane wrote chaotic and boisterous parts. When asked about the horns on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'', Koster said: \"The tension of Scott being heartfelt, explosive, and Robert trying to superimpose arrangement and control, made for something nice\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Music===\n{{listen\n | position    = right\n | filename    = NeutralMilkHotel-InTheAeroplaneOverTheSea.ogg\n | title       = \"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\"\n | description = The third track of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''.

result, it is difficult to categorize into a specific [[music genre|genre]].<ref name=\"Pitchfork 100\">{{cite

underground\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=8}} Part of the musical variance comes from the instruments used on the album. Traditional instruments like the accordion, drums, and distorted guitars are paired with more unique instruments like the [[musical saw|singing saw]], [[zanzithophone]], and [[Uilleann pipes]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nJeff Mangum's [[strum|guitar strumming]] is a key component for much of the album. Mangum often plays simple chord progressions, which Erik Himmelsbach of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' compared to [[50s progression]].<ref name=\"spin-review\"/> Mangum plays several other instruments on the album, including the organ, [[floor tom]], and [[fuzz bass]]. This is a trend for nearly every musician involved with the album.<ref name=\"Liner Notes\"/> Other important aspects to the music include the heavy amount of distortion, as well as the [[multitrack recording]] method Schneider used for the majority of the instruments.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' emphasizes [[song structure|structure]] and [[texture (music)|texture]], and tracks seamlessly [[segue]] into one another.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> The musical [[tempo]] can greatly shift depending on the track.

Musicians [[John Fernandes]] and Will Westbrook were brought on as touring members, and were taught how to play the horn parts with Spillane. For the tour, Mangum wanted the band to learn how to play the [[Charlie Haden]] track \"Song for Che\", a difficult improvisational jazz piece. Although Mangum was expecting a lot out of the newly expanded band, many outsiders noted how caring and nurturing Mangum was toward everyone involved. Filmmaker [[Lance Bangs]] said: \"He wasn't any kind of a taskmaster\u2014never turning and glaring at anybody\u2014it was never like that. Clearly, there was a love of his circle of friends that made it important for him to build this community and bring them along with him.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=65}}\n\n[[File:ItAotS postcard origins.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The postcard art edited by Chris Bilheimer to create the album cover|alt=An old European postcard. This postcard features three people out at sea. Two people are swimming, while the third person sits atop a box. This postcard was edited to make the album cover.]]\n\nWhile on tour, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a reputation for chaotic and physically demanding concerts. [[Great Lakes (band)|Great Lakes]] member Ben Crum recalled: \"It was definitely dangerous. There often seemed to be a very real chance that someone, probably Julian, would get hurt. Jeff was always doing things like picking him up and throwing him into the drums.\" This caused some audience members to become scared of the band members. Ironically enough, the band members would often ask some audience members if they could spend the night at their house without knowing the homeowner was in fact terrified of them. The [[Audio engineer|audio technicians]] for most venues were confused and did not know what to expect. As a result, Laura Carter took on the unusual role of \"mix-board translator\". According to Carter: \"It was more like talking them through what was about to happen, because so much was happening onstage that without someone helping, it was a wail or squeal and the soundman would look at twenty instruments onstage and not know what to dive for.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=64-66}}\n\n===Artwork===\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''{{'s}} [[album cover|front cover]] features a drawing of two old-fashioned bathers out at sea. One bather is swimming in the water, while the other bather sits atop a box. This bather is wearing a red dress, and has a [[drumhead]] for a face. The back cover features a drawing of marching band members wearing [[stilts]], who are being led by a short [[bandmaster]]. Both illustrations were created by Chris Bilheimer, who at the time was designing artwork for the band [[R.E.M.]] Mangum met Bilheimer while living in Athens, and asked him to create the artwork for Neutral Milk Hotel's upcoming album. Mangum was interested in imagery associated with early 20th century [[Amusement arcade#Penny arcade|penny arcades]], and would often buy postcards from thrift shops that featured this style. One postcard in particular featured three bathers at sea, which Bilheimer cropped and slightly altered to form the album cover.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=60-61}}\n\nIn addition to Bilheimer's drawings, New York [[multimedia]] artist [[Brian Dewan]] created the interior artwork found within physical copies of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. Dewan's most well known piece for the album is a black and white sketch of a flying [[Victrola]] over an industrial plant. Dewan had previously been commissioned by Koster to make the artwork for the Music Tapes [[Demo (music)|demos]]. When Mangum asked Dewan for artwork, he was provided with two sketches: a magic radio, and a flying Victrola, the latter of which was chosen. To give the disparate drawings a cohesive look, Bilheimer scanned every image onto a dirty piece of paper, which made the drawings look the same age, with an effect of slow decay. To add onto this effect, Bilheimer splashed dirt on the album cover just above the female character's outstretched arm.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=60-61}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n{{Album ratings\n| subtitle = Contemporaneous reviews{{clear}}{{small|(published in 1998)}}\n| rev1 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev1Score = B+<ref name=\"EW Review\">{{cite web|last=Brunner|first=Rob|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1998/03/06/aeroplane-over-sea|title=In the Aeroplane Over the Sea|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 6, 1998|accessdate=November 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125121131/http://ew.com/article/1998/03/06/aeroplane-over-sea/|archivedate=November 25, 2017}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev2Score = 6/10<ref name=\"NME Review\">{{cite web|last=Fadele|first=Dele|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101001024reviews.html|title=Neutral Milk Hotel \u2013 In The Aeroplane Over The Sea (Blue Rose)|website=[[NME]]|date=May 23, 1998|accessdate=November 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817191519/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101001024reviews.html|archivedate=August 17, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev3Score = 8.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork 1998\">{{cite web|last=McDermott|first=M.

McDermott wrote that despite the unpredictable sound, the music is \"as catchy as it is frightening\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork 1998\"/> Ben Ratliff of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was more critical of the music. He felt the rhythms and chord changes were boring, while the heavy layer of distortion masked the absence of decent melodies. Ratliff ultimately summarized he review by writing: \"''Aeroplane'' is thin-blooded, woolgathering stuff\".<ref name=\"RS1998\"/>\n\nThe lyrics also drew the attention of most critics. Dele Fadele of ''[[NME]]'' referred to Mangum as a \"sick and demented fellow\", whose evocative songwriting made for a compelling listen.<ref name=\"NME Review\"/> Both Himmelsbach and Ratliff noted the semireligious undertones.<ref name=\"spin-review\"/><ref name=\"RS1998\"/> Himmelsbach described the lyrics as \"darkly comedic and wonderfully wide-eyed\", and commended the [[stream of consciousness]] style of songwriting.<ref name=\"spin-review\"/> McDermott also discussed the dark lyrics, and wrote: \"[Mangum] inherits a world of cannibalism, elastic sexuality and freaks of nature.

The internet has a one-of-a-kind relationship with Neutral Milk Hotel.\"<ref name=\"AV Club\"/>\n\nThis newfound stardom gained through the Internet had a negative effect on Mangum. Tired of touring and having to constantly explain his lyrics, Mangum's mental health began to deteriorate.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> In a 2002 interview, Mangum said: \"a lot of the basic assumptions I held about reality started crumbling\". He would sometimes shut himself inside his home for days on end, and hoarded rice in preparation for the possible [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K problem]].<ref name=\"Slate\"/> Mangum came to the conclusion that he could not continue performing, and instead wanted to disappear from the public eye.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> Mangum was worried about telling the other band members of his decision, and instead simply avoided the topic of new music altogether. This led to the unofficial breakup of Neutral Milk Hotel shortly after the tour. While the band members remained friends, they began to work on other projects. Mangum would occasionally work on music over the next few years, but nothing was widely publicized.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=72-73}}\n\nFans were not told why Mangum disappeared. Some fans were angry, and accused Mangum of being selfish, while other people perpetuated hoaxes surrounding Neutral Milk Hotel's breakup.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> The large vocal response helped ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' gain a [[cult following]], and turned Mangum into an almost mythological character.<ref name=\"AV Club\"/> In 2003 ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'' writer Kevin Griffis dedicated an entire cover story to trying to track down Mangum for personal closure.

It was released on February 10, 1998, by [[Merge Records]]. ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' features a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] sound influenced by [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic folk]]. Guitars and drums are paired with less conventional instruments including the [[musical saw|singing saw]], [[zanzithophone]], and [[Uilleann pipes]]. The tempo sometimes abruptly shifts from song to song, while a heavy layer of [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] permeates the music. The lyrics are surrealistic and opaque, with themes ranging from nostalgia to love. Bandleader [[Jeff Mangum]] was influenced by the life of [[Anne Frank]], the teenage diarist who died in a [[Nazi concentration camp]].\n\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was recorded at [[Pet Sounds Studio]], from July to September 1997. Producer [[Robert Schneider]] worked with Mangum to improve upon the lo-fi sound of Neutral Milk Hotel's first album ''[[On Avery Island]]''. As Schneider could not afford standard distortion equipment, he developed a unique recording technique that involved heavy [[Dynamic range compression|compression]]. To promote the album, Neutral Milk Hotel embarked on a tour of the United States and Europe. The band gained a reputation for their chaotic and physically demanding performances, which often scared the audience members.\n\nContemporary reviews were mostly positive. Over the next few years, ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' gained a [[cult following]] through the Internet, and Mangum struggled to cope with his newfound stardom. He grew tired of performing and explaining his lyrics, and disappeared from public eye. ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' went on to receive critical acclaim, and is described by music journalists as a landmark album for indie rock and as one of the best albums of the 1990s.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Jeff Mangum at the Atomic Music Hall, Athens, GA, circa 1997 (1296808020).jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a man holding a guitar with a microphone nearby|Jeff Mangum performing with Neutral Milk Hotel on October 28, 1996.]]\nIn the early 1990s, a small contingent of musicians from [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] came together to form the [[The Elephant 6 Recording Company|Elephant 6]] collective, comprising dozens of bands from the area.<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Taylor|url=https://slate.com/culture/2008/02/jeff-mangum-the-salinger-of-indie-rock.html|title=The Salinger of Indie Rock|date=February 26, 2008|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214144048/https://slate.com/culture/2008/02/jeff-mangum-the-salinger-of-indie-rock.html|archivedate=February 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The members included childhood friends [[Jeff Mangum]] and [[Robert Schneider]], who helmed various bands and side-projects.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=12}}\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Mangum had moved from city to city, while Schneider settled down in [[Denver]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=94}} In [[Seattle]], Mangum released a single, \"[[Everything Is (EP)|Everything Is]]\", on [[Cher Doll Records]] under the name Neutral Milk Hotel.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=21}} The single brought enough exposure to convince Mangum to record more material under the Neutral Milk Hotel name. He moved to Denver and worked with Schneider to record the album ''[[On Avery Island]]''.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=22\u201324}} The recording sessions strengthened the musicianship between Mangum and Schneider. While Schneider was interested in a [[Beatlesque]] style of production, he deferred to Mangum's preference for a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] sound. \"At first it was frustrating, but I came to enjoy it. That's how I learned to produce, doing that record, because I totally had to let go of what I thought it should be like.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nAfter the release of ''On Avery Island'', Mangum began looking for bandmates to tour with.{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=98}} While living in Ruston, Mangum befriended New York musician [[Julian Koster]], who had grown tired of interacting with industry executives. The two sent [[demo tape]]s between each other, and eventually Koster joined Neutral Milk Hotel as the bassist.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=26}} During this period, Koster received a letter from Chicago-based drummer [[Jeremy Barnes]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=27}} Barnes wrote how he felt he was being led down a different life than he was supposed to live.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=27}} The letter resonated with Koster and Mangum, and they traveled to Chicago to meet him. After a short audition, the two asked Barnes to drop out of [[DePaul University]] and join the band, to which he agreed.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=27}} The final group member came when Mangum was traveling to New York City to live with Koster. While on a stop in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Mangum met former Rustonian musician [[Scott Spillane]], who was working at a pizza shop. Mangum helped make pizzas during the late-night \"drunk rush\", after which he asked Spillane to join the band. Spillane agreed, and handed in his resignation the following day.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=28}}\n\nOn July 1, 1996, Neutral Milk Hotel began a national tour, during which the band members learned to play as a unit.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=30-31}} During the tour, Mangum occasionally played some solo gigs, and debuted ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' tracks including \"Oh Comely\", \"Ghost\", and the then-untitled \"[[Holland, 1945]]\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=31}} The band earned enough money to move to [[Athens, Georgia]], where a large group of Elephant Six musicians were living.{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=99}} By the spring of 1997, Mangum had written and demoed nearly every song on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. He shared these demos with his bandmates before they moved to Denver to record the album.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=42}}\n\n==Recording==\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was produced by Schneider, and was recorded from July to September 1997. It was recorded at [[Pet Sounds Studio]]{{efn|name=\"Studio\"}} in Denver, the home of Schneider's friend [[Jim McIntyre (musician)|Jim McIntyre]].<ref name=\"Liner Notes\"/> Schneider paid half the rent for access to every room in the house except McIntyre's bedroom.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=43}} The recording sessions for ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' coincided with several other sessions. Schneider was already producing ''[[Hooray for Tuesday]]'' for [[the Minders]] when Neutral Milk Hotel members began to arrive, and decided to halt production until ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' was finished.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=43-44}} McIntyre was recording the [[Von Hemmling]] song \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" in his bedroom while the band members played, and whenever Koster was not needed, he would work on songs for [[the Music Tapes]], such as \"Television Tells Us\" and \"Aliens\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=44}}\n\nSchneider separated the band members into different rooms, but always kept Mangum close to the control room in case he wanted to plug Mangum's acoustic guitar into a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track cartridge]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} Schneider occasionally tried using an electric guitar, but would wipe these recordings as he felt it did not sound like Mangum's music.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} As the sessions progressed, Schneider wanted to find a way to record the acoustic sound into a microphone instead of into the cartridge. He decided to record the sound through [[Georg Neumann|Neumann U 87]] microphones.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} According to Scheider: \"[Mangum] liked an acoustic plugged in because he kinda found it fuzzy and raw, like an electric guitar, but it had a strummy quality to it, too ... I had developed an acoustic guitar sound on my own that he was really happy with by the second record, and I think it's really good.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}}\n\nNeutral Milk Hotel biographer Kim Cooper believes ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' is one of the most heavily [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] albums ever made, but also notes the lack of equipment such as [[Big Muff]]s or [[Effects unit|distortion pedals]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=45}} Mangum liked having a layer of distortion over the music, but Schneider could not afford standard effects equipment. Instead, Schneider used heavy [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and placed a Bellari RP-220 tube mic [[Preamplifier|pre-amp]] close to his guitar. Schneider then ran the sound through a [[mixing console]], and maxed out the sound on a [[cassette tape]].{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=45-46}} This process was done for nearly every instrument used on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. Schneider claimed that the nonlinearities of microphone distortion  gave the album its unique \"warm feeling\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=47}}\n\nThe horn arrangements on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' were primarily written by Schneider. He wrote these parts on a piano or organ, then conferred with trombonist Rick Benjamin to ensure the [[musical notation]] was correct.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}} Spillane was the last band member to arrive, so Schneider showed him the arrangements he had already written. The trumpets were written in [[treble clef]], but as Spillane could only read [[bass clef]], he had to rewrite these arrangements before he could learn them.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}} Like he did while learning the songs for ''On Avery Island'', Spillane spent hours every day practicing and writing more arrangements in the basement.{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}} Toward the end of the recording sessions, Schneider and Spillane worked together to seamlessly combine their differing arrangements. Schneider's parts were more melancholic while Spillane wrote chaotic and boisterous parts. When asked about the horns on ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'', Koster said: \"The tension of Scott being heartfelt, explosive, and Robert trying to superimpose arrangement and control, made for something nice\".{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=50}}\n\n==Composition==\n===Music===\n{{listen\n | position    = right\n | filename    = NeutralMilkHotel-InTheAeroplaneOverTheSea.ogg\n | title       = \"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\"\n | description = The third track of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''.

It puts ultimate faith in raw feelings, the kind that consume you without logic or sense\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork Summary\"/>\n\nLove is another prominent lyrical theme, although the concept of love takes on different forms.<ref name=\"PopMatters\"/> PJ Sauerteig of ''[[PopMatters]]'' believes ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''{{'s}} central message is Mangum's longing desire to be loved by the people he idolizes, whether that be a love interest or with his fellow peers.<ref name=\"PopMatters\"/> The lyrics will sometimes describe how Mangum wants to physically merge with the things he loves, which symbolizes a need for interconnectedness with loved ones. Sauerteig cites the track \"Two-Headed Boy\" as an example of this concept. The track describes [[conjoined twins]], although Sauerteig believes the conjoined twins are a metaphor for two people who unsuccessfully merged with each other, and now feel like they are trapped in an interdependent relationship.<ref name=\"PopMatters\">{{cite web|last=Sauerteig|first=PJ|url=https://www.popmatters.com/194640-what-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea-is-really-about-2495516849.html|title=What Neutral Milk Hotel's 'In the Aeroplane Over the Sea' Is Really About|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200412194854/https://www.popmatters.com/194640-what-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea-is-really-about-2495516849.html|archivedate=April 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there is little concrete information as to the genesis of some of the lyrics, Mangum has stated a major influence was [[Anne Frank]], a teenage girl who died in a [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]].

Musicians [[John Fernandes]] and Will Westbrook were brought on as touring members, and were taught how to play the horn parts with Spillane. For the tour, Mangum wanted the band to learn how to play the [[Charlie Haden]] track \"Song for Che\", a difficult improvisational jazz piece. Although Mangum was expecting a lot out of the newly expanded band, many outsiders noted how caring and nurturing Mangum was toward everyone involved. Filmmaker [[Lance Bangs]] said: \"He wasn't any kind of a taskmaster\u2014never turning and glaring at anybody\u2014it was never like that. Clearly, there was a love of his circle of friends that made it important for him to build this community and bring them along with him.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|p=65}}\n\n[[File:ItAotS postcard origins.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The postcard art edited by Chris Bilheimer to create the album cover|alt=An old European postcard. This postcard features three people out at sea. Two people are swimming, while the third person sits atop a box. This postcard was edited to make the album cover.]]\n\nWhile on tour, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a reputation for chaotic and physically demanding concerts. [[Great Lakes (band)|Great Lakes]] member Ben Crum recalled: \"It was definitely dangerous. There often seemed to be a very real chance that someone, probably Julian, would get hurt. Jeff was always doing things like picking him up and throwing him into the drums.\" This caused some audience members to become scared of the band members. Ironically enough, the band members would often ask some audience members if they could spend the night at their house without knowing the homeowner was in fact terrified of them. The [[Audio engineer|audio technicians]] for most venues were confused and did not know what to expect. As a result, Laura Carter took on the unusual role of \"mix-board translator\". According to Carter: \"It was more like talking them through what was about to happen, because so much was happening onstage that without someone helping, it was a wail or squeal and the soundman would look at twenty instruments onstage and not know what to dive for.\"{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=64-66}}\n\n===Artwork===\n''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''{{'s}} [[album cover|front cover]] features a drawing of two old-fashioned bathers out at sea. One bather is swimming in the water, while the other bather sits atop a box. This bather is wearing a red dress, and has a [[drumhead]] for a face. The back cover features a drawing of marching band members wearing [[stilts]], who are being led by a short [[bandmaster]]. Both illustrations were created by Chris Bilheimer, who at the time was designing artwork for the band [[R.E.M.]] Mangum met Bilheimer while living in Athens, and asked him to create the artwork for Neutral Milk Hotel's upcoming album. Mangum was interested in imagery associated with early 20th century [[Amusement arcade#Penny arcade|penny arcades]], and would often buy postcards from thrift shops that featured this style. One postcard in particular featured three bathers at sea, which Bilheimer cropped and slightly altered to form the album cover.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=60-61}}\n\nIn addition to Bilheimer's drawings, New York [[multimedia]] artist [[Brian Dewan]] created the interior artwork found within physical copies of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea''. Dewan's most well known piece for the album is a black and white sketch of a flying [[Victrola]] over an industrial plant. Dewan had previously been commissioned by Koster to make the artwork for the Music Tapes [[Demo (music)|demos]]. When Mangum asked Dewan for artwork, he was provided with two sketches: a magic radio, and a flying Victrola, the latter of which was chosen. To give the disparate drawings a cohesive look, Bilheimer scanned every image onto a dirty piece of paper, which made the drawings look the same age, with an effect of slow decay. To add onto this effect, Bilheimer splashed dirt on the album cover just above the female character's outstretched arm.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=60-61}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n{{Album ratings\n| subtitle = Contemporaneous reviews{{clear}}{{small|(published in 1998)}}\n| rev1 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev1Score = B+<ref name=\"EW Review\">{{cite web|last=Brunner|first=Rob|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1998/03/06/aeroplane-over-sea|title=In the Aeroplane Over the Sea|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 6, 1998|accessdate=November 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125121131/http://ew.com/article/1998/03/06/aeroplane-over-sea/|archivedate=November 25, 2017}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev2Score = 6/10<ref name=\"NME Review\">{{cite web|last=Fadele|first=Dele|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101001024reviews.html|title=Neutral Milk Hotel \u2013 In The Aeroplane Over The Sea (Blue Rose)|website=[[NME]]|date=May 23, 1998|accessdate=November 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817191519/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101001024reviews.html|archivedate=August 17, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev3Score = 8.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork 1998\">{{cite web|last=McDermott|first=M.

Winkie wrote: \"Would ''Aeroplane'' occupy the same untouchable place in American indie-rock culture if it was released in 1992? Or 1987? It's hard to say. The internet has a one-of-a-kind relationship with Neutral Milk Hotel.\"<ref name=\"AV Club\"/>\n\nThis newfound stardom gained through the Internet had a negative effect on Mangum. Tired of touring and having to constantly explain his lyrics, Mangum's mental health began to deteriorate.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> In a 2002 interview, Mangum said: \"a lot of the basic assumptions I held about reality started crumbling\". He would sometimes shut himself inside his home for days on end, and hoarded rice in preparation for the possible [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K problem]].<ref name=\"Slate\"/> Mangum came to the conclusion that he could not continue performing, and instead wanted to disappear from the public eye.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> Mangum was worried about telling the other band members of his decision, and instead simply avoided the topic of new music altogether. This led to the unofficial breakup of Neutral Milk Hotel shortly after the tour. While the band members remained friends, they began to work on other projects. Mangum would occasionally work on music over the next few years, but nothing was widely publicized.{{sf|Cooper|2005|pp=72-73}}\n\nFans were not told why Mangum disappeared. Some fans were angry, and accused Mangum of being selfish, while other people perpetuated hoaxes surrounding Neutral Milk Hotel's breakup.<ref name=\"Slate\"/> The large vocal response helped ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' gain a [[cult following]], and turned Mangum into an almost mythological character.<ref name=\"AV Club\"/> In 2003 ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'' writer Kevin Griffis dedicated an entire cover story to trying to track down Mangum for personal closure. The search ended when Mangum sent him an email that read: \"I'm not an idea. I am a person, who obviously wants to be left alone.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Ballance|1a2=Cook|1a3=McCaughan|1y=2009|1p=104}} Journalist Mark Richardson attempted to explain the album's rise in popularity: \"Because [Mangum] was inaccessible, there was no outlet for connection other than the record itself and other fans who shared a passion.

Richardson said Mangum could be seen as a \"privileged dude sharing naive stoner wisdom\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork Summary\"/> ''[[Grantland]]'' writer Steven Hyden also noted how his adoration for ''In

Samantha was a bright, creative, and loving little girl. She encouraged her friends and siblings to try their best and \u201cBe Brave.\u201d Samantha\u2019s greatest gift was \ufb01nding and sharing the joy in all that she did.\n\nErin Runnion is the mother of Samantha Runnion and the Founding Director of The Joyful Child Foundation. Erin is dedicated to ensuring that Samantha\u2019s tragic death will continue to be a catalyst to engage adults in our collective responsibility to protect our nation\u2019s children. Honors include A Certificate of Valor from The Department of Justice, People Magazine\u2019s 2004 Heroes Among Us Award, and commendations from the California State Assembly.\n\nWe've been fighting to protect children for nearly 18 years and we will not stop. What's important to know is that children are the number one victims of all violent crime of any single demographic in this country. On a scale of the severity of these crimes, what happened to Samantha was extreme. Much more common, sadly, is the fact that the majority of harm done to children is at the hands of someone the child (and the family) knows or trusts when the child is alone. The Joyful Child Foundation's Be Brave - Be Safe Programs give children and families the skills and training to help our young people identify, avoid, and resist violence and abuse. If we don't teach our children to trust their instincts and that it's not okay for anyone to hurt them, predators can advantage of their innocence.
