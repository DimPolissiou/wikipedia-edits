It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.<ref name=\"hogg2002\">Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|Short-stroke gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies.\n\nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own. Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian 7.62mm FN FAL instead as the L1 ''Self-Loading Rifle'' (SLR).\n* '''FAL .280 Experimental Automatic Carbine, Short Model (1951)''': A [[Bullpup|bullpup-frame]] version of the FAL chambered in .280 British designed to compete with the British EM-1 and EM-2 bullpup rifles.

It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958.

The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade. For night assaults on prepared defensive positions, Israeli infantry often crept to within rifle grenade range.

As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

During the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973 it was still in front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]]. The lead soldiers carry Belgian-made 7.62 mm FN FAL (X8E1).{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=15}}]]\nIn the more than 60 years of use worldwide, the FAL has seen use in conflicts all over the world. During the [[Falklands War]], the FN FAL was used by both sides. The FAL was used by the Argentine armed forces and the L1A1 Self Loading Rifle (SLR), a semi-automatic only version of the FAL, was used by the armed forces of the UK and other Commonwealth nations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Ten Combat Rifles|url=http://military.discovery.com/tv-shows/combat-countdown/top-10-combat-rifles.htm|publisher=Military Channel|accessdate=12 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127212217/http://military.discovery.com/tv-shows/combat-countdown/top-10-combat-rifles.htm|archive-date=27 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Mau Mau Uprising]]:<ref name=\"Encyclopedie\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Contre les Mau Mau|language=fr |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die des armes : Les forces arm\u00e9es du monde|publisher=Atlas|year=1986|pages=2764\u20132766|volume=XII|number=139.

After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|Short-stroke gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies.\n\nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own. Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian 7.62mm FN FAL instead as the L1 ''Self-Loading Rifle'' (SLR).\n* '''FAL .280 Experimental Automatic Carbine, Short Model (1951)''': A [[Bullpup|bullpup-frame]] version of the FAL chambered in .280 British designed to compete with the British EM-1 and EM-2 bullpup rifles.

The first 20,000 were manufactured by ''Fabrique Nationale d\u2019Armes de Guerre''-Herstal Belgique, but later the StG58 was manufactured under licence by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] (now [[Steyr Mannlicher]]), and was formerly the standard rifle of the [[Austrian Armed Forces|''\u00d6sterreichisches Bundesheer'']] (Austrian Federal Army). It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade. For night assaults on prepared defensive positions, Israeli infantry often crept to within rifle grenade range. The assault was started with a volley of grenades onto the enemy positions intended to stun them and put their heads down, immediately followed by the infantry assault before their opponents could recover... As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

During the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973 it was still in front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan).

The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].

Patiala is located around the ''[[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]'' (the 'Fortunate Castle') constructed by the [[Sidhu]] [[Jat]] chieftain [[Ala Singh]], who founded the royal dynasty of [[Patiala State]] in 1763, and after whom the city is named.\n\nIn popular culture, the city remains famous for its traditional ''[[Patiala Shahi Pagg|Patiala shahi]]'' [[turban]] (a type of headgear), ''paranda'' (a tasselled tag for braiding hair), ''Patiala salwar'' (a type of female trousers), ''[[jutti]]'' (a type of footwear) and [[Patiala peg]] (a measure of liquor).<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://patiala.nic.in/html/history.htm#introduction|title=History of Patiala|publisher=Official Website of District Patiala|accessdate=19 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907045829/http://patiala.nic.in/html/history.htm#introduction|archivedate=7 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n'Patiala' comes from the roots ''pati'' and ''ala'', the former is [[Urdu]] for a \"strip of land\" and ''<nowiki/>'ala''<nowiki/>' comes from the name of the founder of the city, Ala Singh.

After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] were defeated by the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless power struggle with the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] of [[Lahore]].\n\nIn 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the [[British Raj|British]] against [[Sikh]] ruler [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire building process by the British in, the sub-continent of India. Patiala became a [[17-guns salute]] state during the [[British Raj]]. The rulers of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], [[Rajinder Singh]], [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yadavindra Singh|Yadvindra Singh]] were treated with respect and dignity by the British.\n\n[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|left|The Darshani Gate (the main gate of the [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]), built in the 18th century. The city was built around the fort.]]\nThe city of Patiala was designed and developed according to a plan akin to that of [[Hindu temple architecture|temple architecture]], the first settlers of Patiala were the [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] of Sirhind, who opened their business establishments outside the Darshani Gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patiala.gov.in/html/history.htm|title=History Of Patiala|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe royal house is now headed by [[Amarinder Singh|Captain Amarinder Singh]] who is also the current [[Chief Minister of Punjab (India)|Chief Minister of Punjab]]. The royals are considered cultural and political icons in east Punjab.\n\nMaharaja Karam Singh who ruled from 1813 to 1845 (the Sikh Kingdom of Patiala in Punjab) joined the British East India Company and helped the British during the First Anglo Sikh wars against the Sikh Empire of Maharajah Ranjit Singh of Punjab which was larger and extended from Tibet Kashmir, plains of Punjab to Peshawar near the Afghan borders.\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\n===Kali Devi Mandir===\n[[File:Shri Kali Devi Patiala.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Murti]]'' of Maa kali at the [[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala]]. The temple was commissioned by the Sikh ruler of Patiala, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] in 1936.]]\n[[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala|Kali Devi Temple]] is a [[Hindu temple]] dedicated to [[Maa Kaali]]. The temple was built by the Sikh ruler of the Patiala State, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]], who financed the building of the temple in his capital and oversaw its installation in 1936. Legend has it that the Maharaja built the temple to protect the city from flooding and performed annual sacrifice at the temple. Bhupinder Singh ruled the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938. He brought the 6-ft statue of Divine Mother Kali and Paawan Jyoti from Bengal to Patiala and offered the first [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Bali]] (sacrifice) of a water buffalo to the temple. Because of the temple's beautiful structure, it has been declared a national monument. This large complex attracts devotees, [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]], from distant places.\n\nA much older temple of Raj Rajeshwari is also situated in the centre of this complex. The temple is situated opposite the Baradari garden at Mall Road. Devotees offer mustard oil, daal (lentils), sweets, coconuts, bangles and chunnis, goats, hens and [[liquor]] to the Divine Mother here. As an average estimate, devotees offer more than 60,000 liquor bottles during Navratras alone, which distributed to the beggars sitting outside the temple, and goes into a 'Sharab Kund' built on the temple's premises.<ref>http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/donate-online/religious-offering-inner/1323430251</ref>\n\n=== Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib ===\n[[File:Dukh Nivaran 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib]], Patiala]]\nAccording to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the Gurdwara, one Bhag Ram, a Jhivar of Lehal, waited upon ninth Guru of Sikhs [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh). He requested that the Guru might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its inhabitants could be rid of a severe and mysterious sickness which had been their bane for a long time.\n\nThe [[Sikh gurus|Guru]] visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a [[Banyan|banyan tree]] by the side of a pond. The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as [[Gurdwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib|Dukh Nivaran]], literally meaning eradicator of suffering. Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the Sarovar attached to the shrine. It is still believed that any illness can be cured by 'ishnaan' on five consecutive [[Panchami]]. It is in the vicinity of Patiala Bus Station.\n\n=== Gurdwara Moti Bagh ===\nGurudwara Moti Baag is situated in the outerskirts of the Patiala City. When Shri Guru Teg Bahadur started his journey towards [[Delhi]], he came here via [[Kiratpur Sahib]], Bharatgarh Sahib, Roap Makar, Kabulpur etc. Saint Saif Ali Khan was a great follower of Guru, To fulfil his wish Guru Sahib came to his Place Saifabad (Bahadur Garh). The holly Guru stayed here for 3 Months. Saif Ali Khan Served the Guru with great devotion. In daytime Guru Teg Bahadur used to meditate on the Place inside the Qila (Fort) and at the night time, he would come here. From here the Guru left for [[Samana, Punjab|Samana]] and stayed in the Haveli of Muhamad Bakhshish. From there onward, Guru Sahib left towards Cheeka Via Karhali, Balbera.\n\n=== Bahadurgarh Fort ===\nThe Bahadurgarh Fort is 6 kilometres away from Patiala city.

Outside the Qila are the Darshani Gate, a Shiva temple, and bazaar shops which border the streets that run around the Qila and sell precious ornaments, colourful hand-woven fabrics, '[[Jooti|jootis]]' and bright 'Parandis'.\n\nIt was the principal residence of the Patiala royals until the construction of Old Moti Bagh Palace.\n\nThe entrance is through an imposing gate. The architectural style of the palace is a synthesis of late Mughal and Rajasthani. The complex has ten courtyards along the north-south axis. Each courtyard is unique in size and character, some being broad, others very small and others mere slits in the fabric of the building. Though the Androon is a single interconnected building, it is spoken of as a series of palaces. Each set of rooms makes a cluster around a courtyard, and each carries a name: Topkhana, Qila Mubarak, Sheesh Mahal, Treasury and Prison. Ten of the rooms are painted with frescoes or decorated intricately with mirror and gilt.\n\nIn a tiny portion of the complex is a little British construction with Gothic arches, fireplaces made of marble and built-in toilets perched on the Mughal Rajasthani roof. Burj Baba Ala Singh has a fire smouldering ever since the time of Ala Singh, along with a flame brought by him from Jwalaji. Every year it's decorated beautifully for the Heritage Festival.\n\n=== Sheesh Mahal ===\n[[File:Suspension Bridge at Sheesh Mahal, Patiala.jpg|thumb|The suspension bridge at Sheesh Mahal, Patiala]]\nA part of the Old Moti Bagh Palace built in the 19th century by the Maharajas is the famous Sheesh Mahal, literally meaning the Palace of Mirrors.

After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] were defeated by the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless power struggle with the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] of [[Lahore]].\n\nIn 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the [[British Raj|British]] against [[Sikh]] ruler [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire building process by the British in, the sub-continent of India. Patiala became a [[17-guns salute]] state during the [[British Raj]]. The rulers of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], [[Rajinder Singh]], [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yadavindra Singh|Yadvindra Singh]] were treated with respect and dignity by the British.\n\n[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|left|The Darshani Gate (the main gate of the [[Qila Mubarak, Patiala|Qila Mubarak]]), built in the 18th century.

The royals are considered cultural and political icons in east Punjab.\n\nMaharaja Karam Singh who ruled from 1813 to 1845 (the Sikh Kingdom of Patiala in Punjab) joined the British East India Company and helped the British during the First Anglo Sikh wars against the Sikh Empire of Maharajah Ranjit Singh of Punjab which was larger and extended from Tibet Kashmir, plains of Punjab to Peshawar near the Afghan borders.\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n\n===Kali Devi Mandir===\n[[File:Shri Kali Devi Patiala.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Murti]]'' of Maa kali at the [[Shri Kali Devi Temple, Patiala]].

Legend has it that the Maharaja built the temple to protect the city from flooding and performed annual sacrifice at the temple. Bhupinder Singh ruled the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938. He brought the 6-ft statue of Divine Mother Kali and Paawan Jyoti from Bengal to Patiala and offered the first [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Bali]] (sacrifice) of a water buffalo to the temple.

This large complex attracts devotees, [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]], from distant places.\n\nA much older temple of Raj Rajeshwari is also situated in the centre of this complex. The temple is situated opposite the Baradari garden at Mall Road. Devotees offer mustard oil, daal (lentils), sweets, coconuts, bangles and chunnis, goats, hens and [[liquor]] to the Divine Mother here.

Each courtyard is unique in size and character, some being broad, others very small and others mere slits in the fabric of the building. Though the Androon is a single interconnected building, it is spoken of as a series of palaces. Each set of rooms makes a cluster around a courtyard, and each carries a name: Topkhana, Qila Mubarak, Sheesh Mahal, Treasury and Prison. Ten of the rooms are painted with frescoes or decorated intricately with mirror and gilt.\n\nIn a tiny portion of the complex is a little British construction with Gothic arches, fireplaces made of marble and built-in toilets perched on the Mughal Rajasthani roof.
