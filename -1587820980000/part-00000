[[Rabindranath Tagore]] gave Amartya Sen his name (Bengali \u0985\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09af ''\u00f4morto'', lit. \"immortal\"). Sen's family was from Wari and [[Manikganj District|Manikganj]], [[Dhaka]], both in present-day [[Bangladesh]]. His father Ashutosh Sen was Professor of Chemistry at [[Dhaka University]], Development Commissioner in Delhi and then Chairman of the West Bengal Public Service Commission. He moved with his family to [[West Bengal]] in 1945. Sen's mother Amita Sen was the daughter of [[Kshitimohan Sen|Kshiti Mohan Sen]], the eminent Sanskritist and scholar of ancient and medieval India, who was a close associate of Rabindranath Tagore. K.M. Sen served as the second [[Vice Chancellor]] of [[Visva-Bharati University|Visva Bharati University]] from 1953\u20131954.\n\nSen began his high-school education at [[St Gregory's School (Dhaka)|St Gregory's School]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1940. In the fall of 1941, Sen was admitted to [[Patha Bhavana]], Shantiniketan, where he completed his school education, in which he excelled, obtaining the highest ranks in his school board and I.A. examinations in the whole of Bengal. The school had many progressive features, such as distaste for examinations or competitive testing. In addition, the school stressed cultural diversity, and embraced cultural influences from the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen - Biographical |publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> In 1951, he went to [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], where he earned a B.A. in Economics with First in the First Class, with a minor in Mathematics, as a graduating student of the [[University of Calcutta]]. While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15% chance of living five years.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Riz Khan interviewing Amartya Sen |date=21 August 2010 |title=One on One - Amartya Sen |medium=Television production |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN5esbvAt-w |access-date=2016-04-26 |time=18:40 minutes in |publisher=Al Jazeera }}</ref> With radiation treatment, he survived, and in 1953 he moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he earned a second B.A. in Economics in 1955 with a First Class, topping the list as well. At this time, he was elected President of the Cambridge Majlis. While Sen was officially a Ph.D student at Cambridge (though he had finished his research in 1955\u201356), he was offered the position of First-Professor and First-Head of the Economics Department of the newly created [[Jadavpur University]] in [[Calcutta]]. He is still the youngest chairman to have headed the Department of Economics. He served in that position, starting the new Economics Department, from 1956 to 1958.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, which gave him four years of freedom to do anything he liked; he made the radical decision to study [[philosophy]]. Sen explained: \"The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, [[social choice theory]] makes intense use of [[mathematical logic]] and also draws on [[moral philosophy]], and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own.\"<ref name=Philosophy>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen \u2013 Biographical: Philosophy and economics |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> His interest in philosophy, however, dates back to his college days at Presidency, where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes.

Because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both Trinity and Cambridge, Sen chose a different subject for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis, which was on \"[[Choice of techniques|The Choice of Techniques]]\" in 1959. The work had been completed earlier, except for advice from his adjunct supervisor in India, Professor [[A.K. Dasgupta]], given to Sen while teaching and revising his work at Jadavpur, under the supervision of the \"brilliant but vigorously intolerant\" [[post-Keynesian]], [[Joan Robinson]].<ref name=Robinson>{{cite web|title= Amartya Sen \u2013 Biographical: Cambridge as a battleground |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Quentin Skinner]] notes that Sen was a member of the secret society [[Cambridge Apostles]] during his time at Cambridge.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Professor Quentin Skinner and Alan Macfarlane | title = Interview of Professor Quentin Skinner &nbsp;\u2013 part 2 | medium = Video | via = YouTube | location = Cambridge | date = 2 June 2008 | minutes = 57:55 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVdAhzqFLps }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1960\u201361, Amartya Sen visited the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], on leave from Trinity College.\n\n==Research work==\nSen's work on 'Choice of Techniques' complemented that of Maurice Dobb. In a developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation. In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive.\nSen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of [[social choice]], which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist [[Kenneth Arrow]].  Arrow, while working at the [[RAND Corporation]], had most famously shown that\nwhen voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), any [[Ranked voting system|ranked order]] [[voting system]] will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms. Sen's contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Benicourt | first = Emmanuelle | title = Is Amartya Sen a post-autistic economist? | journal = Post-Autistic Economics Review | issue = 15 | pages = article 4 | date = 1 September 2002 | url = http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue15/Benicourt15.htm | accessdate= 16 June 2014}}</ref> applied, as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice, informed by his interests in [[history of economic thought]] and philosophy.\n[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|Official Portrait at the Nobel Prize]]\nIn 1981, Sen published ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised food prices, thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up.<ref name=Time>{{cite news | last= Sachs | first= Jeffrey | author-link = Jeffrey Sachs | title= The real causes of famine: a Nobel laureate blames authoritarian rulers | url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989405,00.html | accessdate= 16 June 2014 | work= Time | date= 26 October 1998 }}</ref>\n\nSen's interest in famine stemmed from personal experience. As a nine-year-old boy, he witnessed the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which three million people perished. This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded. He presents data that there was an adequate food supply in Bengal at the time, but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like barbers did not have the means to buy food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include British military acquisition, [[panic buying]], hoarding, and [[price gouging]], all connected to the war in the region. In ''Poverty and Famines'', Sen revealed that in many cases of famine, food supplies were not significantly reduced. In Bengal, for example, food production, while down on the previous year, was higher than in previous non-famine years. Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution, which led to starvation. His [[capability approach|capabilities approach]] focuses on [[positive liberty|positive freedom]], a person's actual ability to be or do something, rather than on [[negative liberty|negative freedom]] approaches, which are common in economics and simply focuses on non-interference. In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected. However, they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything, they did not have the functioning of nourishment, nor the capability to escape morbidity.\n\nIn addition to his important work on the causes of famines, Sen's work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the \"[[Human Development Report]]\",<ref name=UNDP>{{cite book | contribution = Overview &#124; Celebrating 20 years of human development | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme | title = Human Development Report 2010 &#124; 20th anniversary edition &#124; the real wealth of nations: pathways to human development | page = 2 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780230284456 | quote = ...the first HDR called for a different approach to economics and development \u2013 one that put people at the centre.

This is because top-down development will always trump [[human rights]] as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a \"right\" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a right to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have \"functionings\". These \"functionings\" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the [[Polling station|polls]]. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the \"capabilities approach\" in practice, see [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ''Women and Human Development''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Women and human development: the capabilities approach | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521003858 }}</ref>\n\nHe wrote a controversial article in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing\" (see [[Missing women of Asia]]), analyzing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia. Other studies, including one by [[Emily Oster]], had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Oster | first1 = Emily |last2 = Chen | first2 = Gang | author-link1 = Emily Oster |title=Hepatitis B does not explain male-biased sex ratios in China |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=107 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=142\u2013144 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.01.007 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w13971.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book ''[[Development as Freedom]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Development as Freedom|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Anchor|year=1998|isbn=978-0385720274|location=|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentasfre00amar}}</ref> Sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim daily labourer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age.\n\nIn ''Development as Freedom'', Sen outlines five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms  refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development. He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well. In this regard he discusses the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well-educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations etc. A comparison is also drawn between China and India to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms. Both countries were working towards developing their economies, China since 1979 and India since 1991.\n\nWelfare economics seeks to evaluate economic policies in terms of their effects on the well-being of the community. Sen, who devoted his career to such issues, was called the \"conscience of his profession\". His influential monograph ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'' (1970), which addressed problems related to individual rights (including formulation of the [[liberal paradox]]), justice and equity, majority rule, and the availability of information about individual conditions, inspired researchers to turn their attention to issues of basic welfare. Sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor. For instance, his theoretical work on inequality provided an explanation for why there are fewer women than men in India<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Sen | first = Amartya | title = Many Faces of Gender Inequality | journal = Frontline | volume = 18 | issue = 22 | date = 27 October \u2013 9 November 2001 | url = http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220040.htm | ref = harv }}</ref> and in China despite the fact that in the West and in poor but medically unbiased countries, women have lower [[mortality rate]]s at all ages, live longer, and make a slight majority of the population. Sen claimed that this skewed ratio results from the better health treatment and childhood opportunities afforded boys in those countries, as well as [[sex-selective abortion]]s.\n\nGovernments and international organisations handling food crises were influenced by Sen's work. His views encouraged policy makers to pay attention not only to alleviating immediate suffering but also to finding ways to replace the lost income of the poor\u2014for example through public works\u2014and to maintain stable prices for food. A vigorous defender of political freedom, Sen believed that famines do not occur in functioning democracies because their leaders must be more responsive to the demands of the citizens. In order for economic growth to be achieved, he argued, social reforms\u2014such as improvements in education and public health\u2014must precede economic reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Amartya-Sen|title=Amartya Sen {{!}} Indian economist|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sen published a book called ''[[The Idea of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"Sen 2010\" /> Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, Sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of [[John Rawls]] or [[John Harsanyi]]. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] or [[David Hume]], and inspired by the philosophical works of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realisations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being equally important. As an alternative to Rawls's [[veil of ignorance]], Sen chose the [[thought experiment]] of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of [[John Stuart Mill]]) and a focus on people's capabilities (an [[capability approach|approach]] that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice.\n\n==Career==\nSen began his career both as a teacher and a research scholar in the Department of Economics, [[Jadavpur University]] as a Professor of Economics in 1956. He spent two years in that position. From 1957 to 1963, Sen served as a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Between 1960 and 1961, Sen was a visiting Professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the United States, where he got to know [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Solow]], [[Franco Modigliani]], and [[Norbert Wiener]].<ref name=Calcutta>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen &#124; Biographical: opening paragraph |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=12 June 2012 }}</ref> He was also a visiting Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1964-1965) and [[Cornell University|Cornell]] University (1978-1984).

He was a companion of distinguished economists like [[Manmohan Singh]] (Ex-Prime Minister of India and a veteran economist responsible for liberalizing the Indian economy), [[K. N.

This is a period considered to be a Golden Period in the history of DSE. In 1971, he joined the [[London School of Economics]] as a Professor of Economics where he taught until 1977.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] gave Amartya Sen his name (Bengali \u0985\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09af ''\u00f4morto'', lit. \"immortal\"). Sen's family was from Wari and [[Manikganj District|Manikganj]], [[Dhaka]], both in present-day [[Bangladesh]]. His father Ashutosh Sen was Professor of Chemistry at [[Dhaka University]], Development Commissioner in Delhi and then Chairman of the West Bengal Public Service Commission. He moved with his family to [[West Bengal]] in 1945. Sen's mother Amita Sen was the daughter of [[Kshitimohan Sen|Kshiti Mohan Sen]], the eminent Sanskritist and scholar of ancient and medieval India, who was a close associate of Rabindranath Tagore. K.M. Sen served as the second [[Vice Chancellor]] of [[Visva-Bharati University|Visva Bharati University]] from 1953-1954.\n\nSen began his high-school education at [[St Gregory's School (Dhaka)|St Gregory's School]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1940. In the fall of 1941, Sen was admitted to [[Patha Bhavana]], Shantiniketan, where he completed his school education, in which he excelled, obtaining the highest ranks in his school board and I.A. examinations in the whole of Bengal. The school had many progressive features, such as distaste for examinations or competitive testing. In addition, the school stressed cultural diversity, and embraced cultural influences from the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen - Biographical |publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> In 1951, he went to [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], where he earned a B.A. in Economics with First in the First Class, with a minor in Mathematics, as a graduating student of the [[University of Calcutta]]. While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15% chance of living five years.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Riz Khan interviewing Amartya Sen |date=21 August 2010 |title=One on One - Amartya Sen |medium=Television production |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN5esbvAt-w |access-date=2016-04-26 |time=18:40 minutes in |publisher=Al Jazeera }}</ref> With radiation treatment, he survived, and in 1953 he moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he earned a second B.A. in Economics in 1955 with a First Class, topping the list as well. At this time, he was elected President of the Cambridge Majlis. While Sen was officially a Ph.D student at Cambridge (though he had finished his research in 1955\u201356), he was offered the position of First-Professor and First-Head of the Economics Department of the newly created [[Jadavpur University]] in [[Calcutta]]. He is still the youngest chairman to have headed the Department of Economics. He served in that position, starting the new Economics Department, from 1956 to 1958.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, which gave him four years of freedom to do anything he liked; he made the radical decision to study [[philosophy]]. Sen explained: \"The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, [[social choice theory]] makes intense use of [[mathematical logic]] and also draws on [[moral philosophy]], and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own.\"<ref name=Philosophy>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen \u2013 Biographical: Philosophy and economics |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> His interest in philosophy, however, dates back to his college days at Presidency, where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes.

Because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both Trinity and Cambridge, Sen chose a different subject for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis, which was on \"[[Choice of techniques|The Choice of Techniques]]\" in 1959. The work had been completed earlier, except for advice from his adjunct supervisor in India, Professor [[A.K. Dasgupta]], given to Sen while teaching and revising his work at Jadavpur, under the supervision of the \"brilliant but vigorously intolerant\" [[post-Keynesian]], [[Joan Robinson]].<ref name=Robinson>{{cite web|title= Amartya Sen \u2013 Biographical: Cambridge as a battleground |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Quentin Skinner]] notes that Sen was a member of the secret society [[Cambridge Apostles]] during his time at Cambridge.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Professor Quentin Skinner and Alan Macfarlane | title = Interview of Professor Quentin Skinner &nbsp;\u2013 part 2 | medium = Video | via = YouTube | location = Cambridge | date = 2 June 2008 | minutes = 57:55 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVdAhzqFLps }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1960\u201361, Amartya Sen visited the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], on leave from Trinity College.\n\n==Research work==\nSen's work on 'Choice of Techniques' complemented that of Maurice Dobb. In a developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation. In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive.\nSen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of [[social choice]], which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist [[Kenneth Arrow]].  Arrow, while working at the [[RAND Corporation]], had most famously shown that\nwhen voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), any [[Ranked voting system|ranked order]] [[voting system]] will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms. Sen's contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Benicourt | first = Emmanuelle | title = Is Amartya Sen a post-autistic economist? | journal = Post-Autistic Economics Review | issue = 15 | pages = article 4 | date = 1 September 2002 | url = http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue15/Benicourt15.htm | accessdate= 16 June 2014}}</ref> applied, as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice, informed by his interests in [[history of economic thought]] and philosophy.\n[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|Official Portrait at the Nobel Prize]]\nIn 1981, Sen published ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised food prices, thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up.<ref name=Time>{{cite news | last= Sachs | first= Jeffrey | author-link = Jeffrey Sachs | title= The real causes of famine: a Nobel laureate blames authoritarian rulers | url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989405,00.html | accessdate= 16 June 2014 | work= Time | date= 26 October 1998 }}</ref>\n\nSen's interest in famine stemmed from personal experience. As a nine-year-old boy, he witnessed the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which three million people perished. This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded. He presents data that there was an adequate food supply in Bengal at the time, but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like barbers did not have the means to buy food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include British military acquisition, [[panic buying]], hoarding, and [[price gouging]], all connected to the war in the region. In ''Poverty and Famines'', Sen revealed that in many cases of famine, food supplies were not significantly reduced. In Bengal, for example, food production, while down on the previous year, was higher than in previous non-famine years. Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution, which led to starvation. His [[capability approach|capabilities approach]] focuses on [[positive liberty|positive freedom]], a person's actual ability to be or do something, rather than on [[negative liberty|negative freedom]] approaches, which are common in economics and simply focuses on non-interference. In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected. However, they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything, they did not have the functioning of nourishment, nor the capability to escape morbidity.\n\nIn addition to his important work on the causes of famines, Sen's work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the \"[[Human Development Report]]\",<ref name=UNDP>{{cite book | contribution = Overview &#124; Celebrating 20 years of human development | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme | title = Human Development Report 2010 &#124; 20th anniversary edition &#124; the real wealth of nations: pathways to human development | page = 2 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780230284456 | quote = ...the first HDR called for a different approach to economics and development \u2013 one that put people at the centre.

This is because top-down development will always trump [[human rights]] as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a \"right\" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a right to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have \"functionings\". These \"functionings\" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the [[Polling station|polls]]. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the \"capabilities approach\" in practice, see [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ''Women and Human Development''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Women and human development: the capabilities approach | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521003858 }}</ref>\n\nHe wrote a controversial article in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing\" (see [[Missing women of Asia]]), analyzing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia. Other studies, including one by [[Emily Oster]], had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Oster | first1 = Emily |last2 = Chen | first2 = Gang | author-link1 = Emily Oster |title=Hepatitis B does not explain male-biased sex ratios in China |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=107 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=142\u2013144 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.01.007 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w13971.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book ''[[Development as Freedom]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Development as Freedom|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Anchor|year=1998|isbn=978-0385720274|location=|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentasfre00amar}}</ref> Sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim daily labourer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighbourhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighbourhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. Kader Mia need not have come to a hostile area in search of income in those troubled times if his family could have managed without it. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age.\n\nIn ''Development as Freedom'', Sen outlines five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms  refer to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development. He elaborates upon this by illustrating the closely interconnected natures of the five main freedoms as he believes that expansion of one of those freedoms can lead to expansion in another one as well. In this regard he discusses the correlation between social opportunities of education and health and how both of these complement economic and political freedoms as a healthy and well-educated person is better suited to make informed economic decisions and be involved in fruitful political demonstrations etc. A comparison is also drawn between China and India to illustrate this interdependence of freedoms. Both countries were working towards developing their economies, China since 1979 and India since 1991.\n\nWelfare economics seeks to evaluate economic policies in terms of their effects on the well-being of the community. Sen, who devoted his career to such issues, was called the \"conscience of his profession\". His influential monograph ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'' (1970), which addressed problems related to individual rights (including formulation of the [[liberal paradox]]), justice and equity, majority rule, and the availability of information about individual conditions, inspired researchers to turn their attention to issues of basic welfare. Sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor. For instance, his theoretical work on inequality provided an explanation for why there are fewer women than men in India<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Sen | first = Amartya | title = Many Faces of Gender Inequality | journal = Frontline | volume = 18 | issue = 22 | date = 27 October \u2013 9 November 2001 | url = http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220040.htm | ref = harv }}</ref> and in China despite the fact that in the West and in poor but medically unbiased countries, women have lower [[mortality rate]]s at all ages, live longer, and make a slight majority of the population. Sen claimed that this skewed ratio results from the better health treatment and childhood opportunities afforded boys in those countries, as well as [[sex-selective abortion]]s.\n\nGovernments and international organisations handling food crises were influenced by Sen's work. His views encouraged policy makers to pay attention not only to alleviating immediate suffering but also to finding ways to replace the lost income of the poor\u2014for example through public works\u2014and to maintain stable prices for food. A vigorous defender of political freedom, Sen believed that famines do not occur in functioning democracies because their leaders must be more responsive to the demands of the citizens. In order for economic growth to be achieved, he argued, social reforms\u2014such as improvements in education and public health\u2014must precede economic reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Amartya-Sen|title=Amartya Sen {{!}} Indian economist|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sen published a book called ''[[The Idea of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"Sen 2010\" /> Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, Sen presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of [[John Rawls]] or [[John Harsanyi]]. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] or [[David Hume]], and inspired by the philosophical works of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realisations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being equally important. As an alternative to Rawls's [[veil of ignorance]], Sen chose the [[thought experiment]] of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of [[John Stuart Mill]]) and a focus on people's capabilities (an [[capability approach|approach]] that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice.\n\n==Career==\nSen began his career both as a teacher and a research scholar in the Department of Economics, [[Jadavpur University]] as a Professor of Economics in 1956. He spent two years in that position. From 1957 to 1963, Sen served as a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Between 1960 and 1961, Sen was a visiting Professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the United States, where he got to know [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Solow]], [[Franco Modigliani]], and [[Norbert Wiener]].<ref name=Calcutta>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen &#124; Biographical: opening paragraph |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=12 June 2012 }}</ref> He was also a visiting Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1964-1965) and [[Cornell University|Cornell]] University (1978-1984).

It had been conducting classes both in English and Japanese, and welcoming students from abroad from [[China]], [[Korea]], and even from [[Europe]]. Soon afterward, Sophia gained national repute as the leading institution in globalisation, foreign languages, and literature in Japan. As a prominent institution for research and [[Higher education|higher learning]] in the fields of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, the University has been selected by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] to be one of 37 universities to receive funding for its internationalisation efforts through the \"[[Top Global University Project]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tgu.mext.go.jp/en/|title=Top Global University Project Japan|website=Top Global University Project Japan|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> .\n\nToday, Sophia has international students from 77 countries. It also has forged agreements with 298 overseas universities in 59 countries. It also possesses student exchange programs with several other top universities throughout the world, including [[Georgetown University]], [[Yale University]], [[The University of Georgia]], [[Sogang University]], [[University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong University]], and [[University of Cologne|the University of Cologne]]. Before 1957, the university only admitted male students to degree programs, but the numbers of male and female students are now more or less equal. Sophia\u2019s alumni are referred to as \"Sophians\"; they include the 79th Prime Minister of Japan, [[Morihiro Hosokawa]], several politicians represented in the [[National Diet|National Diet of Japan]], and professors at various institutions.\n\n== Origins of the University Name ==\nThe name of the University is traced to letters of correspondence between two of the three founders of what would become Sophia University, Fr. James Rockliff, SJ and Fr. Hermann Hoffmann, SJ. The Japanese term \u4e0a\u667a (\"higher wisdom\" or \"supreme wisdom\", ''J\u014dchi'') was the equivalent of the Latin word ''sapientia,'' which means wisdom. According to Catholic Church tradition, the term ''sapientia'' refers to the one of the Church's devotional titles for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary]], the [[Seat of Wisdom]]. \n\nWhen Joseph Eylenbosch, SJ began teaching [[Greek language|Greek]] at the University on April 1924, he taught that the Japanese term ''j\u014dchi'' was the equivalent of the Greek term \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (''sofia''). Afterwords, the students had proposed that the school be known as Sophia University. \n\nFr. Hoffmann, SJ, who was serving as University President at that time, initially opposed the proposal. However, he soon accepted the idea and submitted the proposal to Rome for the approval. \n\nThe [[English language|English]] language-based, peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] ''[[Monumenta Nipponica]]'', which was first inaugurated in 1938, identified itself as being published by Sophia University. The use of Sophia as the University name then became firmly established in Japan and overseas <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/u9gsah00000007pn-att/websophiaE41.pdf|title=Origins of the school name; the school emblem and school flag; the school colors and school song,  No. 41|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>. \n\n== History of the University ==\n\n=== Early History ===\nThe origins of Sophia University could be traced to 1549 when [[Francis Xavier|Saint Francis Xavier]], a  prominent member and co-founder of the Society of Jesus, arrived in Japan to spread Christianity. In his letters to his fellow Jesuits, he had expressed hopes of establishing a university in Japan <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/history/history_1.html|title=Arrival of St. Francis Xavier--1967|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/features/c02303/saint-francis-xavier-and-the-roots-of-christianity-in-japan.html|title=Saint Francis Xavier and the Roots of Christianity in Japan|date=27 August 2015|website=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon Communications Foundation|publication-place=Minato, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\nDuring the so-called [[Kirishitan]] period of Japanese history, the Catholic Church had been responsible for establishing and administering educational institutions in Japan called ''Collegios'' and ''Seminarios'', serving as bridges between the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. \n[[File:William H O'Connell PNAC.JPG|thumb|William H. O'Connell had been appointed as a special ambassador of the Vatican to Japan.]]\nThe establishment of the University only began to take place more than 400 years from St. Francis Xavier's arrival in Japan. In 1903, three Jesuit priests from Europe came to Japan to continue the missionary work of the Church and to help establish Sophia University. One of the founders, Fr. Joseph Dahlmann, SJ from [[Germany]], who had come to Japan via [[India]], had listened to the requests of Catholics in the country, who expressed their desires to construct a Catholic university to serve as the cultural and spiritual base of the Church's missionary operations in Japan. \n\nFr. Dahlmann heeded the requests and sent a proposal to the then-[[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], [[Pope Pius X]], at the [[Holy See]] in Rome. \n\nDahlmann was then granted a private audience with the Pope in 1905 regarding the request. The Pius X promised to assign  the Society of Jesus to create and administer a Catholic university in Japan. In Dahlmann's [[Latin-language|Latin]] [[Memoir|memoirs]] regarding the encounter with the His Holiness, he recounted that the Pope spoke as follows: \"''Habebitis collegium in Japonica, magnam universitatem'' (in English: \"You (plural) will have in Japan a college that is a great university\".). \n\nOn that same year, the then-Bishop of [[Portland, Maine]] in the [[United States]], [[William Henry O'Connell|William H. O'Connell]], was appointed by the Pope to serve as a special ambassador of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to [[Emperor Meiji]] in Japan. O'Connell was also tasked to survey the situation in Japan. When he was granted an audience with Emperor Meiji, he had ascertained the education policy directions of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Education Ministry]], and reported to officials at the Holy See regarding the possible establishment of a Catholic university in Japan. \n\nAt the 25th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus in held in Rome on September 1906, Pius X issued a formal written statement to the Jesuits to establish a Catholic university in Japan. Thus, the delegates at the Congregation voted unanimously in favour of the Pope's commands, and the first concrete steps were taken to prepare a university institution in the East <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/spirit/spirit_02.html|title=The Society of Jesus and the founding of Sophia University|last=Luhmer, SJ|first=Klaus|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== History of the University After Its Establishment ===\n[[File:Sophia University,1914.jpg|thumb|An academic building at Sophia University, a year after its establishment.]]\n[[File:Sophia University,1945.jpg|thumb|Sophia University in 1945.]]\nSophia University was founded by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s in 1913. It opened with departments of German Literature, Philosophy and Commerce, headed by its founder Fr. Hermann Hoffmann, SJ (1864\u20131937) as its first official president.<ref>{{cite web| title =Hoffman | url =http://www.con-spiration.de/syre/english/jun/e0601.html }}</ref>\n\nIn 1932, a small group of Sophia University students refused to salute the war dead at [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in the presence of a [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese military]] attache, saying it violated their [[Faith in Christianity|religious beliefs]]. The military attache was withdrawn from Sophia as a result of this incident, damaging the university's reputation in the eyes of the government of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] <!-- 'damaging in whose eyes? -->. The Archbishop of Tokyo intervened in the standoff by permitting Catholic students to salute the war dead, after which many Sophia students, as well as Hermann Hoffmann himself, participated in rites at Yasukuni. The [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] later issued the ''Pluries Instanterque'' in 1936, which encouraged [[Catholicism|Catholics]] to attend [[Shinto shrine]]s as a [[patriotism|patriotic]] gesture; the Vatican re-issued this document after the war in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Breen|first=John|title=Popes, Bishops and War Criminals: reflections on Catholics and Yasukuni in post-war Japan|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|date=1 March 2010|url= http://www.japanfocus.org/-John-Breen/3312|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nSophia University continued to grow by increasing the numbers of departments, faculty members and students, in addition to advancing its international focus by establishing an exchange program. Many of its students studied at [[Georgetown University]] in the United States as early as 1935. Sophia's junior college was established in 1973, followed by the opening of Sophia Community College in 1976. With the founding of the Faculty of Liberal Arts in 2006, Sophia University presently holds 27 departments in its eight faculties. Its current president is Yoshiaki Terumichi. Toshiaki Koso serves as head of its board of directors. Since 2008, the Global Leadership Program was started for students from four [[Jesuit]] universities in [[East Asia]]: [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] in [[Taiwan]], [[Sogang University]] in [[South Korea]], and Sophia University in Japan.<ref>[http://hompi.sogang.ac.kr/2009glp/2009glp_f_1_1.html Profile], hompi.sogang.ac.kr; accessed 22 September 2014.</ref> In 2016 the University reached out to the four Jesuit junior-senior high schools in Japan, joining them in the Sophia College Corporation to help them pass on the Jesuit charism to their lay faculty through workshops and other assistance.

Founded by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Religious order (Catholic)|religious order]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1913, the University has grown from its 3 original [[Academic department|academic departments]] of [[Philosophy]], [[German literature|German Literature]], and [[Commerce]] to 9 undergraduate Faculties and 10 Graduate Schools, with over 13,900 students in total<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/overview/u9gsah0000000am6-att/Statistics2018p3GraduateStudents.pdf|title=Sophia University Graduate Students \u300c\u4e0a\u667a\u5927\u5b66\u5927\u5b66\u9662\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u300d|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan.|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/overview/u9gsah0000000am6-att/Statistics2018p2UndergraduateStudents.pdf|title=Sophia University Undergraduate Students\u300c\u4e0a\u667a\u5927\u5b66\u5b66\u90e8\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u300d|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/history/history_1.html|title=History of Sophia University: Arrival of St. Francis Xavier-1967|last=|first=|date=|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\nEver since Sophia was established in 1913, the University has been a leader in the internationalization of Japanese universities. It had been conducting classes both in English and Japanese, and welcoming students from abroad from [[China]], [[Korea]], and even from [[Europe]]. Soon afterward, Sophia gained national repute as the leading institution in globalization, foreign languages, and literature in Japan. As a prominent institution for research and [[Higher education|higher learning]] in the fields of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, the University has been selected by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] to be one of 37 universities to receive funding for its internationalization efforts through the \"[[Top Global University Project]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tgu.mext.go.jp/en/|title=Top Global University Project Japan|website=Top Global University Project Japan|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> .\n\nToday, Sophia has international students from 77 countries. It also has forged agreements with 298 overseas universities in 59 countries. It also possesses student exchange programs with several other top universities throughout the world, including [[Georgetown University]], [[Yale University]], [[The University of Georgia]], [[Sogang University]], [[University of Hong Kong|Hong Kong University]], and [[University of Cologne|the University of Cologne]]. Before 1957, the university only admitted male students to degree programs, but the numbers of male and female students are now more or less equal. Sophia\u2019s alumni are referred to as \"Sophians\"; they include the 79th Prime Minister of Japan, [[Morihiro Hosokawa]], several politicians represented in the [[National Diet|National Diet of Japan]], and professors at various institutions.\n\n== Origins of the University Name ==\nThe name of the University is traced to letters of correspondence between two of the three founders of what would become Sophia University, Fr. James Rockliff, SJ and Fr. Hermann Hoffmann, SJ. The Japanese term \u4e0a\u667a (\"higher wisdom\" or \"supreme wisdom\", ''J\u014dchi'') was the equivalent of the Latin word ''sapientia,'' which means wisdom. According to Catholic Church tradition, the term ''sapientia'' refers to the one of the Church's devotional titles for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary]], the [[Seat of Wisdom]]. \n\nWhen Joseph Eylenbosch, SJ began teaching [[Greek language|Greek]] at the University on April 1924, he taught that the Japanese term ''j\u014dchi'' was the equivalent of the Greek term \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (''sofia''). Afterwords, the students had proposed that the school be known as Sophia University. \n\nFr. Hoffmann, SJ, who was serving as University President at that time, initially opposed the proposal. However, he soon accepted the idea and submitted the proposal to Rome for the approval. \n\nThe [[English language|English]] language-based, peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] ''[[Monumenta Nipponica]]'', which was first inaugurated in 1938, identified itself as being published by Sophia University. The use of Sophia as the University name then became firmly established in Japan and overseas <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/u9gsah00000007pn-att/websophiaE41.pdf|title=Origins of the school name; the school emblem and school flag; the school colors and school song,  No. 41|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>. \n\n== History of the University ==\n\n=== Early History ===\nThe origins of Sophia University could be traced to 1549 when [[Francis Xavier|Saint Francis Xavier]], a  prominent member and co-founder of the Society of Jesus, arrived in Japan to spread Christianity. In his letters to his fellow Jesuits, he had expressed hopes of establishing a university in Japan <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/history/history_1.html|title=Arrival of St. Francis Xavier--1967|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/features/c02303/saint-francis-xavier-and-the-roots-of-christianity-in-japan.html|title=Saint Francis Xavier and the Roots of Christianity in Japan|date=27 August 2015|website=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon Communications Foundation|publication-place=Minato, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\nDuring the so-called [[Kirishitan]] period of Japanese history, the Catholic Church had been responsible for establishing and administering educational institutions in Japan called ''Collegios'' and ''Seminarios'', serving as bridges between the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. \n[[File:William H O'Connell PNAC.JPG|thumb|William H. O'Connell had been appointed as a special ambassador of the Vatican to Japan.]]\nThe establishment of the University only began to take place more than 400 years from St. Francis Xavier's arrival in Japan. In 1903, three Jesuit priests from Europe came to Japan to continue the missionary work of the Church and to help establish Sophia University. One of the founders, Fr. Joseph Dahlmann, SJ from [[Germany]], who had come to Japan via [[India]], had listened to the requests of Catholics in the country, who expressed their desires to construct a Catholic university to serve as the cultural and spiritual base of the Church's missionary operations in Japan. \n\nFr. Dahlmann heeded the requests and sent a proposal to the then-[[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], [[Pope Pius X]], at the [[Holy See]] in Rome. \n\nDahlmann was then granted a private audience with the Pope in 1905 regarding the request. The Pius X promised to assign  the Society of Jesus to create and administer a Catholic university in Japan. In Dahlmann's [[Latin-language|Latin]] [[Memoir|memoirs]] regarding the encounter with the His Holiness, he recounted that the Pope spoke as follows: \"''Habebitis collegium in Japonica, magnam universitatem'' (in English: \"You (plural) will have in Japan a college that is a great university\".). \n\nOn that same year, the then-Bishop of [[Portland, Maine]] in the [[United States]], [[William Henry O'Connell|William H. O'Connell]], was appointed by the Pope to serve as a special ambassador of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to [[Emperor Meiji]] in Japan. O'Connell was also tasked to survey the situation in Japan. When he was granted an audience with Emperor Meiji, he had ascertained the education policy directions of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Education Ministry]], and reported to officials at the Holy See regarding the possible establishment of a Catholic university in Japan. \n\nAt the 25th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus in held in Rome on September 1906, Pius X issued a formal written statement to the Jesuits to establish a Catholic university in Japan. Thus, the delegates at the Congregation voted unanimously in favour of the Pope's commands, and the first concrete steps were taken to prepare a university institution in the East <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/aboutsophia/history/spirit/spirit_02.html|title=The Society of Jesus and the founding of Sophia University|last=Luhmer, SJ|first=Klaus|website=Sophia University|publisher=Sophia University|publication-place=Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== History of the University After Its Establishment ===\n[[File:Sophia University,1914.jpg|thumb|An academic building at Sophia University, a year after its establishment.]]\n[[File:Sophia University,1945.jpg|thumb|Sophia University in 1945.]]\nSophia University was founded by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s in 1913. It opened with departments of German Literature, Philosophy and Commerce, headed by its founder Fr. Hermann Hoffmann, SJ (1864\u20131937) as its first official president.<ref>{{cite web| title =Hoffman | url =http://www.con-spiration.de/syre/english/jun/e0601.html }}</ref>\n\nIn 1932, a small group of Sophia University students refused to salute the war dead at [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in the presence of a [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese military]] attache, saying it violated their [[Faith in Christianity|religious beliefs]]. The military attache was withdrawn from Sophia as a result of this incident, damaging the university's reputation in the eyes of the government of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] <!-- 'damaging in whose eyes? -->. The Archbishop of Tokyo intervened in the standoff by permitting Catholic students to salute the war dead, after which many Sophia students, as well as Hermann Hoffmann himself, participated in rites at Yasukuni. The [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] later issued the ''Pluries Instanterque'' in 1936, which encouraged [[Catholicism|Catholics]] to attend [[Shinto shrine]]s as a [[patriotism|patriotic]] gesture; the Vatican re-issued this document after the war in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Breen|first=John|title=Popes, Bishops and War Criminals: reflections on Catholics and Yasukuni in post-war Japan|journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|date=1 March 2010|url= http://www.japanfocus.org/-John-Breen/3312|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nSophia University continued to grow by increasing the numbers of departments, faculty members and students, in addition to advancing its international focus by establishing an exchange program. Many of its students studied at [[Georgetown University]] in the United States as early as 1935. Sophia's junior college was established in 1973, followed by the opening of Sophia Community College in 1976. With the founding of the Faculty of Liberal Arts in 2006, Sophia University presently holds 27 departments in its eight faculties. Its current president is Yoshiaki Terumichi. Toshiaki Koso serves as head of its board of directors. Since 2008, the Global Leadership Program was started for students from four [[Jesuit]] universities in [[East Asia]]: [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] in [[Taiwan]], [[Sogang University]] in [[South Korea]], and Sophia University in Japan.<ref>[http://hompi.sogang.ac.kr/2009glp/2009glp_f_1_1.html Profile], hompi.sogang.ac.kr; accessed 22 September 2014.</ref> In 2016 the University reached out to the four Jesuit junior-senior high schools in Japan, joining them in the Sophia College Corporation to help them pass on the Jesuit charism to their lay faculty through workshops and other assistance.

Most references to agricultural biodiversity date from the late 1990s onwards. \n\nWhile similar, different definitions are used by different bodies to describe biodiversity in connection with food production. CGIAR tends to use agricultural biodiversity or agrobiodiversity, while the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) uses 'biodiversity for food and agriculture' and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) uses the term 'agricultural diversity'. The CBD more or less (but not entirely) excludes marine aquatic organisms and forestry in its usage because they have their own groups and international frameworks for discussion of international policies and actions.

It can refer to the naturally occurring genetic variability within and between populations of a species, for example [[Crop wild relative|wild relatives of food crops]], or to the variability created by humans, for example farmer-developed traditional crop varieties called [[landrace]]s, or commercially bred varieties of a crop (e.g. different apple varieties: Fuji, Golden Delicious, Golden Pippin, etc.). There is considerable genetic diversity within all food crop species, particularly in [[Center of origin|centres of origin]], which are the geographical areas where species were originally developed. For example, the Andean region of Peru is a centre of origin for certain tuber species, and over 1,483 varieties of these species can be found there. Genetic diversity is important as different genes give rise to important traits, such as nutrient composition, hardiness to different environments, resistance to pests, or ample harvests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hajjar|first=Reem|last2=Jarvis|first2=Devra I.|last3=Gemmill-Herren|first3=Barbara|date=2008|title=The utility of crop genetic diversity in maintaining ecosystem services|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment|language=en|volume=123|issue=4|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2007.08.003}}</ref> Genetic diversity is decreasing due to agricultural modernization, changing land use and climate change, among other factors.

The number of species considered to contribute to food alone ranges from 5,538 to 75,000 depending on definitions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bioversity International|title=Mainstreaming Agrobiodiversity in Sustainable Food Systems: Scientific Foundations for an Agrobiodiversity Index|publisher=Bioversity International|year=2017|isbn=978-92-9255-070-7|location=Rome, Italy|pages=3}}</ref> A conservative estimate is that about 6,000 species are commonly used for food. Species diversity includes \"the domesticated plants and animals that are part of crop, livestock, forest or aquaculture systems, harvested forest and aquatic species, the wild relatives of domesticated species, and other wild species harvested for food and other products. It also encompasses what is known as \u201cassociated biodiversity\u201d, the vast range of organisms that live in and around food and agricultural production systems, sustaining them and contributing to their output.\" Agriculture is understood to include crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/state-of-biodiversity-for-food-agriculture/en/|title=The State of the World's Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture|last=FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAquatic diversity is an important component of agricultural biodiversity. The [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[sustainable]] use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, coastal commons by artisanal fisherfolk and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment.

The main service is to maintain genetic diversity of crops and species, so that it is available to maintain adaptability to new and changing climate and weather conditions. Genetic diversity is the basis of crop and livestock improvement programmes, which breed new varieties of crops and livestock in response to consumer demand and farmers' needs. An important source of genetic diversity are [[crop wild relative]]s, wild plant species that are genetically related to cultivated crops. A second supporting service is to maintain the habitat of wild biodiversity, particularly associated biodiversity, for example [[pollinator]]s and predators. Agrobiodiversity can support wild biodiversity through the use of field margins, riparian corridors, hedgerows and clumps of trees, which provide and connect habitats. A further supporting service is maintaining healthy [[Soil biology|soil biota]].\n\n=== Regulating ===\nAgrobiodiversity makes several contributions to regulating services, which control the natural processes needed for a healthy agroecosystem.

It can refer to the naturally occurring genetic variability within and between populations of a species, for example [[Crop wild relative|wild relatives of food crops]], or to the variability created by humans, for example farmer-developed traditional crop varieties called [[landrace]]s, or commercially bred varieties of a crop (e.g. different apple varieties: Fuji, Golden Delicious, Golden Pippin, etc.). There is considerable genetic diversity within all food crop species, particularly in [[Center of origin|centres of origin]], which are the geographical areas where species were originally developed. For example, the Andean region of Peru is a centre of origin for certain tuber species, and over 1,483 varieties of these species can be found there. Genetic diversity is important as different genes give rise to important traits, such as nutrient composition, hardiness to different environments, resistance to pests, or ample harvests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hajjar|first=Reem|last2=Jarvis|first2=Devra I.|last3=Gemmill-Herren|first3=Barbara|date=2008|title=The utility of crop genetic diversity in maintaining ecosystem services|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment|language=en|volume=123|issue=4|pages=261\u2013270|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2007.08.003}}</ref> Genetic diversity is decreasing due to agricultural modernization, changing land use and climate change, among other factors.

Species diversity includes \"the domesticated plants and animals that are part of crop, livestock, forest or aquaculture systems, harvested forest and aquatic species, the wild relatives of domesticated species, and other wild species harvested for food and other products. It also encompasses what is known as \u201cassociated biodiversity\u201d, the vast range of organisms that live in and around food and agricultural production systems, sustaining them and contributing to their output.\" Agriculture is understood to include crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/state-of-biodiversity-for-food-agriculture/en/|title=The State of the World's Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture|last=FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAquatic diversity is an important component of agricultural biodiversity.

The main service is to maintain genetic diversity of crops and species, so that it is available to maintain adaptability to new and changing climate and weather conditions. Genetic diversity is the basis of crop and livestock improvement programmes, which breed new varieties of crops and livestock in response to consumer demand and farmers' needs. An important source of genetic diversity are [[crop wild relative]]s, wild plant species that are genetically related to cultivated crops. A second supporting service is to maintain the habitat of wild biodiversity, particularly associated biodiversity, for example [[pollinator]]s and predators. Agrobiodiversity can support wild biodiversity through the use of field margins, riparian corridors, hedgerows and clumps of trees, which provide and connect habitats. A further supporting service is maintaining healthy [[Soil biology|soil biota]].\n\n=== Regulating ===\nAgrobiodiversity makes several contributions to regulating services, which control the natural processes needed for a healthy agroecosystem.

Genetic vulnerability occurs when there is little genetic diversity within a population of plants. This lack of diversity makes the population as a whole particularly vulnerable to disease, pests, or other factors. The problem of genetic vulnerability often arises with modern crop varieties, which are uniform by design.<ref>Virchow, Detlef.

''Ex situ'' conservation is considered a relatively reliable way of maintaining genetic diversity, since it is usually preserved over the longer term \u00a0and is less prone to change. The diversity of much of the world's major crops has been extensively collected and conserved in genebanks.
