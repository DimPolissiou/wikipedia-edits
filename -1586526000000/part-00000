As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"A '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory|Paris Conservatory]], where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\"\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in Naples.\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory took over the entire curriculum of the child apprentices in Naples but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\"'''Tobias Cramm:''' 300 years ago in Napoli, music students were prepared for a position in church or court where they would be required to constantly produce and compose music. The king or duke expected the music to be freshly composed for the upcoming event, and according to the latest fashion. \nMusicologists have been interested in this Neapolitan tradition for the last 25 years and I applied this with Alma Deutscher. When we started\u00a0 working together we would improvise back and forth without any rules, using these basslines. We would create little pieces and I observed how her skills and musical ideas became richer and\u00a0 more structured. It gave her a vocabulary.\" Tobias Cramm Pianoways interview. \n \n\"In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition.\" Monuments of Partimento \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n'''Partimento and Today''' \nWe do not know really how it was taught as there as there is no audio or video however it is believed to be live at a keyboard. Before partimento a long course for '''3 years''' would begin in singing with the teacher . Finally some boys would be chosen to play partimenti and the others would remain singers. While taking these partimenti lessons '''an entire day from dusk till dawn was spent with music learning thousands of things for many years'''. This type of learning  may accelerate progress but likely '''at the cost of other activities for younger students'''  and so a class of 1 time a week for 30 min or an hour will likely suffice while they take lessons in day to day things outside of music. There are many fine teachers that can integrate these ideas into their normal didactic for music , such as reading , finger techniques , singing  etc to compliment. At some point precocious children like Alma Deutscher and other child phenoms that now follow - based on internet reports of an annual symposium \"the Mentiparti\"  initiative of Tobias Cramm - will need to move into other areas if they have not already done so or it will be paint by numbers. A potential pitfall.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|''It may help first to contrast the social and professional status of students today and then. In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition. The styles of that time required fluency in writing for ensembles, and so counterpoint\u2014fitting multiple voices or parts together\u2014was the skill to be mastered. Voices sounding together do make harmonies, but the focus was on the voices and the control of consonance and dissonance.''\n|-\n}\n'''Partimenti were typically used as exercises''' to train as more advanced models of simple exemplars to accelerate progress in making stock music for rapid sale at church and opera. Similar in many ways to current professionals use of loops and templates in electronic music production. Models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]]. \n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

Bass motions move in a conjunct (stepwise, including chromatic) motion or disjunct motion (sequences).{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=135}}\n\n=== Rises by a 3rd and falls by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 e d f e g f a g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by a 3rd and rises by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 a b g a f g e f d e c g' c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 4th and falls by a 3rd ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 f d g e a  f g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n=== Falls by a 4th and rises by a step ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 g a e f c g' c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 4th and falls by a 5th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                g1 c fis, b e, a d, g c, d g,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by a 5th and rises by a 4th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c1 f, bes es, as d, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n=== Rises by a 5th and falls by a 4th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 g' d a' e b' g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Rises by a 6th and falls by a 5th ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key c \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                c,1 a' d, b' e, c' f, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Falls by semitone ===\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                g1 fis f!

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"A '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory|Paris Conservatory]], where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\"\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in Naples.\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory took over the entire curriculum of the child apprentices in Naples but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\"'''Tobias Cramm:''' 300 years ago in Napoli, music students were prepared for a position in church or court where they would be required to constantly produce and compose music. The king or duke expected the music to be freshly composed for the upcoming event, and according to the latest fashion. \nMusicologists have been interested in this Neapolitan tradition for the last 25 years and I applied this with Alma Deutscher. When we started\u00a0 working together we would improvise back and forth without any rules, using these basslines. We would create little pieces and I observed how her skills and musical ideas became richer and\u00a0 more structured. It gave her a vocabulary.\" Tobias Cramm Pianoways interview. \n \n\"In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition.\" Monuments of Partimento \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\nNotable modern partimenti players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, John Mortensen, Nicoleta Paraschivescu, \n\n'''Partimento and Today''' \nWe do not know really how it was taught as there as there is no audio or video however it is believed to be live at a keyboard. Before partimento a long course for '''3 years''' would begin in singing with the teacher . Finally some boys would be chosen to play partimenti and the others would remain singers. While taking these partimenti lessons '''an entire day from dusk till dawn was spent with music learning thousands of things for many years'''. This type of learning  may accelerate progress but likely '''at the cost of other activities for younger students'''  and so a class of 1 time a week for 30 min or an hour will likely suffice while they take lessons in day to day things outside of music. There are many fine teachers that can integrate these ideas into their normal didactic for music , such as reading , finger techniques , singing  etc to compliment. At some point precocious children like Alma Deutscher and other child phenoms that now follow - based on internet reports of an annual symposium \"the Mentiparti\"  initiative of Tobias Cramm - will need to move into other areas if they have not already done so or it will be paint by numbers. A potential pitfall.\n\n'''Disappearance'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|''It may help first to contrast the social and professional status of students today and then. In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition. The styles of that time required fluency in writing for ensembles, and so counterpoint\u2014fitting multiple voices or parts together\u2014was the skill to be mastered. Voices sounding together do make harmonies, but the focus was on the voices and the control of consonance and dissonance.''\n|-\n}\n'''Partimenti were typically used as exercises''' to train as more advanced models of simple exemplars to accelerate progress in making stock music for rapid sale at church and opera. Similar in many ways to current professionals use of loops and templates in electronic music production. Models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]]. \n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass.

The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful.

Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

Subcritical tests not involving a [[critical mass]] continued.\n\n[[File:Sedan Plowshare Crater.jpg|thumb|[[Sedan crater]]]]\nOne notable test shot was the \"[[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan]]\" shot of [[Operation Storax]] on July 6, 1962, a {{convert|104|ktonTNT|adj=on}} shot for [[Operation Plowshare]], which sought to prove that nuclear weapons could be used for peaceful means in creating bays or canals.

On February 22, 2007, the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA) officially canceled the experiment.

Other such structures included military fortifications (of types used by both [[NATO]] and the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]]) and civil-defense as well as \"backyard\"-type shelters. In such a typical test, several of the same buildings and structures might be built using the same layouts and plans with different types of materials, paints, general landscaping, cleanliness of the surrounding yards, wall-angles or varying distances from ground zero. Mannequins were placed in and around the test vehicles and buildings, aside from some left out in the open, for testing clothing and shock effects.\n\nHigh-speed cameras were placed in protected locations to capture effects of radiation and shock waves. Typical imagery from these cameras shows paint boiling off the buildings, which are then pushed violently away from ground zero by the shock wave before being drawn toward the detonation by the suction caused by the climbing mushroom cloud. Footage from these cameras has become iconic, used in various media and available in the public domain and on DVD.<ref>{{citation| title=Operation Cue (1964 revision)| publisher=U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Civil Defense| year=1964| url=https://archive.org/details/Operatio1964| access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis testing allowed the development of Civil Defense guidelines, distributed to the public, to increase the likelihood of survival in case of air- or spaceborne nuclear attack.\n\n==Environmental impact==\nEach of the below ground explosions\u2014some as deep as 5,000 feet (1.5&nbsp;km)\u2014vaporized a large chamber, leaving a cavity filled with [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] rubble.
