Meles was elected member of the leadership committee in 1979 and chairman of the executive committee of TPLF in 1983. He was the chairperson of both the TPLF and the EPRDF after the EPRDF assumed power at the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] in 1991.

Accordingly, he maintained that the big support it received from peasants and rural areas helped EPRDF maintain peace and stability. Foreign support was diverse; the [[Arab League]], as well as Western nations, supported the EPRDF rebels against the communist Moscow-supported government (although the TPLF was at the time [[Marxism|Marxist]]) at the height of the Cold War.\n\n\"What the implications of this will be in terms of relations between Ethiopia and the European Union, we will have to wait and see but I don't think you will be surprised if Ethiopia were to insist that it should not be patronised.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkexist.com/quotes/meles_zenawi/|title=Meles Zenawi quotes|author=ThinkExist.com Quotations|publisher=Thinkexist.com|accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe United States facilitated peace talks between different rebel groups including EPRDF and the Derg to bring an end to civil war which lasted for 17 years and reach some kind of political settlement in 1991.<ref name=\"www1.umn.edu\">http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/ins/ethiopia_amharas_93.html</ref> The talks didn't bear any fruit as EPRDF's force were moving to the capital and Mengistu fled the country.

The man who led our country for the past 21 years and brought economic and democratic changes, has died. We have lost our respected leader. Meles has been receiving treatment abroad. He was getting better and we were expecting him to return to Addis Ababa. But he developed a sudden infection and died around 11:40pm last night. His body will be returned to Ethiopia soon. We have set up a committee to organise his funeral. More information will be released about that soon. As per Ethiopian law, Hailemariam Desalegn has now taken over the leadership. He will also be in charge of the Ethiopian military and all other government institutions. I would like to stress, nothing in Ethiopia will change. The government will continue. Our policies and institutions will continue. Nothing will change in Ethiopia. Desalegn will be confirmed by parliament.</blockquote>\n\nAfter his body was repatriated two days later, thousands of mourners congregated on streets from the airport to Meles' former residence to pay their last respects as his coffin, draped in the [[flag of Ethiopia]], was accompanied by a military band.

name=\"Lee2001\"/> Kim's birthday, which had been an official holiday since 1968, was renamed Day of the Sun in 1997, three years after [[death of Kim Il-sung|his death]]. The name takes its significance from his name; [[Il-sung]] is [[Korean language|Korean]] for \"become the Sun\".\n\nNorth Koreans commemorate the holiday by visiting locations that have a connection with the leader's life, such as thousands of statues scattered across the country, or [[Mangyongdae]], his birthplace in the capital [[Pyongyang]]. The most important observances take place in the capital, including visits to the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun]], where Kim Il-sung's body lies in rest, and the [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument|Mansudae Grand Monument]], which features a very tall statue of the leader. \n\nThe state seeks to provide its citizens with more food and electricity than is normally available, but success is not always guaranteed.<ref name=\"dail_Spec\"/> Children, in particular, receive candy and other gifts attributed to the love shown by the leaders.<ref name=\"dail_KimI\"/>\n\nFestivities are not confined to the date. Commemorations occur from 16 February, which is the birthday of [[Kim Jong-il]], during what is known as the Loyalty Festival. Celebrations in April around the Day of the Sun are called the Sun Festival. The day itself is followed by two days of rest, making it a three-day holiday.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kim Il-sung's birthplace.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of [[Kim Il-sung]] in [[Mangyongdae]]]]\n[[Kim Il-sung]] was born on 15 April 1912 in the village of [[Mangyongdae]], which is now a suburb of [[North Korea]]'s capital [[Pyongyang]].<ref name=\"Corfield2014\">{{cite book|last=Corfield|first=Justin|title=Historical Dictionary of Pyongyang|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79|year=2014|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-78308-341-1|page=79|chapter=Kim Il Sung}}</ref> He has been long identified with the [[Sun]]<ref name=\"Lee2001\"/> and is frequently called \"Sun of the nation\".<ref name=\"worl_KBSW\"/> He adopted his name [[Il-sung]] ({{korean|hangul=\uc77c\uc131|hanja=\u65e5\u6210|context=north}}), meaning \"become the Sun\"<ref name=\"Martin2007\">{{cite book|first=Bradley K.|last=Martin|title=Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZx6hOCNukC&pg=PT48|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=1 April 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4299-0699-9|page=48|via = Google Books}}</ref> before the early 1930s as one of his ''[[noms de guerre]]''.<ref name=\"Lim201588\">{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Leader Symbols and Personality Cult in North Korea: The Leader State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcwqBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT136|accessdate=3 May 2015|date=24 March 2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-56740-0|via = Google Books|page=88}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nKim Il-sung's birthday had been designated as a provisional holiday in 1962.
