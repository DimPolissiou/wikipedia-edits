In Central America, they usually occupy the wet lowland forests on the [[Geography of Costa Rica|Caribbean coast of Costa Rica]] and Panama and deciduous dry forest on the Pacific coast.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"capuchin\" derives from a group of [[friar]]s named the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]], an offshoot from the [[Franciscan]]s, who wear brown robes with large hoods. When Portuguese explorers reached the [[Americas]] in the 15th century, they found small monkeys whose coloring resembled these friars, especially when in their robes with hoods down, and named them capuchins.<ref name=Fragaszy/> When the scientists described a specimen (thought to be a [[golden-bellied capuchin]]) they noted that: \"his muzzle of a tanned color,... with the lighter color around his eyes that melts into the white at the front, his cheeks..., give him the looks that involuntarily reminds us of the appearance that historically in our country represents ignorance, laziness, and sensuality.\"<ref>{{cite book |author1=Saint-Hilaire, E.

Lynch Alfaro suspects that the divergence was triggered by the creation of the Amazon River, which separated the monkeys in the Amazon north of the Amazon River, who then evolved into the gracile capuchins.  Those in the Atlantic Forest south of the river evolved into the robust capuchins. Gracile capuchins have longer limbs relative to their body size than robust capuchins, and have rounder skulls, whereas robust capuchins have jaws better adapted for opening hard nuts.

Capuchin monkeys are usually dark brown with a cream/off white coloring around their necks. They reach a length of {{convert|30|to|56|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, with tails that are just as long as the body. On average, they weigh from 3 to 9 pounds and live up to 25 years old in their natural habitats.\n\n==Behavior==\nLike most New World monkeys, capuchins are [[diurnality|diurnal]] and [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]]. With the exception of a midday nap, they spend their entire day searching for food. At night, they sleep in the trees, wedged between branches. They are undemanding regarding their habitat and can thus be found in many differing areas.\n\n[[File:Cebus albifrons edit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|White-fronted capuchin (''Cebus albifrons'')]]\n\n===Diet===\nThe capuchin monkey feeds on a vast range of food types, and is more varied than other monkeys in the family [[Cebidae]].

They are particularly abundant in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru. They use these areas for the shelter at night and food access during the day. The canopy of the trees allow for protection from threats above, and the Capuchin Monkeys innate ability to climb trees with ease allows for them to escape and hide from predators on the jungle floor. This environment is mutually beneficial for the Capuchins and for the ecosystem in which they inhabit. This is because they spread their seed leftovers and fecal matter across the forest floor which helps new plants to grow, therefore adding to the already abundant foliage that shelters the Capuchin.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Mating===\nCapuchin females often direct most of their proceptive and mating behavior towards the alpha male.

Females bare young every two years following a 160- to 180-day gestation.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The young cling to their mother's chest until they are larger, then they move to her back. Adult male Capuchin rarely take part in caring for the young. Juveniles become fully mature within four years for females and eight years for males. In captivity, individuals have reached an age of 50 years, although natural life expectancy is only 15 to 25 years. Capuchins live in groups of 6-40 members, consisting of related females, their offspring and several males.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Threats==\nCapuchin monkeys are clever and easy to train. As a result, they are used to help people who are [[quadriplegic]]s in many developed countries. They have also become popular pets and attractions for street entertainment, and are hunted for meat by local people. Since they have a high reproductive rate and can easily adapt to their living environment, loss of the forest does not negatively impact the Capuchin monkey populations as much as other species, although [[habitat fragmentation]] is still a threat.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sanz | first1 = V | last2 = M\u00e1rquez | first2 = L | year = 1994 | title = Conservaci\u00f3n del mono capuchino de Margarita (''Cebus apella margaritae'') en la Isla de Margarita, Venezuela | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263965664| journal = Neotrop Primates | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 5\u20138 }}</ref> Natural predators include jaguars, cougars, [[Jaguarundi|jaguarundis]], coyotes, [[Tayra|tayras]], snakes, crocodiles and birds of prey.

An experiment with Capuchins shows that they react to a reflection as a strange phenomenon, but not as if seeing a strange Capuchin.\n\nIn the experiment, Capuchins were presented with three different scenarios:\n# Seeing an unfamiliar, same-sex monkey on the other side of a clear barrier\n# Seeing a familiar, same-sex monkey on the other side of a clear barrier\n# A mirror showing a reflection of the monkey\n\nWith scenario 1, females appeared anxious and avoided eye-contact, while males made threatening gestures. In scenario 2, there was little reaction by either males or females.\n\nWhen presented with a reflection, females gazed into their own eyes and made friendly gestures, such as lip-smacking and swaying. Males made more eye contact than with strangers or familiar monkeys, but reacted with signs of confusion or distress, such as squealing, curling up on the floor, or trying to escape from the test room.<ref>{{cite journal | author=de Waal, F.

Lynch Alfaro suspects that the divergence was triggered by the creation of the Amazon River, which separated the monkeys in the Amazon north of the Amazon River, who then evolved into the gracile capuchins.  Those in the Atlantic Forest south of the river evolved into the robust capuchins. Gracile capuchins have longer limbs relative to their body size than robust capuchins, and have rounder skulls, whereas robust capuchins have jaws better adapted for opening hard nuts.

Capuchin monkeys are usually dark brown with a cream/off white coloring around their necks. They reach a length of {{convert|30|to|56|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, with tails that are just as long as the body. On average, they weigh from 3 to 9 pounds and live up to 25 years old in their natural habitats.\n\n==Behavior==\nLike most New World monkeys, capuchins are [[diurnality|diurnal]] and [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]]. With the exception of a midday nap, they spend their entire day searching for food. At night, they sleep in the trees, wedged between branches.

They are particularly abundant in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru. They use these areas for the shelter at night and food access during the day. The canopy of the trees allow for protection from threats above, and the Capuchin Monkeys innate ability to climb trees with ease allows for them to escape and hide from predators on the jungle floor. This environment is mutually beneficial for the Capuchins and for the ecosystem in which they inhabit. This is because they spread their seed leftovers and fecal matter across the forest floor which helps new plants to grow, therefore adding to the already abundant foliage that shelters the Capuchin.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Mating===\nCapuchin females often direct most of their proceptive and mating behavior towards the alpha male.

It is the earliest known discovery of monkey to travel between South and North America, although it is still unknown as to how this species traveled from continent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/monkey-ancestors-rafted-across-sea-north-america|title=Monkey ancestors rafted across the sea to North America|last=WadeApr. 20|first=Lizzie|last2=2016|date=2016-04-20|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12|last3=Pm|first3=2:00}}</ref> Researcher Lynch Alfaro stated that the gracille Capuchin Monkey genera arose about 6.2 million years ago, and the modern Capuchin culture emerged within the last century. It is this early species that set the stage for the Capuchin to thrive in Central American forests today. {{cn|date=March 2020}} The Capuchin has been known to roam these forests these forests for years and their population has boomed, the area in which they inhabit allows for the Capuchin offspring to thrive. the reproduction of these particular monkeys does not differ much from its fellow primates. Capuchins are polygamous, and the females mate throughout the year, but only go through a gestation period once every 2 years between December and April. Females bare young every two years following a 160- to 180-day gestation.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The young cling to their mother's chest until they are larger, then they move to her back. Adult male Capuchin rarely take part in caring for the young. Juveniles become fully mature within four years for females and eight years for males. In captivity, individuals have reached an age of 50 years, although natural life expectancy is only 15 to 25 years. Capuchins live in groups of 6-40 members, consisting of related females, their offspring and several males.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Threats==\nCapuchin monkeys are clever and easy to train. As a result, they are used to help people who are [[quadriplegic]]s in many developed countries. They have also become popular pets and attractions for street entertainment, and are hunted for meat by local people. Since they have a high reproductive rate and can easily adapt to their living environment, loss of the forest does not negatively impact the Capuchin monkey populations as much as other species, although [[habitat fragmentation]] is still a threat.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sanz | first1 = V | last2 = M\u00e1rquez | first2 = L | year = 1994 | title = Conservaci\u00f3n del mono capuchino de Margarita (''Cebus apella margaritae'') en la Isla de Margarita, Venezuela | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263965664| journal = Neotrop Primates | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 5\u20138 }}</ref> Natural predators include jaguars, cougars, [[Jaguarundi|jaguarundis]], coyotes, [[Tayra|tayras]], snakes, crocodiles and birds of prey.

Upon seeing [[macaw]]s eating [[Oil palm|palm nuts]], cracking them open with their beaks, this monkey will select a few of the ripest fruits, nip off the tip of the fruit and drink down the juice, then seemingly discard the rest of the fruit with the nut inside. When these discarded fruits have hardened and become slightly brittle, the Capuchin will gather them up again and take them to a large flat boulder where they have previously gathered a few river stones from up to a mile away. They will then use these stones, some of them weighing as much as the monkeys, to crack open the fruit to get to the nut inside.

An experiment with Capuchins shows that they react to a reflection as a strange phenomenon, but not as if seeing a strange Capuchin.\n\nIn the experiment, Capuchins were presented with three different scenarios:\n# Seeing an unfamiliar, same-sex monkey on the other side of a clear barrier\n# Seeing a familiar, same-sex monkey on the other side of a clear barrier\n# A mirror showing a reflection of the monkey\n\nWith scenario 1, females appeared anxious and avoided eye-contact, while males made threatening gestures. In scenario 2, there was little reaction by either males or females.\n\nWhen presented with a reflection, females gazed into their own eyes and made friendly gestures, such as lip-smacking and swaying. Males made more eye contact than with strangers or familiar monkeys, but reacted with signs of confusion or distress, such as squealing, curling up on the floor, or trying to escape from the test room.<ref>{{cite journal | author=de Waal, F.

It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=190|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==

{"title_page": "Rear admiral", "text_new": "{{short description|Naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}\n{{Military ranks}}\n{{Navalranks}}\n'''Rear admiral''' is a senior [[naval]] [[flag officer]] rank, equivalent to a [[major general]] and [[air vice marshal]] and above that of a [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and [[Captain (naval)|captain]], but below that of a [[vice admiral]]. It is regarded as a two star \"[[admiral]]\" rank. In many navies it is referred to as (OF-8)/(O-8).\n\nIt originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the [[Royal Navy]].  Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head, who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron.  The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle.  In the rear of the naval squadron, a third admiral would command the remaining ships and, as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals.

It is regarded as a two star \"[[admiral]]\" rank. In many navies it is referred to as (OF-8)/(O-8).\n\nIt originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the [[Royal Navy]].  Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head, who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron.  The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle.  In the rear of the naval squadron, a third admiral would command the remaining ships and, as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals. This has survived into the modern age, with the rank of rear admiral the most-junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies.\n\nIn some European navies (e.g., that of [[French Navy|France]]), and in the Canadian Forces' French rank translations, the rank of rear admiral is known as ''[[contre-amiral]]''.

[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n[[File:Treadmill_Omni.jpg|thumb|A Omni treadmill being used at a VR convention.]]\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically \n\nincludes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is sometimes defined as a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the modern virtual reality headsets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title=\"Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments\", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|chapter=Section 17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VPL DataSuit 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A [[VPL Research]] DataSuit, a full-body outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms, legs, and trunk.

Well-known formats include head-mounted displays or the CAVE. In order to convey a spatial impression, two images are generated and displayed from different perspectives (stereo projection). There are different technologies available to bring the respective image to the right eye.

These include the [[3d mouse|3D mouse]], the [[wired glove]], [[motion controller]]s, and [[Optical tracking instruments|optical tracking]] sensors. Controllers typically use optical tracking systems (primarily [[infrared camera]]<nowiki/>s) for location and navigation, so that the user can move freely without wiring. Some input devices provide the user with [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] to the hands or other parts of the body, so that the human being can orientate himself in the three-dimensional world through haptics and sensor technology as a further sensory sensation and carry out realistic simulations. This allows for the viewer to have a sense of direction in the artificial landscape. Additional haptic feedback can be obtained from [[omnidirectional treadmill]]s (with which walking in virtual space is controlled by real walking movements) and vibration gloves and suits.\n\nVirtual reality cameras can be used to create [[VR photography]] using [[360-degree video|360-degree panorama videos]]. 360-degree camera shots can be mixed with virtual elements to merge reality and fiction through special effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} VR cameras are available in various formats, with varying numbers of lenses installed in the camera.\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Main|Applications of virtual reality}}\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Erisa Hines speak to members of the news media during a preview of the new Destination Mars (29712147171).jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] previewing the ''Destination: Mars'' VR experience at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in 2016]]\n\nVirtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video games and [[3D cinema]].

[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n[[File:Treadmill_Omni.jpg|thumb|A Omni treadmill being used at a VR convention.]]\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world.

Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is sometimes defined as a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms.

Some input devices provide the user with [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] to the hands or other parts of the body, so that the human being can orientate himself in the three-dimensional world through haptics and sensor technology as a further sensory sensation and carry out realistic simulations. This allows for the viewer to have a sense of direction in the artificial landscape.

Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.</ref> and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology.

One in 4,000 people, or .025%, may experience these symptoms. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment. While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fagan |first1=Kaylee |title=Here's what happens to your body when you've been in virtual reality for too long |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-reality-vr-side-effects-2018-3 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=Business Insider}}</ref>\n\nVR headsets may regularly cause eye fatigue, as does all screened technology, because people tend to blink less when watching screens, causing their eyes to become more dried out.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mukamal |first1=Reena |title=Are Virtual Reality Headsets Safe for Eyes? |url=https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/are-virtual-reality-headsets-safe-eyes |website=American Academy of Ophthalmology |accessdate=11 September 2018|date=2017-02-28 }}</ref> There have been some concerns about VR headsets contributing to myopia, but although VR headsets sit close to the eyes, they may not necessarily contribute to nearsightedness if the focal length of the image being displayed is sufficiently far away.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Langley |first1=Hugh |title=We need to look more carefully into the long-term effects of VR |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-long-term-brain-eyes-effects-6674 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018|date=2017-08-22 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helmet Vision.jpg|thumb|A virtual reality headset with a panoramic lens supposed to eliminate the symptoms of motion sickness]]\n\n[[Virtual reality sickness]] (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to [[motion sickness]] symptoms.<ref name=\"Kiryu2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Kiryu |first1=T |last2=So |first2=RH |title=Sensation of presence and cybersickness in applications of virtual reality for advanced rehabilitation |journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation |date=25 September 2007 |volume=4 |pages=34 |doi=10.1186/1743-0003-4-34 |pmid=17894857 |pmc=2117018}}</ref> Women are significantly more affected than men by headset-induced symptoms, at rates of around 77% and 33% respectively.<ref name=\"Munafo et al 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Munafo |first1=Justin |last2=Diedrick |first2=Meg |last3=Stoffregen |first3=Thomas A. |title=The virtual reality head-mounted display Oculus Rift induces motion sickness and is sexist in its effects |journal=Experimental Brain Research |date=3 December 2016 |volume=235 |issue=3 |pages=889\u2013901 |doi=10.1007/s00221-016-4846-7 |pmid=27915367 }}</ref><ref name=\"Park et al 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=George D. |last2=Allen |first2=R.

When the vestibular system, the body's internal balancing system, does not experience the motion that it expects from visual input through the eyes, the user may experience VR sickness.
