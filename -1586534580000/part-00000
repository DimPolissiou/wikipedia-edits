The song was the third track on the album and was the third track released as a single, reaching No. 4 in the U.S.<ref name=\"awards\"/> and No. 14 in the UK in late 1986.<ref name=\"UK\"/> It also reached No. 8 in the [[Netherlands]]. The music was written by the band, while the lyrics were written by guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]].<ref>{{cite web|first= Anil |last= Prasad |title= Genesis: Turning it on again |work= Innerviews |accessdate= 27 May 2012 |url= http://www.innerviews.org/inner/genesis.html}}</ref> The song's video featured puppets from the 1980s UK sketch show ''[[Spitting Image]]''.\n\n==Music video==\n{{Original research|section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:LandofConfusionscreenshot1.JPG|left|250px|thumb|The band members (Banks, Collins and Rutherford) as they appeared in the video.]]\nThe song is widely remembered for its music video, which had heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. The video features [[caricature]] puppets by the British television show ''[[Spitting Image]]''. After [[Phil Collins]] saw a caricatured version of himself on the show, he commissioned the show's creators, [[Peter Fluck]] and [[Roger Law]], to create puppets of the entire band, as well as all the characters in the video.\n\nThe video opens with a caricatured [[Ronald Reagan]] (voiced by [[Chris Barrie]]), [[Nancy Reagan]], and a monkey, going to bed at 4:30 PM. Nancy is absorbed in reading ''His Way'', [[Kitty Kelley]]'s unauthorized biography of [[Frank Sinatra]]. Reagan, holding a teddy bear, kisses the monkey goodnight and goes to sleep and begins to have a nightmar], which sets the premise for the entire video. The video intermittently features a line of stomping feet, illustrating an army marching through a swamp, and they pick up heads of [[Cold War]]-era political figures in the swamp along the way.\n\nCaricatured versions of the band members are shown playing instruments on stage during a concert: [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on an array of synthesizers (as well as a cash register full of cookies), [[Mike Rutherford]] on a [[Multi-neck guitar|four-necked guitar]], and two Phil Collins puppets: one on the drums, and one singing.\n\nDuring the second verse, the video features various world leaders giving speeches on large video screens in front of mass crowds; the video shows [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his aides, and [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Meanwhile, Reagan is shown putting on a [[Superman]] suit, fumbling along the way, while Collins sings,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nOh Superman where are you now\nWhen everything's gone wrong somehow\nThe men of steel, the men of power\nAre losing control by the hour.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, the \"real world\" Reagan is shown blowing bubbles in a puddle of his own sweat (at one point, a rubber duck floats by).\n\nDuring the bridge, the Superman-costumed Reagan and a dinosaur (with punk jewellery) watch a television showing various clips (apparently from the ''Spitting Image'' show itself), including [[Johnny Carson]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Mr. [[Spock]] (with a [[Rubik's Cube]]), and [[Bob Hope]]. This segues into a sequence apparently set in prehistoric times, where the two dinosaurs (one wearing a bow-tie) meet up with Ron and Nancy Reagan and a rather outlandish mammal eats an egg and reads a newspaper. At the end of this part, the chimpanzee from the prologue is shown throwing a bone in the air.\n\nAs the bone begins to fall there is a sudden switch to Collins catching a falling phone which he uses to inform the person on the other end that he \"won't be coming home tonight, my generation will put it right\" (which is when a caricature of a 1980s [[Pete Townshend]] is seen playing a chord on guitar and giving a thumb-up and on the \"we're not just making promises\" verse the bone lands (on top of [[David Bowie]] and [[Bob Dylan]], but misses [[Mick Jagger]]). Reagan is then shown riding a dinosaur through the streets while wearing a cowboy hat and wardrobe. As the video nears its climax, there are periodic scenes of a large group of spoofed celebrity puppets, including [[Tina Turner]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]], [[Princess Diana]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] singing along to the chorus of the song, with [[Pope John Paul II]] playing an electric guitar.\n\nAt the end of the video, Reagan awakens from his dream, and surfaces from the sweat surrounding him; Nancy at this point is wearing a [[Snorkeling|snorkel]]. After taking a drink (missing his mouth and, indeed, his face, afflicting him with \"[[Alcoholism|drinking problems]]\", [[wikt:Special:Search/a la|\u00e0 la]] ''[[Airplane!]]''), he fumbles for a button next to his bed. He intends to push the one labelled \"Nurse\", but instead presses the one titled \"[[Nuclear weapon|Nuke]]\", setting off a nuclear explosion. Reagan then replies: \"That's one heck of a nurse!\" Nancy whacks him over the head with her snorkel.\n\nThe video, directed by John Lloyd and Jim Yukich, and produced by Jon Blair, won the short-lived [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video#Recipients|Best Concept Music Video]] during the [[30th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|30th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Grammy Awards \u2013 1987 |website= [[Dotdash|About.com]] |url= http://80music.about.com/library/grammy/bl_1987.htm |archivedate= 21 September 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050921002536/http://80music.about.com/library/grammy/bl_1987.htm}}</ref> The video was also nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year]] in 1987, but lost to \"[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)|Sledgehammer]]\" by [[Peter Gabriel]] (coincidentally, Genesis' former lead singer).

The song was the third track on the album and was the third track released as a single, reaching No. 4 in the U.S.<ref name=\"awards\"/> and No. 14 in the UK in late 1986.<ref name=\"UK\"/> It also reached No. 8 in the [[Netherlands]]. The music was written by the band, while the lyrics were written by guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]].<ref>{{cite web|first= Anil |last= Prasad |title= Genesis: Turning it on again |work= Innerviews |accessdate= 27 May 2012 |url= http://www.innerviews.org/inner/genesis.html}}</ref> The song's video featured puppets from the 1980s UK sketch show ''[[Spitting Image]]''.\n\n==Music video==\n{{Original research|section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:LandofConfusionscreenshot1.JPG|left|250px|thumb|The band members (Banks, Collins and Rutherford) as they appeared in the video.]]\nThe song is widely remembered for its music video, which had heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. The video features [[caricature]] puppets by the British television show ''[[Spitting Image]]''. After [[Phil Collins]] saw a caricatured version of himself on the show, he commissioned the show's creators, [[Peter Fluck]] and [[Roger Law]], to create puppets of the entire band, as well as all the characters in the video.\n\nThe video opens with a caricatured [[Ronald Reagan]] (voiced by [[Chris Barrie]]), [[Nancy Reagan]], and a monkey, going to bed at 4:30 PM. Nancy is absorbed in reading ''His Way'', [[Kitty Kelley]]'s unauthorized biography of [[Frank Sinatra]]. Reagan, holding a teddy bear, kisses the monkey goodnight and goes to sleep and begins to have a nightmar], which sets the premise for the entire video. The video intermittently features a line of stomping feet, illustrating an army marching through a swamp, and they pick up heads of [[Cold War]]-era political figures in the swamp along the way.\n\nCaricatured versions of the band members are shown playing instruments on stage during a concert: [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on an array of synthesizers (as well as a cash register full of cookies), [[Mike Rutherford]] on a [[Multi-neck guitar|four-necked guitar]], and two Phil Collins puppets: one on the drums, and one singing.\n\nDuring the second verse, the video features various world leaders giving speeches on large video screens in front of mass crowds; the video shows [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his aides, and [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Meanwhile, Reagan is shown putting on a [[Superman]] suit, fumbling along the way, while Collins sings,\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nOh Superman where are you now\nWhen everything's gone wrong somehow\nThe men of steel, the men of power\nAre losing control by the hour.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, the \"real world\" Reagan is shown blowing bubbles in a puddle of his own sweat (at one point, a rubber duck floats by).\n\nDuring the bridge, the Superman-costumed Reagan and a dinosaur (with punk jewellery) watch a television showing various clips (apparently from the ''Spitting Image'' show itself), including [[Johnny Carson]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Mr. [[Spock]] (with a [[Rubik's Cube]]), and [[Bob Hope]]. This segues into a sequence apparently set in prehistoric times, where the two dinosaurs (one wearing a bow-tie) meet up with Ron and Nancy Reagan and a rather outlandish mammal eats an egg and reads a newspaper. At the end of this part, the chimpanzee from the prologue is shown throwing a bone in the air.\n\nAs the bone begins to fall there is a sudden switch to Collins catching a falling phone which he uses to inform the person on the other end that he \"won't be coming home tonight, my generation will put it right\" (which is when a caricature of a 1980s [[Pete Townshend]] is seen playing a chord on guitar and giving a thumb-up and on the \"we're not just making promises\" verse the bone lands (on top of [[David Bowie]] and [[Bob Dylan]], but misses [[Mick Jagger]]). Reagan is then shown riding a dinosaur through the streets while wearing a cowboy hat and wardrobe. As the video nears its climax, there are periodic scenes of a large group of spoofed celebrity puppets, including [[Tina Turner]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]], [[Princess Diana]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] singing along to the chorus of the song, with [[Pope John Paul II]] playing an electric guitar.\n\nAt the end of the video, Reagan awakens from his dream, and surfaces from the sweat surrounding him; Nancy at this point is wearing a [[Snorkeling|snorkel]]. After taking a drink (missing his mouth and, indeed, his face, afflicting him with \"[[Alcoholism|drinking problems]]\", [[wikt:Special:Search/a la|\u00e0 la]] ''[[Airplane!]]''), he fumbles for a button next to his bed. He intends to push the one labelled \"Nurse\", but instead presses the one titled \"[[Nuclear weapon|Nuke]]\", setting off a nuclear explosion. Reagan then replies: \"That's one heck of a nurse!\" Nancy whacks him over the head with her snorkel.\n\nThe video, directed by John Lloyd and Jim Yukich, and produced by Jon Blair, won the short-lived [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video#Recipients|Best Concept Music Video]] during the [[30th Annual Grammy Awards#Award winners|30th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Grammy Awards \u2013 1987 |website= [[Dotdash|About.com]] |url= http://80music.about.com/library/grammy/bl_1987.htm |archivedate= 21 September 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050921002536/http://80music.about.com/library/grammy/bl_1987.htm}}</ref> The video was also nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year]] in 1987, but lost to \"[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)|Sledgehammer]]\" by [[Peter Gabriel]] (coincidentally, Genesis' former lead singer).

One such example is ''[[Homeworld 2]]'', which requires the program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even [[open-source software|open-source]] modeling programs (such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]]) that can be used as well.\n\nFor advanced mods such as ''[[Desert Combat]]'' that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software is required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.\n\nA game that allows modding is said to be \"moddable\". ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' as well as its predecessors, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. ''[[Daggerfall]]'' was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as ''Gunslingers Academy'' have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' set out to be the 'most customisable game ever' and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe games industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players' contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes(IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.<ref>Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\" in Terry Flew, New Media: an introduction (second edition), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Portability issues===\nFor cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or [[Linux]] ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher's concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ported by [[Aspyr]] for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as ''Red Orchestra'' and ''Metaball''.\n\nAlso, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of ''[[Doom 3]]'', are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. [[id Software]]'s Doom 3 Radiant tool and [[Epic Games]]' [[UnrealEd]] are examples of this.\n\nMod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.\n\nThe mod specialist site for Macs, [[Macologist]], has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.\n\n===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===\nIn January 2005, it was reported that in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website's ''exchange'' feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305070257/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6857 Supernatural powers become contagious in PC game] by Will Knight, NewScientist, 7 January 2005</ref>\n\nAfter the Hot Coffee mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  There is concern about mods which show nudity, and Bestheda does not allow mods with nudity to be uploaded on its website.

This can also include adding revised dialog and music.\n\nExamples of overhaul mods include ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]: Revision'', which was given permission from publisher [[Square Enix]] to release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] alongside the original game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9521011/deus-ex-revision-mod-release-steam|title=A massive overhaul for the original Deus Ex is now available on Steam|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2015-10-13|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V|GTA 5]] Redux'', which not only improves the original game's textures, but also adds a new weather system, visual effects, and adjusts the wanted system, weapons, and vehicle handling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-gorgeous-gta-5-graphics-overhaul-mod-is-final/1100-6443721/|title=That Gorgeous GTA 5 Graphics Overhaul Mod Is Finally Available|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2016-09-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref>\n\n===Randomizer===\nRandomizers are a type of user mod, typically atop games of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge. Randomizers came out of the [[speedrunning]] community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' around 2015. In the ''Zelda'' randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurely generated manner (similar to [[roguelikes]]) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/what-happens-when-you-randomize-the-legend-of-zelda-1758777271 | title = What Happens When You Randomize The Legend Of Zelda | first=  John  |last =Harris | date= February 2, 2016 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/ | title = How \"randomizers\" are breathing new life into old games | first = Scott | last = White | date = December 3, 2019 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\n===Add-on===\nAn ''add-on'' or ''addon'' is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like ''[[Minecraft]]'' or ''[[Terraria]]'', or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes (e.g., the [[Airbus A330]] or [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]). This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game's existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game's directory. The ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a .VPK format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.\n\n===Unofficial patch===\nAn ''[[unofficial patch]]'' can be a mod of an existing game that fixes [[Software bug|bugs]] not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game's files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game's fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'' has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19489|accessdate=15 March 2014 |title=JJ2+ (last updated October 30, 2013) |date=2013-11-01}}</ref>  One downside of this type of mod is that leaked content can be revealed.

Art mods are most frequently associated with [[video game art]]. However, modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods (i.e. closer to total conversions) may also be classified as [[art game]]s.<ref name=cannon>Cannon, Rebecca. \"Meltdown\" from ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}</ref> Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience. One example is the ''Velvet-Strike'' mod for ''Counter Strike'' in which the players spray-paint anti-violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of [[performance art]]. Another example is Robert Nideffer's ''Tomb Raider I and II'' patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)#Nude Raider|Nude Raider]]'' patch of the late 1990s by altering Lara Croft's sexual orientation.<ref name=stalker>Stalker, Phillipa Jane.

The term ''[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]'' is often used to make this distinction. \"Vanilla ''[[Battlefield 1942]]''\", for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.\n\nAs early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game. This can include recording in-game actions as a film, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value.

One such example is ''[[Homeworld 2]]'', which requires the program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even [[open-source software|open-source]] modeling programs (such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]]) that can be used as well.\n\nFor advanced mods such as ''[[Desert Combat]]'' that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software is required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.\n\nA game that allows modding is said to be \"moddable\". ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' as well as its predecessors, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. ''[[Daggerfall]]'' was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as ''Gunslingers Academy'' have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. ''[[Supreme Commander (video game)|Supreme Commander]]'' set out to be the 'most customisable game ever' and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe games industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players' contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes(IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.<ref>Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\" in Terry Flew, New Media: an introduction (second edition), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Portability issues===\nFor cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or [[Linux]] ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher's concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'', ported by [[Aspyr]] for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as ''Red Orchestra'' and ''Metaball''.\n\nAlso, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of ''[[Doom 3]]'', are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. [[id Software]]'s Doom 3 Radiant tool and [[Epic Games]]' [[UnrealEd]] are examples of this.\n\nMod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.\n\nThe mod specialist site for Macs, [[Macologist]], has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.\n\n===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===\nIn January 2005, it was reported that in ''[[The Sims 2]]'' (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website's ''exchange'' feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050305070257/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6857 Supernatural powers become contagious in PC game] by Will Knight, NewScientist, 7 January 2005</ref>\n\nAfter the Hot Coffee mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  There is concern about mods which show nudity, and Bestheda does not allow mods with nudity to be uploaded on its website.  Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity if breasts are not visible in the preview image.

This can also include adding revised dialog and music.\n\nExamples of overhaul mods include ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]: Revision'', which was given permission from publisher [[Square Enix]] to release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] alongside the original game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/13/9521011/deus-ex-revision-mod-release-steam|title=A massive overhaul for the original Deus Ex is now available on Steam|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2015-10-13|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V|GTA 5]] Redux'', which not only improves the original game's textures, but also adds a new weather system, visual effects, and adjusts the wanted system, weapons, and vehicle handling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/that-gorgeous-gta-5-graphics-overhaul-mod-is-final/1100-6443721/|title=That Gorgeous GTA 5 Graphics Overhaul Mod Is Finally Available|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2016-09-20|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref>\n\n===Randomizer===\nRandomizers are a type of user mod, typically atop games of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge. Randomizers came out of the [[speedrunning]] community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' around 2015. In the ''Zelda'' randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurely generated manner (similar to [[roguelikes]]) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/what-happens-when-you-randomize-the-legend-of-zelda-1758777271 | title = What Happens When You Randomize The Legend Of Zelda | first=  John  |last =Harris | date= February 2, 2016 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/ | title = How \"randomizers\" are breathing new life into old games | first = Scott | last = White | date = December 3, 2019 | accessdate = December 7, 2019 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\n===Add-on===\nAn ''add-on'' or ''addon'' is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like ''[[Minecraft]]'' or ''[[Terraria]]'', or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes (e.g., the [[Airbus A330]] or [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]). This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game's existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game's directory. The ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a .VPK format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.\n\n===Unofficial patch===\nAn ''[[unofficial patch]]'' can be a mod of an existing game that fixes [[Software bug|bugs]] not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game's files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game's fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit 2]]'' has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz2online.com/jcf/showthread.php?t=19489|accessdate=15 March 2014 |title=JJ2+ (last updated October 30, 2013) |date=2013-11-01}}</ref>  One downside of this type of mod is that leaked content can be revealed.

Art mods are most frequently associated with [[video game art]]. However, modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods (i.e. closer to total conversions) may also be classified as [[art game]]s.<ref name=cannon>Cannon, Rebecca. \"Meltdown\" from ''Videogames and Art'' (Clarke, Andy and Grethe Mitchell, eds.). Bristol: Intellect Books. Pp.40-42. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84150-142-0}}</ref> Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience. One example is the ''Velvet-Strike'' mod for ''Counter Strike'' in which the players spray-paint anti-violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of [[performance art]]. Another example is Robert Nideffer's ''Tomb Raider I and II'' patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)#Nude Raider|Nude Raider]]'' patch of the late 1990s by altering Lara Croft's sexual orientation.<ref name=stalker>Stalker, Phillipa Jane.

According to Brian Winter, policy vice president of the [[Americas Society]]/[[Council of the Americas]], main characteristics of the movement are economic dissatisfaction following the commodities boom and the reliance on military might, with Winter saying that Latin Americans perceive that [[Strongman (politics)|strongman politics]] leads to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> Dr. Lupu of the Latin American Public Opinion Project agreed that as corruption and socioeconomic issues increased in Latin America, citizens turn towards strongmen and distanced themselves from supporting democracy.<ref name=\":3\" /> Winter expressed concern with his assessment of Latin America in 2019, stating \"My fear is that we\u2019ve gone back to the battle days of coups and protests and instability ... I think all of these things play a role and the takeaway could be that we\u2019re returning to a period ... where uprisings and coups and civil unrest were the rule of the day\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHowever, that interpretation of the protests as a sign that Latin American countries are rejecting democracy is far from being common in the Spanish speaking countries, or even clearly majoritarian among scholars in English speaking countries. For many other experts, the main common characteristics of the protests are the opposite to the ones stated in the previous paragraph. This second line of experts claim that the main characteristics of the 2019 Latin American protests are the rejection of the current economic model and a desire to pressure for political reforms to make the governments of the region more democratic and representative, not less. Among other authors in this line, the following can be mentioned. [[Michael Shifter]], president of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], states that what is happening is a \"rebellion against the elites in Latin America\", motivated by a \"widespread sentiment of dissatisfaction and lack of fairness\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shifter|first=Michael|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/opinion/international-world/latin-america-elites-protests.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Rebellion Against the Elites in Latin America|date=2020-01-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Noam Chomsky]] calls the Chilean protests \"very inspiring and very appropriate\", because the \"[[Neoliberalism|Neoliberal]] assault against much of the population of the world pretty much began in Chile\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qy4Df28ohU|title=Chomsky on Chile`s demonstrations|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=Jan 3, 2020|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 3, 2020}}</ref> Salim Vally, professor at the University of Johannesburg, remembers in an article about the role of educator that, though the protests were \"heavily repressed, it did not stop two million people from flooding the streets.

contestation movements since the end of 2018. Some of this protest continued into 2020. \n\nThere are various reasons for the emergence of these waves of protests, but all were anti-governments protests aiming to pressuring leaders to respond to the common concerns of citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latinamericareports.com/2019-a-year-in-protests/3953/|title=2019: A year in protests|last=Jenner|first=Frances|date=2019-12-12|website=Latin America Reports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Protests were triggered by a build-up of perceived antisocial government actions negatively impacting citizens, particularly financially, during a period of austerity following early-2000s prosperity across Latin America. The influence to protest at such large scales has been suggested to come from a widespread fear of economic and social crises caused by government actions, and dissatisfaction at political responses.

According to Brian Winter, policy vice president of the [[Americas Society]]/[[Council of the Americas]], main characteristics of the movement are economic dissatisfaction following the commodities boom and the reliance on military might, with Winter saying that Latin Americans perceive that [[Strongman (politics)|strongman politics]] leads to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> Dr. Lupu of the Latin American Public Opinion Project agreed that as corruption and socioeconomic issues increased in Latin America, citizens turn towards strongmen and distanced themselves from supporting democracy.<ref name=\":3\" /> Winter expressed concern with his assessment of Latin America in 2019, stating \"My fear is that we\u2019ve gone back to the battle days of coups and protests and instability ... I think all of these things play a role and the takeaway could be that we\u2019re returning to a period ... where uprisings and coups and civil unrest were the rule of the day\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHowever, that interpretation of the protests as a sign that Latin American countries are rejecting democracy is far from being common in the Spanish speaking countries, or even clearly majoritarian among scholars in English speaking countries. For many other experts, the main common characteristics of the protests are the opposite to the ones stated in the previous paragraph. This second line of experts claim that the main characteristics of the 2019 Latin American protests are the rejection of the current economic model and a desire to pressure for political reforms to make the governments of the region more democratic and representative, not less. Among other authors in this line, the following can be mentioned. [[Michael Shifter]], president of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], states that what is happening is a \"rebellion against the elites in Latin America\", motivated by a \"widespread sentiment of dissatisfaction and lack of fairness\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shifter|first=Michael|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/opinion/international-world/latin-america-elites-protests.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Rebellion Against the Elites in Latin America|date=2020-01-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Noam Chomsky]] calls the Chilean protests \"very inspiring and very appropriate\", because the \"[[Neoliberalism|Neoliberal]] assault against much of the population of the world pretty much began in Chile\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qy4Df28ohU|title=Chomsky on Chile`s demonstrations|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=Jan 3, 2020|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 3, 2020}}</ref> Salim Vally, professor at the University of Johannesburg, remembers in an article about the role of educator that, though the protests were \"heavily repressed, it did not stop two million people from flooding the streets.

[[Geodynamical]] phenomena include [[crust (geology)|crustal]] motion, [[tide]]s and [[polar motion]], which can be studied by designing global and national [[control networks]], applying [[Space techniques|space]] and terrestrial techniques and relying on [[Geodetic datum|datums]] and [[coordinate system]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe word geodesy comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}} ''geodaisia'' (literally, \"division of Earth\").\n\nIt is primarily concerned with positioning within the [[time|temporally]] varying gravity field. Geodesy in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world is divided into \"higher geodesy\" (\"''Erdmessung''\" or \"''h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring Earth on the global scale, and \"practical geodesy\" or \"engineering geodesy\" (\"''Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring specific parts or regions of Earth, and which includes [[surveying]]. Such geodetic operations are also applied to other astronomical bodies in the [[solar system]]. It is also the science of measuring and understanding Earth's geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field.\n\nTo a large extent, the shape of Earth is the result of [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], which causes its [[equatorial bulge]], and the competition of geological processes such as the [[Continental collision|collision of plates]] and of [[Volcano|volcanism]], resisted by Earth's [[gravity]] field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface ([[dynamic sea surface topography]]) and [[Earth's atmosphere]]. For this reason, the study of Earth's [[gravity field]] is called [[physical geodesy]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of geodesy}}\n\n== Geoid and reference ellipsoid ==\n{{see also|Geoid}}\n\nThe [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of Earth abstracted from its topographical features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of [[sea water]], the [[mean sea level]] surface in the absence of [[Ocean current|currents]] and [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] variations, and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the [[reference ellipsoid]], is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal [[wiktionary:undulate|undulation]]. It varies globally between \u00b1110&nbsp;m, when referred to the GRS&nbsp;80 ellipsoid.\n\nA [[reference ellipsoid]], customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial\nradius) ''a'' and flattening ''f''. The quantity ''f''&nbsp;= {{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''a''}}, where ''b'' is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of Earth (dynamical flattening, symbol ''J''<sub>2</sub>) can be determined to high precision by observation of satellite [[Orbital perturbation analysis|orbit perturbations]]. Its relationship with the geometrical flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution, or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.\n\nThe 1980 Geodetic Reference System ([[GRS80|GRS&nbsp;80]]) posited a 6,378,137&nbsp;m semi-major axis and a 1:298.257 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]]). It is essentially the basis for geodetic positioning by the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and is thus also in widespread use outside the geodetic community. The numerous systems that countries have used to create maps and charts are becoming obsolete as countries increasingly move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS&nbsp;80 reference ellipsoid.\n\nThe geoid is \"realizable\", meaning it can be consistently located on Earth by suitable simple measurements from physical objects like a tide gauge. The geoid can, therefore, be considered a real surface. The reference ellipsoid, however, has many possible instantiations and is not readily realizable, therefore it is an abstract surface. The third primary surface of geodetic interest\u2014the topographic surface of Earth\u2014is a realizable surface.\n\n== Coordinate systems in space ==\n{{see also|Geodetic system}}\n\nThe locations of points in three-dimensional space are most conveniently described by three [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] or rectangular coordinates, ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''. Since the advent of satellite positioning, such coordinate systems are typically [[geocentric]]: the ''Z''-axis is aligned with Earth's (conventional or instantaneous) rotation axis.\n\nPrior to the era of [[satellite geodesy]], the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] attempted to be [[geocentric]], but their origins differed from the geocenter by hundreds of meters, due to regional deviations in the direction of the [[plumbline]] (vertical). These regional geodetic data, such as [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] (European Datum 1950) or [[North American Datum#North American Datum of 1927|NAD&nbsp;27]] (North American Datum 1927) have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional \"best fits\" to the [[geoid]]s within their areas of validity, minimizing the deflections of the vertical over these areas.\n\nIt is only because [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites orbit about the geocenter, that this point becomes naturally the origin of a coordinate system defined by satellite geodetic means, as the satellite positions in space are themselves computed in such a system.\n\nGeocentric coordinate systems used in geodesy can be divided naturally into two classes:\n# [[Inertial]] reference systems, where the coordinate axes retain their orientation relative to the [[fixed star]]s, or equivalently, to the rotation axes of ideal [[gyroscopes]]; the ''X''-axis points to the [[vernal equinox]]\n# Co-rotating, also [[ECEF]] (\"Earth Centred, Earth Fixed\"), where the axes are attached to the solid body of Earth. The ''X''-axis lies within the [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] observatory's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] plane.\n\nThe coordinate transformation between these two systems is described to good approximation by (apparent) [[sidereal time]], which takes into account variations in Earth's axial rotation ([[day|length-of-day]] variations). A more accurate description also takes [[polar motion]] into account, a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.\n\n=== Coordinate systems in the plane ===\n[[File:Litography archive of the Bayerisches Vermessungsamt.jpg|thumb|A [[Munich]] archive with [[lithography]] plates of maps of [[Bavaria]]]]\nIn [[surveying]] and [[map]]ping, important fields of application of geodesy, two general types of coordinate systems are used in the plane:\n\n# Plano-polar, in which points in a plane are defined by a distance ''s'' from a specified point along a ray having a specified direction ''\u03b1'' with respect to a base line or axis;\n# Rectangular, points are defined by distances from two perpendicular axes called ''x'' and ''y''. It is geodetic practice\u2014contrary to the mathematical convention\u2014to let the ''x''-axis point to the north and the ''y''-axis to the east.\n\nRectangular coordinates in the plane can be used intuitively with respect to one's current location, in which case the ''x''-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from three-dimensional coordinates using the artifice of a [[map projection]]. It is ''not'' possible to map the curved surface of Earth onto a flat map surface without deformation. The compromise most often chosen\u2014called a [[conformal projection]]\u2014preserves angles and length ratios, so that small circles are mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.\n\nAn example of such a projection is UTM ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]). Within the map plane, we have rectangular coordinates ''x'' and ''y''. In this case, the north direction used for reference is the ''map'' north, not the ''local'' north. The difference between the two is called [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|meridian convergence]].\n\nIt is easy enough to \"translate\" between polar and rectangular coordinates in the plane: let, as above, direction and distance be ''\u03b1'' and ''s'' respectively, then we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &= s \\cos \\alpha\\\\\ny &= s \\sin \\alpha\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe reverse transformation is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\\n\\alpha &= \\arctan\\frac{y}{x}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Heights ==\nIn geodesy, point or terrain ''[[height]]s'' are \"[[above sea level]]\", an irregular, physically defined surface. \nHeights come in the following variants:\n\n# [[Orthometric height]]s\n# [[Normal height]]s\n# [[Geopotential height]]s\n\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages. Both orthometric and normal heights are heights in metres above sea level, whereas geopotential numbers are measures of potential energy (unit: m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22122</sup>) and not metric. Orthometric and normal heights differ in the precise way in which mean sea level is conceptually continued under the continental masses. The reference surface for orthometric heights is the [[geoid]], an equipotential surface approximating mean sea level.\n\n''None'' of these heights is in any way related to '''geodetic''' or '''ellipsoidial''' heights, which express the height of a point above the [[reference ellipsoid]]. Satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights, unless they are fitted with special conversion software based on a model of the [[geoid]].\n\n== Geodetic data ==\nBecause geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a \"geodetic datum\": a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of ''choosing'' conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.\n\nIn the case of height data, it suffices to choose ''one'' datum point: the reference benchmark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP ([[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]]), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD&nbsp;88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.\n\nIn case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] can be fixed by prescribing the [[undulation of the geoid]] and the deflection of the vertical in ''one'' datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in [[Potsdam]]. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.\n\nChanging the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a ''datum transformation''. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or ''Helmert transformation'', consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a [[Helmert transformation]] has four parameters; in space, seven.\n\n;A note on terminology\n\nIn the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is called a \"coordinate system\" in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] terminology, whereas the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS) uses the term \"reference system\". When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO says \"coordinate reference system\", while IERS says \"reference frame\". The ISO term for a datum transformation again is a \"coordinate transformation\".<ref>(ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).</ref>\n\n== Point positioning ==\n[[File:Geodetic Control Mark.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Geodetic Control Mark (example of a [[Benchmark (surveying)|deep benchmark]])]]\n\nPoint positioning is the determination of the coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space with respect to a coordinate system. Point position is solved by computation from measurements linking the known positions of terrestrial or extraterrestrial points with the unknown terrestrial position. This may involve transformations between or among astronomical and terrestrial coordinate systems. The known points used for point positioning can be [[triangulation]] points of a higher-order network or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites.\n\nTraditionally, a hierarchy of networks has been built to allow point positioning within a country. Highest in the hierarchy were triangulation networks. These were densified into networks of [[traverse (surveying)|traverse]]s ([[polygons]]), into which local mapping surveying measurements, usually with measuring tape, [[Corner reflector|corner prism]], and the familiar{{where?|date=January 2017}} red and white poles, are tied.\n\nNowadays all but special measurements (e.g., underground or high-precision engineering measurements) are performed with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The higher-order networks are measured with [[Global Positioning System|static GPS]], using differential measurement to determine vectors between terrestrial points. These vectors are then adjusted in traditional network fashion. A global polyhedron of permanently operating GPS stations under the auspices of the [[IERS]] is used to define a single global, geocentric reference frame which serves as the \"zero order\" global reference to which national measurements are attached.\n\nFor [[surveying]] mappings, frequently [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS is employed, tying in the unknown points with known terrestrial points close by in real time.\n\nOne purpose of point positioning is the provision of known points for mapping measurements, also known as (horizontal and vertical) control.\nIn every country, thousands of such known points exist and are normally documented by national mapping agencies. Surveyors involved in real estate and insurance will use these to tie their local measurements.\n\n== Geodetic problems ==\n{{Main|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}\n\nIn geometric geodesy, two standard problems exist\u2014the first (direct or forward) and the second (inverse or reverse).\n\n;First (direct or forward) geodetic problem\n\n: Given a point (in terms of its coordinates) and the direction ([[azimuth]]) and [[distance]] from that point to a second point, determine (the coordinates of) that second point.\n\n;Second (inverse or reverse) geodetic problem\n\n: Given two points, determine the azimuth and length of the line (straight line, arc or [[geodesic]]) that connects them.\n\nIn plane geometry (valid for small areas on Earth's surface), the solutions to both problems reduce to simple [[trigonometry]].\nOn a sphere, however, the solution is significantly more complex, because in the inverse problem the azimuths will differ between the two end points of the connecting [[great circle]], arc.\n\nOn the ellipsoid of revolution, geodesics may be written in terms of elliptic integrals, which are usually evaluated in terms of a series expansion\u2014see, for example, [[Vincenty's formulae]]. In the general case, the solution is called the [[geodesic]] for the surface considered. The [[differential equation]]s for the [[geodesic]] can be solved numerically.\n\n== Observational concepts ==\nHere we define some basic observational concepts, like angles and coordinates, defined in geodesy (and [[astronomy]] as well), mostly from the viewpoint of the local observer.\n\n* '''[[Plumbline]]''' or '''vertical''': the direction of local gravity, or the line that results by following it.\n* '''[[Zenith]]''': the point on the [[celestial sphere]] where the direction of the gravity vector in a point, extended upwards, intersects it. It is more correct to call it a '''direction''' rather than a point.\n* '''[[Nadir]]''': the opposite point\u2014or rather, direction\u2014where the direction of gravity extended downward intersects the (obscured) celestial sphere.\n* '''Celestial horizon''': a plane perpendicular to a point's gravity vector.\n* '''[[Azimuth]]''': the direction angle within the plane of the horizon, typically counted clockwise from the north (in geodesy and astronomy) or the south (in France).\n* '''[[Elevation]]''': the angular height of an object above the horizon, Alternatively [[zenith distance]], being equal to 90 degrees minus elevation.\n* '''Local topocentric coordinates''': azimuth (direction angle within the plane of the horizon), elevation angle (or zenith angle), distance.\n* '''North [[celestial pole]]''': the extension of Earth's ([[precession|precessing]] and [[nutation|nutating]]) instantaneous spin axis extended northward to intersect the celestial sphere. (Similarly for the south celestial pole.)\n* '''Celestial equator''': the (instantaneous) intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the celestial sphere.\n* '''[[meridian (geography)|Meridian]] plane''': any plane perpendicular to the celestial equator and containing the celestial poles.\n* '''Local meridian''': the plane containing the direction to the zenith and the direction to the celestial pole.\n\n== Measurements ==\n{{further|Satellite geodesy|Geodetic astronomy|Surveying|Gravimetry|Levelling}}\n\n[[File:Stephen Merkowitz NASA's Space Geodesy Project.ogv|thumb|350px|A NASA project manager talks about his work for the [[Space geodesy|Space Geodesy]] Project, including an overview of its four fundamental techniques: GPS, [[very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]], and [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]].]]\n\nThe level is used for determining height differences and height reference systems, commonly referred to [[mean sea level]]. The traditional [[spirit level]] produces these practically most useful heights above [[sea level]] directly; the more economical use of GPS instruments for height determination requires precise knowledge of the figure of the [[geoid]], as GPS only gives heights above the [[GRS80]] reference ellipsoid. As geoid knowledge accumulates, one may expect the use of GPS heighting to spread.\n\nThe [[theodolite]] is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles to target points. These angles are referred to the local vertical. The [[tacheometer]] additionally determines, electronically or [[Electro-optics|electro-optically]], the distance to target, and is highly automated to even robotic in its operations. The method of [[free station position]] is widely used.\n\nFor local detail surveys, tacheometers are commonly employed although the old-fashioned rectangular technique using angle prism and steel tape is still an inexpensive alternative. Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS techniques are used as well. Data collected are tagged and recorded digitally for entry into a [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) database.\n\nGeodetic [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers produce directly three-dimensional coordinates in a [[geocentric]] coordinate frame. Such a frame is, e.g., [[WGS84]], or the frames that are regularly produced and published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service ([[IERS]]).\n\nGPS receivers have almost completely replaced terrestrial instruments for large-scale base network surveys. For planet-wide geodetic surveys, previously impossible, we can still mention [[satellite laser ranging]] (SLR) and [[lunar laser ranging]] (LLR) and [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI) techniques. All these techniques also serve to monitor irregularities in Earth's rotation as well as plate tectonic motions.\n\n[[Gravity]] is measured using [[gravimeters]], of which there are two kinds. First, \"absolute gravimeters\" are based on measuring the acceleration of [[free fall]] (e.g., of a reflecting prism in a [[vacuum tube]]). They are used to establish the vertical geospatial control and can be used in the field. Second, \"relative gravimeters\" are spring-based and are more common. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. The most accurate relative gravimeters are called \"superconducting\" gravimeters, which are sensitive to one-thousandth of one-billionth of Earth-surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting gravimeters are used worldwide for studying Earth's [[tide]]s, [[rotation]], interior, and [[ocean]] and atmospheric loading, as well as for verifying the Newtonian constant of [[gravitation]].\n\nIn the future, gravity and altitude, will be measured by relativistic [[time dilation]] measured by [[Atomic clock#Strontium optical clocks|strontium optical clocks]].\n\n== Units and measures on the ellipsoid ==\nGeographical [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are ''angles'', not metric\nmeasures, and describe the ''direction'' of the local normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]] of revolution. This is ''approximately'' the same as the direction of the plumbline, i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination \u2013 measuring the direction of the plumbline by astronomical means \u2013 works fairly well provided an ellipsoidal model of the figure of Earth is used.\n\nOne geographical mile, defined as one minute of arc on the equator, equals 1,855.32571922 m. One [[nautical mile]] is one minute of astronomical latitude. The radius of curvature of the ellipsoid varies with latitude, being the longest at the pole and the shortest at the equator as is the nautical mile.\n\nA metre was originally defined as the 10-millionth part of the length from equator to North Pole along the meridian through Paris (the target was not quite reached in actual implementation, so that is off by 200 [[Parts-per notation#ppm|ppm]] in the current definitions). This means that one kilometre is roughly equal to (1/40,000) * 360 * 60 meridional minutes of arc, which equals 0.54 nautical mile, though this is not exact because the two units are defined on different bases (the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 m, corresponding to a rounding of 1,000/0.54 m to four digits).\n\n== Temporal change ==\nIn geodesy, temporal change can be studied by a variety of techniques. Points on Earth's surface change their location due to a variety of mechanisms:\n\n* Continental plate motion, [[plate tectonics]]\n* Episodic motion of tectonic origin, especially close to [[fault line]]s\n* Periodic effects due to tides\n* [[glaciation|Postglacial]] land uplift due to isostatic adjustment\n* Mass variations due to hydrological changes\n* Anthropogenic movements such as reservoir construction or [[petroleum]] or water extraction\n\nThe science of studying deformations and motions of Earth's crust and its solidity as a whole is called [[geodynamics]]. Often, study of Earth's irregular rotation is also included in its definition.\n\nTechniques for studying geodynamic phenomena on the global scale include:\n\n* Satellite positioning by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]\n* [[Very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI)\n* Satellite and lunar [[laser ranging]]\n* Regionally and locally precise levelling\n* Precise tacheometers\n* Monitoring of gravity change\n* [[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (InSAR) using satellite images\n\n== Notable geodesists ==\n=== Mathematical geodesists before 1900 ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Pythagoras]] 580\u2013490&nbsp;BC, [[ancient Greece]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/TR80003A.HTM|title=DEFENSE MAPPING AGENCY TECHNICAL REPORT 80-003|website=Ngs.noaa.gov|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Eratosthenes]] 276\u2013194&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Hipparchus]] {{circa}} 190\u2013120&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Posidonius]] {{circa}} 135\u201351&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Claudius Ptolemy]] {{circa}} AD&nbsp;83\u2013168, [[Roman Empire]] ([[Roman Egypt]])\n* [[Al-Ma'mun]] 786\u2013833, [[Baghdad]] (Iraq/[[Mesopotamia]])\n* [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] 973\u20131048, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] ([[Persia|Iran]]/[[Samanid Dynasty]])\n* [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] 1100\u20131166, ([[Arabia]] & Sicily)\n* [[Regiomontanus]] 1436\u20131476, (Germany/Austria)\n* [[Abel Foullon]] 1513\u20131563 or 1565, (France)\n* [[Pedro Nunes]] 1502\u20131578 (Portugal)\n* [[Gerardus Mercator|Gerhard Mercator]] 1512\u20131594 (Belgium & Germany)\n* [[Willebrord Snellius|Snellius]] (Willebrord Snel van Royen) 1580\u20131626, [[Leiden]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Christiaan Huygens]] 1629\u20131695 (Netherlands)\n* [[Pierre Bouguer]] 1698\u20131758, (France & Peru)\n* [[Pierre de Maupertuis]] 1698\u20131759 (France)\n* [[Alexis Clairaut]] 1713\u20131765 (France)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] 1728\u20131777 (France)\n* [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] 1711\u20131787, ([[Rome]]/ [[Berlin]]/ [[Paris]])\n* [[Ino Tadataka]] 1745\u20131818, ([[Tokyo]])\n* [[Georg von Reichenbach]] 1771\u20131826, [[Bavaria]] (Germany)\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] 1749\u20131827, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Adrien Marie Legendre]] 1752\u20131833, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] 1776\u20131833, [[Munich]] (Germany)\n* [[George Everest]] 1790\u20131866 (England and India)\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] 1784\u20131846, [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (Germany)\n* [[Heinrich Christian Schumacher]] 1780\u20131850 (Germany & Russian Empire)\n* [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] 1777\u20131855, G\u00f6ttingen (Germany)\n* [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] 1793\u20131864, [[Tartu Observatory|Dorpat]] and [[Pulkovo Observatory|Pulkovo]] ([[Russian Empire]])\n* [[J.

[[Geodynamical]] phenomena include [[crust (geology)|crustal]] motion, [[tide]]s and [[polar motion]], which can be studied by designing global and national [[control networks]], applying [[Space techniques|space]] and terrestrial techniques and relying on [[Geodetic datum|datums]] and [[coordinate system]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe word geodesy comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}} ''geodaisia'' (literally, \"division of Earth\").\n\nIt is primarily concerned with positioning within the [[time|temporally]] varying gravity field. Geodesy in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world is divided into \"higher geodesy\" (\"''Erdmessung''\" or \"''h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring Earth on the global scale, and \"practical geodesy\" or \"engineering geodesy\" (\"''Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie''\"), which is concerned with measuring specific parts or regions of Earth, and which includes [[surveying]]. Such geodetic operations are also applied to other astronomical bodies in the [[solar system]]. It is also the science of measuring and understanding Earth's geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field.\n\nTo a large extent, the shape of Earth is the result of [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], which causes its [[equatorial bulge]], and the competition of geological processes such as the [[Continental collision|collision of plates]] and of [[Volcano|volcanism]], resisted by Earth's [[gravity]] field. This applies to the solid surface, the liquid surface ([[dynamic sea surface topography]]) and [[Earth's atmosphere]]. For this reason, the study of Earth's [[gravity field]] is called [[physical geodesy]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of geodesy}}\n\n== Geoid and reference ellipsoid ==\n{{see also|Geoid}}\n\nThe [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of Earth abstracted from its topographical features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of [[sea water]], the [[mean sea level]] surface in the absence of [[Ocean current|currents]] and [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] variations, and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the [[reference ellipsoid]], is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal [[wiktionary:undulate|undulation]]. It varies globally between \u00b1110&nbsp;m, when referred to the GRS&nbsp;80 ellipsoid.\n\nA [[reference ellipsoid]], customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial\nradius) ''a'' and flattening ''f''. The quantity ''f''&nbsp;= {{sfrac|''a'' \u2212 ''b''|''a''}}, where ''b'' is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of Earth (dynamical flattening, symbol ''J''<sub>2</sub>) can be determined to high precision by observation of satellite [[Orbital perturbation analysis|orbit perturbations]]. Its relationship with the geometrical flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution, or, in simplest terms, the degree of central concentration of mass.\n\nThe 1980 Geodetic Reference System ([[GRS80|GRS&nbsp;80]]) posited a 6,378,137&nbsp;m semi-major axis and a 1:298.257 flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]]). It is essentially the basis for geodetic positioning by the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and is thus also in widespread use outside the geodetic community. The numerous systems that countries have used to create maps and charts are becoming obsolete as countries increasingly move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS&nbsp;80 reference ellipsoid.\n\nThe geoid is \"realizable\", meaning it can be consistently located on Earth by suitable simple measurements from physical objects like a tide gauge. The geoid can, therefore, be considered a real surface. The reference ellipsoid, however, has many possible instantiations and is not readily realizable, therefore it is an abstract surface. The third primary surface of geodetic interest\u2014the topographic surface of Earth\u2014is a realizable surface.\n\n== Coordinate systems in space ==\n{{see also|Geodetic system}}\n\nThe locations of points in three-dimensional space are most conveniently described by three [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] or rectangular coordinates, ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''. Since the advent of satellite positioning, such coordinate systems are typically [[geocentric]]: the ''Z''-axis is aligned with Earth's (conventional or instantaneous) rotation axis.\n\nPrior to the era of [[satellite geodesy]], the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] attempted to be [[geocentric]], but their origins differed from the geocenter by hundreds of meters, due to regional deviations in the direction of the [[plumbline]] (vertical). These regional geodetic data, such as [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] (European Datum 1950) or [[North American Datum#North American Datum of 1927|NAD&nbsp;27]] (North American Datum 1927) have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional \"best fits\" to the [[geoid]]s within their areas of validity, minimizing the deflections of the vertical over these areas.\n\nIt is only because [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites orbit about the geocenter, that this point becomes naturally the origin of a coordinate system defined by satellite geodetic means, as the satellite positions in space are themselves computed in such a system.\n\nGeocentric coordinate systems used in geodesy can be divided naturally into two classes:\n# [[Inertial]] reference systems, where the coordinate axes retain their orientation relative to the [[fixed star]]s, or equivalently, to the rotation axes of ideal [[gyroscopes]]; the ''X''-axis points to the [[vernal equinox]]\n# Co-rotating, also [[ECEF]] (\"Earth Centred, Earth Fixed\"), where the axes are attached to the solid body of Earth. The ''X''-axis lies within the [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] observatory's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] plane.\n\nThe coordinate transformation between these two systems is described to good approximation by (apparent) [[sidereal time]], which takes into account variations in Earth's axial rotation ([[day|length-of-day]] variations). A more accurate description also takes [[polar motion]] into account, a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.\n\n=== Coordinate systems in the plane ===\n[[File:Litography archive of the Bayerisches Vermessungsamt.jpg|thumb|A [[Munich]] archive with [[lithography]] plates of maps of [[Bavaria]]]]\nIn [[surveying]] and [[map]]ping, important fields of application of geodesy, two general types of coordinate systems are used in the plane:\n\n# Plano-polar, in which points in a plane are defined by a distance ''s'' from a specified point along a ray having a specified direction ''\u03b1'' with respect to a base line or axis;\n# Rectangular, points are defined by distances from two perpendicular axes called ''x'' and ''y''. It is geodetic practice\u2014contrary to the mathematical convention\u2014to let the ''x''-axis point to the north and the ''y''-axis to the east.\n\nRectangular coordinates in the plane can be used intuitively with respect to one's current location, in which case the ''x''-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from three-dimensional coordinates using the artifice of a [[map projection]]. It is ''not'' possible to map the curved surface of Earth onto a flat map surface without deformation. The compromise most often chosen\u2014called a [[conformal projection]]\u2014preserves angles and length ratios, so that small circles are mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.\n\nAn example of such a projection is UTM ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]). Within the map plane, we have rectangular coordinates ''x'' and ''y''. In this case, the north direction used for reference is the ''map'' north, not the ''local'' north. The difference between the two is called [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|meridian convergence]].\n\nIt is easy enough to \"translate\" between polar and rectangular coordinates in the plane: let, as above, direction and distance be ''\u03b1'' and ''s'' respectively, then we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &= s \\cos \\alpha\\\\\ny &= s \\sin \\alpha\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe reverse transformation is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\\n\\alpha &= \\arctan\\frac{y}{x}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Heights ==\nIn geodesy, point or terrain ''[[height]]s'' are \"[[above sea level]]\", an irregular, physically defined surface. \nHeights come in the following variants:\n\n# [[Orthometric height]]s\n# [[Normal height]]s\n# [[Geopotential height]]s\n\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages. Both orthometric and normal heights are heights in metres above sea level, whereas geopotential numbers are measures of potential energy (unit: m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22122</sup>) and not metric. Orthometric and normal heights differ in the precise way in which mean sea level is conceptually continued under the continental masses. The reference surface for orthometric heights is the [[geoid]], an equipotential surface approximating mean sea level.\n\n''None'' of these heights is in any way related to '''geodetic''' or '''ellipsoidial''' heights, which express the height of a point above the [[reference ellipsoid]]. Satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights, unless they are fitted with special conversion software based on a model of the [[geoid]].\n\n== Geodetic data ==\nBecause geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a \"geodetic datum\": a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of ''choosing'' conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.\n\nIn the case of height data, it suffices to choose ''one'' datum point: the reference benchmark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP ([[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]]), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD&nbsp;88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.\n\nIn case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like [[ED50|ED&nbsp;50]] can be fixed by prescribing the [[undulation of the geoid]] and the deflection of the vertical in ''one'' datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in [[Potsdam]]. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.\n\nChanging the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a ''datum transformation''. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or ''Helmert transformation'', consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a [[Helmert transformation]] has four parameters; in space, seven.\n\n;A note on terminology\n\nIn the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is called a \"coordinate system\" in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] terminology, whereas the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS) uses the term \"reference system\". When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO says \"coordinate reference system\", while IERS says \"reference frame\". The ISO term for a datum transformation again is a \"coordinate transformation\".<ref>(ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).</ref>\n\n== Point positioning ==\n[[File:Geodetic Control Mark.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Geodetic Control Mark (example of a [[Benchmark (surveying)|deep benchmark]])]]\n\nPoint positioning is the determination of the coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space with respect to a coordinate system. Point position is solved by computation from measurements linking the known positions of terrestrial or extraterrestrial points with the unknown terrestrial position. This may involve transformations between or among astronomical and terrestrial coordinate systems. The known points used for point positioning can be [[triangulation]] points of a higher-order network or [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites.\n\nTraditionally, a hierarchy of networks has been built to allow point positioning within a country. Highest in the hierarchy were triangulation networks. These were densified into networks of [[traverse (surveying)|traverse]]s ([[polygons]]), into which local mapping surveying measurements, usually with measuring tape, [[Corner reflector|corner prism]], and the familiar{{where?|date=January 2017}} red and white poles, are tied.\n\nNowadays all but special measurements (e.g., underground or high-precision engineering measurements) are performed with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The higher-order networks are measured with [[Global Positioning System|static GPS]], using differential measurement to determine vectors between terrestrial points. These vectors are then adjusted in traditional network fashion. A global polyhedron of permanently operating GPS stations under the auspices of the [[IERS]] is used to define a single global, geocentric reference frame which serves as the \"zero order\" global reference to which national measurements are attached.\n\nFor [[surveying]] mappings, frequently [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS is employed, tying in the unknown points with known terrestrial points close by in real time.\n\nOne purpose of point positioning is the provision of known points for mapping measurements, also known as (horizontal and vertical) control.\nIn every country, thousands of such known points exist and are normally documented by national mapping agencies. Surveyors involved in real estate and insurance will use these to tie their local measurements.\n\n== Geodetic problems ==\n{{Main|Geodesics on an ellipsoid}}\n\nIn geometric geodesy, two standard problems exist\u2014the first (direct or forward) and the second (inverse or reverse).\n\n;First (direct or forward) geodetic problem\n\n: Given a point (in terms of its coordinates) and the direction ([[azimuth]]) and [[distance]] from that point to a second point, determine (the coordinates of) that second point.\n\n;Second (inverse or reverse) geodetic problem\n\n: Given two points, determine the azimuth and length of the line (straight line, arc or [[geodesic]]) that connects them.\n\nIn plane geometry (valid for small areas on Earth's surface), the solutions to both problems reduce to simple [[trigonometry]].\nOn a sphere, however, the solution is significantly more complex, because in the inverse problem the azimuths will differ between the two end points of the connecting [[great circle]], arc.\n\nOn the ellipsoid of revolution, geodesics may be written in terms of elliptic integrals, which are usually evaluated in terms of a series expansion\u2014see, for example, [[Vincenty's formulae]]. In the general case, the solution is called the [[geodesic]] for the surface considered. The [[differential equation]]s for the [[geodesic]] can be solved numerically.\n\n== Observational concepts ==\nHere we define some basic observational concepts, like angles and coordinates, defined in geodesy (and [[astronomy]] as well), mostly from the viewpoint of the local observer.\n\n* '''[[Plumbline]]''' or '''vertical''': the direction of local gravity, or the line that results by following it.\n* '''[[Zenith]]''': the point on the [[celestial sphere]] where the direction of the gravity vector in a point, extended upwards, intersects it. It is more correct to call it a '''direction''' rather than a point.\n* '''[[Nadir]]''': the opposite point\u2014or rather, direction\u2014where the direction of gravity extended downward intersects the (obscured) celestial sphere.\n* '''Celestial horizon''': a plane perpendicular to a point's gravity vector.\n* '''[[Azimuth]]''': the direction angle within the plane of the horizon, typically counted clockwise from the north (in geodesy and astronomy) or the south (in France).\n* '''[[Elevation]]''': the angular height of an object above the horizon, Alternatively [[zenith distance]], being equal to 90 degrees minus elevation.\n* '''Local topocentric coordinates''': azimuth (direction angle within the plane of the horizon), elevation angle (or zenith angle), distance.\n* '''North [[celestial pole]]''': the extension of Earth's ([[precession|precessing]] and [[nutation|nutating]]) instantaneous spin axis extended northward to intersect the celestial sphere. (Similarly for the south celestial pole.)\n* '''Celestial equator''': the (instantaneous) intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the celestial sphere.\n* '''[[meridian (geography)|Meridian]] plane''': any plane perpendicular to the celestial equator and containing the celestial poles.\n* '''Local meridian''': the plane containing the direction to the zenith and the direction to the celestial pole.\n\n== Measurements ==\n{{further|Satellite geodesy|Geodetic astronomy|Surveying|Gravimetry|Levelling}}\n\n[[File:Stephen Merkowitz NASA's Space Geodesy Project.ogv|thumb|350px|A NASA project manager talks about his work for the [[Space geodesy|Space Geodesy]] Project, including an overview of its four fundamental techniques: GPS, [[very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]], [[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]], and [[DORIS (geodesy)|DORIS]].]]\n\nThe level is used for determining height differences and height reference systems, commonly referred to [[mean sea level]]. The traditional [[spirit level]] produces these practically most useful heights above [[sea level]] directly; the more economical use of GPS instruments for height determination requires precise knowledge of the figure of the [[geoid]], as GPS only gives heights above the [[GRS80]] reference ellipsoid. As geoid knowledge accumulates, one may expect the use of GPS heighting to spread.\n\nThe [[theodolite]] is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles to target points. These angles are referred to the local vertical. The [[tacheometer]] additionally determines, electronically or [[Electro-optics|electro-optically]], the distance to target, and is highly automated to even robotic in its operations. The method of [[free station position]] is widely used.\n\nFor local detail surveys, tacheometers are commonly employed although the old-fashioned rectangular technique using angle prism and steel tape is still an inexpensive alternative. Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS techniques are used as well. Data collected are tagged and recorded digitally for entry into a [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) database.\n\nGeodetic [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers produce directly three-dimensional coordinates in a [[geocentric]] coordinate frame. Such a frame is, e.g., [[WGS84]], or the frames that are regularly produced and published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service ([[IERS]]).\n\nGPS receivers have almost completely replaced terrestrial instruments for large-scale base network surveys. For planet-wide geodetic surveys, previously impossible, we can still mention [[satellite laser ranging]] (SLR) and [[lunar laser ranging]] (LLR) and [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI) techniques. All these techniques also serve to monitor irregularities in Earth's rotation as well as plate tectonic motions.\n\n[[Gravity]] is measured using [[gravimeters]], of which there are two kinds. First, \"absolute gravimeters\" are based on measuring the acceleration of [[free fall]] (e.g., of a reflecting prism in a [[vacuum tube]]). They are used to establish the vertical geospatial control and can be used in the field. Second, \"relative gravimeters\" are spring-based and are more common. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. The most accurate relative gravimeters are called \"superconducting\" gravimeters, which are sensitive to one-thousandth of one-billionth of Earth-surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting gravimeters are used worldwide for studying Earth's [[tide]]s, [[rotation]], interior, and [[ocean]] and atmospheric loading, as well as for verifying the Newtonian constant of [[gravitation]].\n\nIn the future, gravity and altitude, will be measured by relativistic [[time dilation]] measured by [[Atomic clock#Strontium optical clocks|strontium optical clocks]].\n\n== Units and measures on the ellipsoid ==\nGeographical [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are ''angles'', not metric\nmeasures, and describe the ''direction'' of the local normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]] of revolution. This is ''approximately'' the same as the direction of the plumbline, i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination \u2013 measuring the direction of the plumbline by astronomical means \u2013 works fairly well provided an ellipsoidal model of the figure of Earth is used.\n\nOne geographical mile, defined as one minute of arc on the equator, equals 1,855.32571922 m. One [[nautical mile]] is one minute of astronomical latitude. The radius of curvature of the ellipsoid varies with latitude, being the longest at the pole and the shortest at the equator as is the nautical mile.\n\nA metre was originally defined as the 10-millionth part of the length from equator to North Pole along the meridian through Paris (the target was not quite reached in actual implementation, so that is off by 200 [[Parts-per notation#ppm|ppm]] in the current definitions). This means that one kilometre is roughly equal to (1/40,000) * 360 * 60 meridional minutes of arc, which equals 0.54 nautical mile, though this is not exact because the two units are defined on different bases (the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 m, corresponding to a rounding of 1,000/0.54 m to four digits).\n\n== Temporal change ==\nIn geodesy, temporal change can be studied by a variety of techniques. Points on Earth's surface change their location due to a variety of mechanisms:\n\n* Continental plate motion, [[plate tectonics]]\n* Episodic motion of tectonic origin, especially close to [[fault line]]s\n* Periodic effects due to tides\n* [[glaciation|Postglacial]] land uplift due to isostatic adjustment\n* Mass variations due to hydrological changes\n* Anthropogenic movements such as reservoir construction or [[petroleum]] or water extraction\n\nThe science of studying deformations and motions of Earth's crust and its solidity as a whole is called [[geodynamics]]. Often, study of Earth's irregular rotation is also included in its definition.\n\nTechniques for studying geodynamic phenomena on the global scale include:\n\n* Satellite positioning by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]\n* [[Very-long-baseline interferometry]] (VLBI)\n* Satellite and lunar [[laser ranging]]\n* Regionally and locally precise levelling\n* Precise tacheometers\n* Monitoring of gravity change\n* [[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (InSAR) using satellite images\n\n== Notable geodesists ==\n=== Mathematical geodesists before 1900 ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Pythagoras]] 580\u2013490&nbsp;BC, [[ancient Greece]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/TR80003A.HTM|title=DEFENSE MAPPING AGENCY TECHNICAL REPORT 80-003|website=Ngs.noaa.gov|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Eratosthenes]] 276\u2013194&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Hipparchus]] {{circa}} 190\u2013120&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Posidonius]] {{circa}} 135\u201351&nbsp;BC, ancient Greece\n* [[Claudius Ptolemy]] {{circa}} AD&nbsp;83\u2013168, [[Roman Empire]] ([[Roman Egypt]])\n* [[Al-Ma'mun]] 786\u2013833, [[Baghdad]] (Iraq/[[Mesopotamia]])\n* [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] 973\u20131048, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] ([[Persia|Iran]]/[[Samanid Dynasty]])\n* [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] 1100\u20131166, ([[Arabia]] & Sicily)\n* [[Regiomontanus]] 1436\u20131476, (Germany/Austria)\n* [[Abel Foullon]] 1513\u20131563 or 1565, (France)\n* [[Pedro Nunes]] 1502\u20131578 (Portugal)\n* [[Gerardus Mercator|Gerhard Mercator]] 1512\u20131594 (Belgium & Germany)\n* [[Willebrord Snellius|Snellius]] (Willebrord Snel van Royen) 1580\u20131626, [[Leiden]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Christiaan Huygens]] 1629\u20131695 (Netherlands)\n* [[Pierre Bouguer]] 1698\u20131758, (France & Peru)\n* [[Pierre de Maupertuis]] 1698\u20131759 (France)\n* [[Alexis Clairaut]] 1713\u20131765 (France)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] 1728\u20131777 (France)\n* [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] 1711\u20131787, ([[Rome]]/ [[Berlin]]/ [[Paris]])\n* [[Ino Tadataka]] 1745\u20131818, ([[Tokyo]])\n* [[Georg von Reichenbach]] 1771\u20131826, [[Bavaria]] (Germany)\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] 1749\u20131827, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Adrien Marie Legendre]] 1752\u20131833, [[Paris]] (France)\n* [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] 1776\u20131833, [[Munich]] (Germany)\n* [[George Everest]] 1790\u20131866 (England and India)\n* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] 1784\u20131846, [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (Germany)\n* [[Heinrich Christian Schumacher]] 1780\u20131850 (Germany & Russian Empire)\n* [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] 1777\u20131855, G\u00f6ttingen (Germany)\n* [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] 1793\u20131864, [[Tartu Observatory|Dorpat]] and [[Pulkovo Observatory|Pulkovo]] ([[Russian Empire]])\n* [[J.

Under the protection and auspices of the regime in Washington millions of people came to celebrate the ideals of global [[socialism]]. Multinational corporations spent billions of dollars, and Washington organized an army of security to protect these best of all games. Even though the conception and the purpose of the so-called Olympic movement is to promote the values of global socialism as perfectly expressed in the song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" by [[John Lennon]], which was the theme of the 1996 Games\u2014even though the purpose of the Olympics is to promote these ideals, the purpose of the attack on July 27 was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.\n\nThe plan was to force the cancellation of the games, or at least create a state of insecurity in order to empty the streets around the venues and thereby eat into the vast amounts of money that had been invested in them.<ref name=\"fulltext\"/></blockquote>\n\nRudolph's statement cleared [[Richard Jewell]], a Centennial Olympic Park security guard, of any involvement in the bombing. Despite having been initially hailed as a hero for being the first one to spot Rudolph's explosive device and helping to clear the area, Jewell came under FBI suspicion for his alleged involvement in the crime, and as a result, he became the prime suspect and an international news story.\n\nRudolph has also confessed to three other bombings: the bombing of an [[abortion clinic]] in the Atlanta suburb of [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]] on January 16, 1997; the bombing of the Otherside Lounge of Atlanta, a [[gay bar|lesbian bar]], on February 21, 1997, injuring five;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130414003813/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/April/05_crm_176.htm Eric Robert Rudolph To Plead Guilty To Serial Bombing Attacks In Atlanta And Birmingham; Will Receive Life Sentences] April 8, 2005</ref> and the bombing of an abortion clinic in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on January 29, 1998, killing [[Birmingham Police Department (Alabama)|Birmingham police officer]] Robert Sanderson who was working off-duty in uniform, and critically injuring nurse [[Emily Lyons]].

Under the protection and auspices of the regime in Washington millions of people came to celebrate the ideals of global [[socialism]]. Multinational corporations spent billions of dollars, and Washington organized an army of security to protect these best of all games. Even though the conception and the purpose of the so-called Olympic movement is to promote the values of global socialism as perfectly expressed in the song \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" by [[John Lennon]], which was the theme of the 1996 Games\u2014even though the purpose of the Olympics is to promote these ideals, the purpose of the attack on July 27 was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.\n\nThe plan was to force the cancellation of the games, or at least create a state of insecurity in order to empty the streets around the venues and thereby eat into the vast amounts of money that had been invested in them.<ref name=\"fulltext\"/></blockquote>\n\nRudolph's statement cleared [[Richard Jewell]], a Centennial Olympic Park security guard, of any involvement in the bombing. Despite having been initially hailed as a hero for being the first one to spot Rudolph's explosive device and helping to clear the area, Jewell came under FBI suspicion for his alleged involvement in the crime, and as a result, he became the prime suspect and an international news story.\n\nRudolph has also confessed to three other bombings: the bombing of an [[abortion clinic]] in the Atlanta suburb of [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]] on January 16, 1997; the bombing of the Otherside Lounge of Atlanta, a [[gay bar|lesbian bar]], on February 21, 1997, injuring five;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130414003813/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/April/05_crm_176.htm Eric Robert Rudolph To Plead Guilty To Serial Bombing Attacks In Atlanta And Birmingham; Will Receive Life Sentences] April 8, 2005</ref> and the bombing of an abortion clinic in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on January 29, 1998, killing [[Birmingham Police Department (Alabama)|Birmingham police officer]] Robert Sanderson who was working off-duty in uniform, and critically injuring nurse [[Emily Lyons]].

The Corsair had unusual and quite bold styling for its day, with a sharp horizontal V-shaped crease at the very front of the car into which round headlights were inset.

Initially, Hamburg decided not to let him go as the Olympics was not an official FIFA tournament. After a dispute, Hamburg decided to release him under the condition that he returned after Belgium's first two group games. At the Beijing Olympics, Belgium's first game was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] where he was sent off in a 1\u20130 loss, and as a consequence his tournament was over as the red card would rule him out of Belgium's second group game. Due to the turn of events, Kompany decided against returning to Germany in hope of playing the last group game to help his country qualify for the knockout stages. Hamburg maintained their stance that he had to return, and the Belgian FA decided to release him. He later came on as a substitute in the opening game for Hamburg against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. The rocky relationship with Hamburg and Kompany is said to be a major factor in him transferring to Manchester City.\n\nIn November 2009, Kompany fell out with the Belgium manager [[Dick Advocaat]].  On the Monday before the friendly match with [[Qatar]] on 18 November 2009, Kompany received permission to attend the funeral of his grandmother as long as he returned to the team hotel before 6&nbsp;pm that evening.

Initially, Hamburg decided not to let him go as the Olympics was not an official FIFA tournament. After a dispute, Hamburg decided to release him under the condition that he returned after Belgium's first two group games. At the Beijing Olympics, Belgium's first game was against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] where he was sent off in a 1\u20130 loss, and as a consequence his tournament was over as the red card would rule him out of Belgium's second group game. Due to the turn of events, Kompany decided against returning to Germany in hope of playing the last group game to help his country qualify for the knockout stages. Hamburg maintained their stance that he had to return, and the Belgian FA decided to release him. He later came on as a substitute in the opening game for Hamburg against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. The rocky relationship with Hamburg and Kompany is said to be a major factor in him transferring to Manchester City.\n\nIn November 2009, Kompany fell out with the Belgium manager [[Dick Advocaat]].  On the Monday before the friendly match with [[Qatar]] on 18 November 2009, Kompany received permission to attend the funeral of his grandmother as long as he returned to the team hotel before 6&nbsp;pm that evening. As it happened, he did not return until nearly midnight. Furious, Advocaat removed him from the squad altogether, although on 24 February 2010 he was recalled to the Belgium squad by Advocaat for the friendly against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Romelu Lukaku est officiellement Diable Rouge |url=http://www.dhnet.be/sports/diables-rouges/article/301782/romelu-lukaku-est-officiellement-diable-rouge.html |language=French |newspaper=La Derni\u00e8re Heure |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clint Dempsey and Vincent Kompany exchange pennants USA vs Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|Belgian captain Kompany swaps pennants with [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]' skipper [[Clint Dempsey]] in 2013]]\n\nOn 19 May 2010, Kompany scored a 90th-minute goal to give Belgium a 2\u20131 win over [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in a friendly.
