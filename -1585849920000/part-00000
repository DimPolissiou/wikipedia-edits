His later work includes the presentation of ''Strictly Come Dancing'' and his own talk show ''Pulse''.\n\nIn 2001, Oerlemans founded his own production company, Eyeworks, with partners Robert van den Bogaard and Ronald van Wechem.

{"title_page": "Punched tape", "text_new": "[[File:PaperTapes-5and8Hole.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Five- and eight-hole punched paper tape]]\n[[File:Harwell-dekatron-witch-10.jpg|right|thumb|Paper tape reader on an [[Harwell computer|early computer]] with a small piece of five-hole tape connected in a circle \u2013 creating a physical program loop]]\n\n'''Punched tape''' or '''perforated paper tape''' is a form of [[data storage device|data storage]] that consists of a long strip of paper in which holes are punched. Now effectively obsolete, it was widely used during much of the 20th century for [[teleprinter]] communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for [[minicomputer]]s and [[CNC machine tool]]s.\n\n==Origin==\n\n[[File:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|thumb|right|A paper tape, constructed from [[punched card]]s, in use in a [[Jacquard loom]]. The large holes on each edge are [[sprocket]] holes, used to pull the paper tape through the loom.]]\n\nPaper tapes constructed from punched cards were widely used throughout the 19th century for controlling looms. Perforated paper tapes were first used by [[Basile Bouchon]] in 1725 to control looms. However, the paper tapes were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] had developed machines to create paper tapes by tying punched cards in a sequence for [[Jacquard loom]]s. The resulting paper tape, also called a \"chain of cards\", was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair.\n\nThis led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but as one \"continuous card\" (or tape). Many professional [[embroidery]] operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as \"punchers\" even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out in the 1990s. In 1842, a French patent by Claude Seytre described a [[Player piano|piano playing device]] that read data from [[Piano roll|perforated paper rolls]].\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] used punched tape to send [[telegrams]]. This technology was adopted by [[Charles Wheatstone]] in 1857 for the [[Wheatstone system|preparation, storage and transmission of data]] in telegraphy.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Clive |last=Maxfield |title=How it was: Paper tapes and punched cards |date=13 October 2011 |magazine=EE Times |url=http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?doc_id=1285484}}</ref>\n\nIn 1880s, [[Tolbert Lanston]] invented the [[Monotype System]], which consisted of a keyboard (typesetting machine) and a composition [[Casting (metalworking)|caster]]. The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in 0, 1, or more of 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.\n\n==Tape formats==\n[[File:Harvard Mark I program tape.agr.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A 24-channel program tape for the [[Harvard Mark I]] ]]\n\nData were represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical programmable calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or [[Harvard Mark I]], used paper tape with 24 rows.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Dalakov | first = Georgi | title = History of computers: The MARK computers of Howard Aiken | url = http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Relays/Aiken.html | accessdate = 2011-01-12 }}</ref> A row of smaller sprocket holes that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a [[sprocket|sprocket wheel]]. Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the [[Least significant bit|least significant bits]], when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nText was encoded in several ways. The earliest standard [[character encoding]] was [[Baudot code|Baudot]], which dates back to the 19th century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the [[Baudot code#Murray code|Murray code]] (which added [[carriage return]] and [[line feed]]), [[Western Union code]], [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA 2), and [[American Teletypewriter code]] (USTTY), were used.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.co.com/books?id=q_yq7zvehjoC&pg=PA136\n|title=Technical Handbook for Radio Monitoring HF: Edition 2009\n|last=Proesch\n|first=Roland\n|year=2009\n|publisher=Books on Demand\n|isbn=3837045730\n}}\n</ref> Other standards, such as [[Teletypesetter]] (TTS), [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], had six holes. In the early 1960s, the [[American Standards Association]] led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as [[ASCII]]. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] ([[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]]). Others, such as [[teleprinter|Telex]], stayed with the earlier codes.\n\n===Dimensions===\nTape for punching was 0.00394 inches (0.1&nbsp;mm) thick. The two most common widths were 11/16 inch (17.46&nbsp;mm) for five bit codes, and 1 inch (25.4&nbsp;mm) for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was 0.1 inch (2.54&nbsp;mm) in both directions. Data holes were 0.072 inches (1.83&nbsp;mm) in diameter; feed holes were 0.046 inches (1.17&nbsp;mm).\n\n===Chadless tape===\nMost tape-punching equipment used solid punches to create holes in the tape. This process created \"[[chad (paper)|chad]]\", or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment.\n\n[[File:1980-Paper Tape fromTeletype (chadless, 5-level Baudot)-02.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chadless paper tape|Chadless 5-level Baudot paper tape circa ~1975\u20131980 punched at Teletype Corp.]]\nA variation on the tape punch was a device called a ''Chadless Printing Reperforator''. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no [[chad (paper)|chad]] would be produced; the \"hole\" was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, there was no \"chad box\" to empty from time to time.

The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for \"Automatic Send/Receive\" as opposed to the punchless/readerless KSR \u2013 [[Keyboard Send Receive|Keyboard Send/Receive]] and RO \u2013 Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low-cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.\n\nBinary data transfer to or from these [[minicomputer]]s was often accomplished using a doubly encoded technique to compensate for the relatively high error rate of punches and readers. The low-level encoding was typically ASCII, further encoded and framed in various schemes such as [[Intel Hex]], in which a binary value of \"01011010\" would be represented by the ASCII characters \"5A\". Framing, addressing and [[checksum]] (primarily in ASCII hex characters) information helped with error detection. Efficiencies of such an encoding scheme are on the order of 35\u201340% (e.g., 36% from 44 8-bit ASCII characters being needed to represent sixteen [[byte]]s of binary data per frame).\n<!--{{clear}}-->\n\n===Data transfer for ROM and EPROM programming===\nIn the 1970s through the early 1980s, paper tape was commonly used to transfer binary data for incorporation in either mask-programmable [[Read-only memory|read-only memory (ROM)]] chips or their erasable counterparts \u2013 [[EPROM]]s. A significant variety of encoding formats were developed for use in computer and ROM/EPROM data transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dataio.com/main/Manuals/UniFam/Translation%20Formats.pdf |title=Translation File Formats |publisher=Data I/O Corporation |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> Encoding formats commonly used were primarily driven by those formats that EPROM programming devices supported and included various ASCII hex variants as well as a number of proprietary formats.\n\nA much more primitive as well as a much longer high-level encoding scheme was also used \u2013 [[BNPF]] (Begin-Negative-Positive-Finish). In BNPF encoding, a single [[byte]] (8 bits) would be represented by a highly redundant character framing sequence starting with a single ASCII \"B\", eight ASCII characters where a \"0\" would be represented by a \"N\" and a \"1\" would be represented by a \"P\", followed by an ending ASCII \"F\". These ten-character ASCII sequences were separated by one or more [[whitespace character]]s, therefore using at least eleven ASCII characters for each byte stored (9% efficiency). The ASCII \"N\" and \"P\" characters differ in four bit positions, providing excellent protection from single punch errors. Alternative schemes were also available where \"L\" and \"H\" or \"0\" and \"1\" were also available to represent data bits, but in both of these encoding schemes, the two data-bearing ASCII characters differ in only one bit position, providing very poor single punch error detection.\n\n===Cash registers===\n[[NCR Corporation|NCR]] of [[Dayton, Ohio]], made cash registers around 1970 that would punch paper tape. [[Sweda]] made similar cash registers around the same time. The tape could then be read into a computer and not only could sales information be summarized, billings could be done on charge transactions. The tape was also used for inventory tracking, recording department and class numbers of items sold.\n\n===Newspaper industry===\nPunched paper tape was used by the newspaper industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices like [[linotype machine]]s. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch paper tape, rather than the linotype operator having to retype all the incoming stories, the paper tape could be put into a paper tape reader on the linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the [[Friden Flexowriter]], to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of the Linotype/hot lead, many early \"offset\" devices had paper tape readers on them to produce the news-story copy.\n\nIf an error was found at one position on the six-level tape, that character could be turned into a null character to be skipped by punching out the remaining non-punched positions with what was known as a \u201cchicken plucker\". It looked like a strawberry stem remover that, pressed with thumb and forefinger, could punch out the remaining positions, one hole at a time.\n\n===Automated machinery===\n[[File:Paper tape reader on a CNC control 001.jpg|thumb|Paper tape reader on a [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machine]]\n\nIn the 1970s, [[computer-aided manufacturing]] equipment often used paper tape. Paper tape was an important storage medium for computer-controlled [[wire-wrap]] machines, for example. A paper tape reader was smaller and less expensive than [[hollerith card]] or [[magnetic tape]] readers. Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar film]] tape were invented so that production tapes for these machines would last longer.\n\n===Cryptography===\n[[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam ciphers]] were invented in 1917 to encrypt [[teleprinter]] communications using a key stored on paper tape. During the last third of the 20th century, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) used punched paper tape to distribute [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]]. The eight-level paper tapes were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a [[fill device]], such as the hand held [[KOI-18]], that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system ([[EKMS]]), but as of 2016, paper tape is apparently still being employed.<ref name=taleoftape>[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/misc/tale-of-the-tape.shtml Tale of the Tape], NSA/CSS, May 3, 2016, Accessed June 16, 2014</ref> The paper tape canister is a [[tamper-resistant]] container that contains features to prevent undetected alteration of the contents. \n[[File:Papertape2.jpg|thumb|Fanfold paper tape]]\n\n==Limitations==\nThe three biggest problems with paper tape were:\n* Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.\n* Rewinding the tape was difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Some systems used ''fanfold'' paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.\n* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.\n\n==Advantages==\nPunched tape does have some useful properties:\n* Longevity. Although many [[magnetic tape]]s have deteriorated over time to the point that the data on them has been irretrievably lost, punched tape can be read many decades later, if [[acid-free paper]] or Mylar film is used. Some paper can degrade rapidly.\n* Human accessibility.  The hole patterns can be decoded visually if necessary, and torn tape can be repaired (using special all-hole pattern tape splices). Editing text on a punched tape was achieved by literally cutting and pasting the tape with scissors, glue, or by taping over a section to cover all holes and making new holes using a manual hole punch.\n* Magnetic field immunity. In a [[machine shop]] full of powerful electric motors, the [[numerical control]] programs need to survive the magnetic fields generated by those motors.<ref>\n{{cite book |first=N.K. |last=Sinha |title=Microprocessor-Based Control Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgalRre0L8wC&pg=PA264 |date=30 June 1986 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-2287-4 |pages=264 |quote=\"Paper tape is well suited to a machine shop environment whereas magnetic tape may be accidentally erased or contaminated by foreign substances. ...&nbsp;Other disadvantages of paper tape are as follows&nbsp;...\"}}</ref><!--<ref>[http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=72469 \"computer programming punch paper tape\"]: \"Factory computer numerical control (CNC) equipment used paper tape well into the 1980s\"</ref>-->\n* Ease of destruction.  In the case of cryptographic keys, the inherent flammability (sometimes enhanced by using flash paper) of paper tape was an asset.  Once the key had been loaded into the device, the paper tape could simply be burned, preventing the key from falling into enemy hands.\n\n==Punched tape in art==\n\nA computing or telecommunications professional depicted in the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] in Moscow (1964) holds what appears to be a punched tape with three rows of rectangular holes.\n\n==Current use==\nNowadays punched tape use is very rare.

Now effectively obsolete, it was widely used during much of the 20th century for [[teleprinter]] communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for [[minicomputer]]s and [[CNC machine tool]]s.\n\n==Origin==\n\n[[File:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|thumb|right|A paper tape, constructed from [[punched card]]s, in use in a [[Jacquard loom]]. The large holes on each edge are [[sprocket]] holes, used to pull the paper tape through the loom.]]\n\nPaper tapes constructed from punched cards were widely used throughout the 19th century for controlling looms. Perforated paper tapes were first used by [[Basile Bouchon]] in 1725 to control looms. However, the paper tapes were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] had developed machines to create paper tapes by tying punched cards in a sequence for [[Jacquard loom]]s. The resulting paper tape, also called a \"chain of cards\", was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair.\n\nThis led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but as one \"continuous card\" (or tape). Many professional [[embroidery]] operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as \"punchers\" even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out in the 1990s. In 1842, a French patent by Claude Seytre described a [[Player piano|piano playing device]] that read data from [[Piano roll|perforated paper rolls]].\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] used punched tape to send [[telegrams]]. This technology was adopted by [[Charles Wheatstone]] in 1857 for the [[Wheatstone system|preparation, storage and transmission of data]] in telegraphy.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Clive |last=Maxfield |title=How it was: Paper tapes and punched cards |date=13 October 2011 |magazine=EE Times |url=http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?doc_id=1285484}}</ref>\n\nIn 1880s, [[Tolbert Lanston]] invented the [[Monotype System]], which consisted of a keyboard (typesetting machine) and a composition [[Casting (metalworking)|caster]]. The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in 0, 1, or more of 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.\n\n==Tape formats==\n[[File:Harvard Mark I program tape.agr.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A 24-channel program tape for the [[Harvard Mark I]] ]]\n\nData were represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical programmable calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or [[Harvard Mark I]], used paper tape with 24 rows.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Dalakov | first = Georgi | title = History of computers: The MARK computers of Howard Aiken | url = http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Relays/Aiken.html | accessdate = 2011-01-12 }}</ref> A row of smaller sprocket holes that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a [[sprocket|sprocket wheel]]. Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the [[Least significant bit|least significant bits]], when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nText was encoded in several ways. The earliest standard [[character encoding]] was [[Baudot code|Baudot]], which dates back to the 19th century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the [[Baudot code#Murray code|Murray code]] (which added [[carriage return]] and [[line feed]]), [[Western Union code]], [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA 2), and [[American Teletypewriter code]] (USTTY), were used.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.co.com/books?id=q_yq7zvehjoC&pg=PA136\n|title=Technical Handbook for Radio Monitoring HF: Edition 2009\n|last=Proesch\n|first=Roland\n|year=2009\n|publisher=Books on Demand\n|isbn=3837045730\n}}\n</ref> Other standards, such as [[Teletypesetter]] (TTS), [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], had six holes. In the early 1960s, the [[American Standards Association]] led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as [[ASCII]]. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] ([[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]]). Others, such as [[teleprinter|Telex]], stayed with the earlier codes.\n\n===Dimensions===\nTape for punching was 0.00394 inches (0.1&nbsp;mm) thick. The two most common widths were 11/16 inch (17.46&nbsp;mm) for five bit codes, and 1 inch (25.4&nbsp;mm) for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was 0.1 inch (2.54&nbsp;mm) in both directions. Data holes were 0.072 inches (1.83&nbsp;mm) in diameter; feed holes were 0.046 inches (1.17&nbsp;mm).\n\n===Chadless tape===\nMost tape-punching equipment used solid punches to create holes in the tape. This process created \"[[chad (paper)|chad]]\", or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment.\n\n[[File:1980-Paper Tape fromTeletype (chadless, 5-level Baudot)-02.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chadless paper tape|Chadless 5-level Baudot paper tape circa ~1975\u20131980 punched at Teletype Corp.]]\nA variation on the tape punch was a device called a ''Chadless Printing Reperforator''. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no [[chad (paper)|chad]] would be produced; the \"hole\" was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, there was no \"chad box\" to empty from time to time. A disadvantage to this mechanism was that chadless tape, once punched, did not roll up well, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape, so it could not be rolled up tightly. Another disadvantage, as seen over time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape by optical means employed by later high-speed readers. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because it sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.\n\n[[File:Papertape-Wikipedia-example-dark1.svg|thumb|200px|The word \"Wikipedia\", and a [[Newline|CR/LF]] as 7-bit ASCII, without a parity bit, [[least significant bit]] on the right - e.g. \"W\" is 1010111]]\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Communications===\n[[Image:Honolulu IFSS Teletype1964.faa.jpg|thumb|Paper tape relay operation at US [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s Honolulu flight service station in 1964]]\nPunched tape was used as a way of storing messages for [[Teleprinter|teletypewriters]].

NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system ([[EKMS]]), but as of 2016, paper tape is apparently still being employed.<ref name=taleoftape>[https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/misc/tale-of-the-tape.shtml Tale of the Tape], NSA/CSS, May 3, 2016, Accessed June 16, 2014</ref> The paper tape canister is a [[tamper-resistant]] container that contains features to prevent undetected alteration of the contents. \n[[File:Papertape2.jpg|thumb|Fanfold paper tape]]\n\n==Limitations==\nThe three biggest problems with paper tape were:\n{{quote|<poem>* Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.\n* Rewinding the tape was difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Some systems used ''fanfold'' paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.\n* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.</poem>}}\n\n==Advantages==\nPunched tape does have some useful properties:\n* Longevity. Although many [[magnetic tape]]s have deteriorated over time to the point that the data on them has been irretrievably lost, punched tape can be read many decades later, if [[acid-free paper]] or Mylar film is used. Some paper can degrade rapidly.\n* Human accessibility.  The hole patterns can be decoded visually if necessary, and torn tape can be repaired (using special all-hole pattern tape splices). Editing text on a punched tape was achieved by literally cutting and pasting the tape with scissors, glue, or by taping over a section to cover all holes and making new holes using a manual hole punch.\n* Magnetic field immunity. In a [[machine shop]] full of powerful electric motors, the [[numerical control]] programs need to survive the magnetic fields generated by those motors.<ref>\n{{cite book |first=N.K. |last=Sinha |title=Microprocessor-Based Control Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgalRre0L8wC&pg=PA264 |date=30 June 1986 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-2287-4 |pages=264 |quote=\"Paper tape is well suited to a machine shop environment whereas magnetic tape may be accidentally erased or contaminated by foreign substances. ...&nbsp;Other disadvantages of paper tape are as follows&nbsp;...\"}}</ref><!--<ref>[http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=72469 \"computer programming punch paper tape\"]: \"Factory computer numerical control (CNC) equipment used paper tape well into the 1980s\"</ref>-->\n* Ease of destruction.  In the case of cryptographic keys, the inherent flammability (sometimes enhanced by using flash paper) of paper tape was an asset.  Once the key had been loaded into the device, the paper tape could simply be burned, preventing the key from falling into enemy hands.\n\n==Punched tape in art==\n\nA computing or telecommunications professional depicted in the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] in Moscow (1964) holds what appears to be a punched tape with three rows of rectangular holes.\n\n==Current use==\nNowadays punched tape use is very rare. It may still be used in older military systems{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and by some hobbyists. In [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining applications, very few people still use tape.

He was appointed Indiana's [[Adjutant General|adjutant general]] and commanded the [[11th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]. Wallace, who attained the rank of major general, participated in the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]], the [[Battle of Shiloh]], and the [[Battle of Monocacy]]. He also served on the military commission for the trials of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln#Conspirators' trial|Lincoln assassination conspirators]], and presided over the trial of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant of the [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison camp]].\n\nWallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican army, before returning to the United States. Wallace was appointed [[governor of New Mexico|governor]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]] (1878\u201381) and served as U.S. minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1881\u201385). Wallace retired to his home in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], where he continued to write until his death in 1905.\n\n==Early life and education==\nLewis \"Lew\" Wallace was born on April 10, 1827, in [[Brookville, Indiana|Brookville]], [[Indiana]].

He was appointed a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]], and on June 19, 1846, mustered into military service with the Marion Volunteers (also known as Company H, 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry).<ref>Stephens, p. 4; Boomhower, p. 3, 26\u201327; Morrow, p. 6.</ref> Wallace rose to the position of regimental adjutant and the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] while serving in the army of [[Zachary Taylor]], but Wallace personally did not participate in combat.<ref>Warner, pp. 536\u201337; Woodworth, p. 64.</ref> Wallace was mustered out of the volunteer service on June 15, 1847,<ref name=Eicher551>Eicher, p. 551.</ref> and returned to Indiana, where he intended to practice law.<ref>Stephens, p. 8.</ref> After the war, Wallace and William B.

Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and a flotilla of Union ironclads and [[timberclad warship|timberclad]] gunboats under the command of Flag Officer [[Andrew Hull Foote]] made their way toward the Confederate fort along the [[Tennessee River]] in western [[Tennessee]]. Wallace's brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]]'s division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace's troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]], surrendered Fort Henry to Grant.<ref name=Stephens45-47>Stephens, pp. 45\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Donelson Feb15pm.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing Wallace's counterattack at [[Fort Donelson]] (1862)]]\nGrant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W.

The order came at midnight on February 13. Wallace arrived along the Cumberland River the following day and was placed in charge of the 3rd [[division (military)|Division]]. Many of the men in the division were untested reinforcements.<ref>Stephens, p. 48.</ref> Wallace's three brigades took up position in the center of the Union line, facing Fort Donelson.<ref name=Boom50/>\n\nDuring the fierce Confederate assault on February 15, and in Grant's absence from the battlefield, Wallace acted on his own initiative to send Cruft's brigade to reinforce the beleaguered division of Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], despite orders from Grant to hold his position and prevent the enemy from escaping and without Grant's authority to take the offensive.<ref>Boomhower, p. 51.</ref><ref>Grant later approved of Wallace's actions. See Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace's decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right.<ref>Stephens, p. 62; Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> On March 21, 1862, Wallace, McClernand, and C.

Gen. Grant.\n\nWhat was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace's written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division's movements on the first day of battle, and their late arrival on the field.<ref>Ferraro, p. 129; Stephens, p. 84.</ref> On the second day of battle, Wallace's division joined reinforcements from Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army to play an important role in the Union victory.<ref>Boomhower, p. 7.</ref> Prior to the battle, Wallace's division had been left in reserve and was encamped near Crump's Landing. Their orders were to guard the Union's right flank and cover the road to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the south.<ref>Stephens, pp. 65, 72; Ferraro, p. 128.</ref> To protect the road from Crump's Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col.

Charles Whittlesey to [[Adamsville, Tennessee|Adamsville]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing. Col. [[Morgan Lewis Smith|Morgan L.

[[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 83; Ferraro, p. 129.</ref> Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30&nbsp;a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered.<ref>Stephens, pp. 83\u201384; Boomhower, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.<ref>Stephens, pp. 71, 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nKnowledge of the area's roads played a critical role in Wallace's journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump's Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace's men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman's camp. Brig. Gen. [[W. H. L. Wallace]]'s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.<ref>Stephens, pp. 72, 74.</ref>\n\nOf the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the [[shunpiking|Shunpike]] road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's division near Shiloh Church.<ref>Stephens, p. 86; Boomhower, p. 60.</ref> The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so.<ref>Stephens, p. 75.</ref> Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, p. 85; Boomhower, pp. 59\u201360.</ref><ref>Grant, v. I, pp. 336\u201337.</ref> Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nAfter a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace's division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield.<ref>Stephens, pp. 82, 87.</ref> Between 2 and 2:30&nbsp;p.m., a third messenger from Grant found Wallace along the Shunpike road, where he informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, pp. 87\u201388; Boomhower, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was to the rear of the advancing Southern troops.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nWallace considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in the lead position to support the Union infantry on the field<ref>Boomhower, p. 61.</ref> After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace's troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant's army on the field. Progress was slow due to the road conditions and countermarch. Wallace's division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30&nbsp;p.m., after having marched about {{convert|14|mi|km}} in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting nearly over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.<ref>Stephens, pp. 80, 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr7.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, April 7, 1862]]\nThe next day, April 7, Wallace's division held the extreme right of the Union line.

Gen. Lew Wallace]]\nAt first, the battle was viewed by the [[Northern United States|North]] as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation.<ref>Stephens, pp. 105\u20136, and Boomhower, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, placed the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up the reserves on April 6 had nearly cost them the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8>Stephens, pp. 107\u201308.</ref>\n\nGrant had placed much of the blame on General Wallace, to whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders\", and first sent Colonel [[William R. Rowley]],<ref>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243</ref> ordering him to \"tell him to come up at once\" and that \"if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once\". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, \"Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.\" Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.<ref>[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305</ref><ref>[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from active duty, placing both of them in reserve.<ref>Stephens, p. 112; Morrow, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWallace's reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.<ref name=Morrow9/> He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8/> On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.<ref>Ferraro, p. 131\u201334, 138, and 145.</ref>\n\nFor many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle.<ref>Ferraro, p. 146.</ref> After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind.<ref name=Stephens232>Stephens, p. 232.</ref><ref name=Ferraro147>Ferraro, p. 147.</ref> Grant wrote a letter to the editors at ''Century'', which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter \"modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh.\"<ref name=Ferraro147 /> While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.<ref name=\"Stephens232\" /><ref name=Grant>Grant, v. I, pp. 351\u201352.</ref>\n\nGrant's article in the February 1885 issue of ''Century'' became the basis of his chapter on Shiloh in his memoirs, which were published in 1886, and influenced many later accounts of Wallace's actions on the first day of battle.<ref name=Ferraro147 /> Grant acknowledged in his memoirs: \"If the position of our front had not changed, the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road.\"<ref name=Grant /> Wallace's account of the events appeared in his autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1906.<ref>Ferraro, p. 148.</ref> Despite his later fame and fortune as the writer of ''Ben-Hur'', Wallace continued to lament, \"Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.\"{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\n===Other military assignments===\nOn August 17, 1862, Wallace accepted a regiment command in the [[Department of the Ohio]] to help with the successful [[defense of Cincinnati]] during [[Braxton Bragg]]'s incursion into [[Kentucky]]. Next, Wallace took command of [[Camp Chase]], a prisoner-of-war camp at [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he remained until October 30, 1862. A month later Wallace was placed in charge of a five-member commission to investigate Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of [[Kentucky]]. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission's work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command.<ref>Stephens, pp. 127, 137\u201346.</ref> In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at [[North Vernon, Indiana]], from Confederate general [[Morgan's Raid|John Hunt Morgan's raid]] into southern Indiana.<ref>Stephens, pp. 153\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Monocacy===\n{{Main|Battle of Monocacy}}\nWallace's most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the [[Battle of Monocacy]] part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Although Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Boomhower, p. 8.</ref> Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war,<ref>Kennedy, p. 308.</ref> but Union reinforcements had already arrived at [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.<ref>Kennedy, p. 305; Stephens, p. 204.</ref>\n\nWallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]], which was headquartered in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 161\u201362, 164, 175; Boomhower, pp. 8, 69.</ref> On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under [[James B. Ricketts]] from [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 192.</ref> Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived.<ref>Stephens, pp. 185\u201386.</ref> Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.<ref>Boomhower, p. 73; Stephens, pp. 196, 200.</ref><ref>Kennedy, p. 305.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|E. O. C. Ord]] as Wallace's replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace's efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps.<ref>Stephens, pp. 201, 203, 205; Boomhower, p. 74.</ref> In [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's memoirs]], he praised Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy:\n\n<blockquote>If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.&nbsp;... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.<ref>Grant, [http://www.bartleby.com/1011/57.html Chapter LVII, p. 13.]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Later military service===\nOn January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the [[Rio Grande]] in southern [[Texas]] to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government's unofficial efforts to aid in expelling [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's]] French occupation forces from Mexico.<ref>Stephens, pp. 212\u201317.</ref>\n\nFollowing President Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination conspirators]]. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty.<ref>Stephens, pp. 219, 221\u201322; Morrow, p. 11.</ref> In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant in charge of the South's [[Andersonville prison camp]]. The [[court-martial]] which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.<ref name=Eicher551/><ref>Stephens, pp. 223, 226;  Boomhower, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace's service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30,<ref name=Eicher773 /><ref>Stephens, p. 227.</ref> and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez|Ju\u00e1rez]] government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.<ref>Morrow, p. 12.</ref><ref>Wallace received $15,000 from the Mexican government in 1882. See Stephens, pp. 215\u201317, 229.</ref>\n\n==Political and diplomatic career==\nWallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics.<ref>Morrow, p. 11.</ref> Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the 1876 election.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]], where he served from August 1878 to March 1881.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 98, 101; Ferraro, p. 142; Morrow, p. 15.</ref> His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican [[President of the United States|president]] [[James A. Garfield]] appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.<ref>Stephens, pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n===Territorial governor of New Mexico===\nWallace arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 97, 101.</ref> Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], a contentious and violent disagreement among the county's residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 107; Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> In 1880, while living at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for ''Ben Hur''.<ref>Boomhower, p. 108; Morrow, pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings.<ref name=Boom102>Boomhower, p. 102.</ref> One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as [[Billy the Kid]].<ref>Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace's protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be \"scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds.\"<ref>Utley, p. 118.</ref> On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for a \"fake\" arrest and Bonney's detention in a local jail to assure his safety.<ref>Boomhower, p. 103.</ref> Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free.<ref name=Humanities/> After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 106\u201307, 111.</ref>\n\nOn December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney's supporters, citing a \"lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity\" over Wallace's promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Lacey|title=No Pardon for Billy the Kid|work=New York Times|date=2010-12-31|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/us/01billy.html|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Wallace Az indus herceg.png|thumb|200px|''The Prince of India'' (Hungarian edition, 1930s)]]\n\nOn May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the British ambassador. Although Wallace's efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 112, 118, 122.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper ''[[Havatzelet]]'' (xiii. No. 6) titled \"An American and yet a Despot\". The editorial caused the ''Havatzelet'' to be suspended and its editor [[Israel Dov Frumkin]] to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace's request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. ''Havatzelet'' claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.<ref>Sokolow, Sefer Zikkaron, pp. 175\u201380, Warsaw, 1890.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Wallace's diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area, the site for his novel, ''Ben-Hur'', and did research in Constantinople, the locale for ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'', which he began writing in 1887.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 119, 125.</ref>\n\nThe election of [[Grover Cleveland]], the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace's political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885.<ref name=Boom122>Boomhower, p. 122.</ref> The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.<ref name=Boom122/><ref>Stephens, pp. 230\u201331; Morrow, p. 21.</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nWallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), which established his fame as an author.<ref>Morrow, p. 11; Forbes, p. 387.</ref>\n\nIn 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.<ref>Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> The popular historical novel, with Cortez's conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on [[William H.

Wallace considered ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'' (1893) as his best novel.<ref>Boomhower, p. 126.</ref> He also wrote a biography of President [[Benjamin Harrison]], a fellow Hoosier and Civil War general, and ''The Wooing of Malkatoon'' (1898), a narrative poem. Wallace was writing his autobiography when he died in 1905. His wife Susan completed it with the assistance of [[Mary Hannah Krout]], another author from Crawfordsville. It was published posthumously in 1906.<ref>Stephens, pp. 234, 236.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nWallace continued to write after his return from Turkey. He also patented several of his own inventions, built a seven-story apartment building in Indianapolis, [[The Blacherne]], and drew up plans for a private study at his home in Crawfordsville.<ref>Boomhower, p. 126; Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 415.</ref> Wallace remained active in veterans groups, including writing a speech for the dedication of the battlefield at the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 232\u201333.</ref>\n\nWallace's elaborate writing study, which he described as \"a pleasure-house for my soul\",<ref>Morrow, p. 35.</ref> served as his private retreat.<ref name=Humanities/> Now called the [[General Lew Wallace Study|General Lew Wallace Study and Museum]], it was built between 1895 and 1898, adjacent to his residence in Crawfordsville, and set in an enclosed park.

In winter, he would fire up the coal furnace in the Study basement and fish from the windows. He loved fishing so much he invented and patented a special traveler's fishing pole. After just a few years he had the moat drained as it was negatively affecting the Study foundation and he worried about his grandchildren and neighborhood children falling into the water.\n\nOn April 5, 1898, at the outbreak of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Wallace, at age seventy-one, offered to raise and lead a force of soldiers, but the war office refused. Undeterred, he went to a local recruiting office and attempted to enlist as a private, but was rejected again, presumably because of his age.<ref>Stephens, p. 236; Boomhower, p. 129; Morrow, p. 22.</ref>\n\nWallace's service at the battle of Shiloh continued to haunt him in later life. The debate persisted in book publications, magazine articles, pamphlets, speeches, and in private correspondence.<ref>Stephens, p. 231; Ferraro, pp. 143\u201344.</ref> Wallace attended a reunion at Shiloh in 1894, his first return since 1862, and retraced his journey to the battlefield with veterans from the 3rd Division. He returned to Shiloh for a final time in 1901 to walk the battlefield with David W. Reed, the Shiloh Battlefield Commission's historian, and others.

Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and a flotilla of Union ironclads and [[timberclad warship|timberclad]] gunboats under the command of Flag Officer [[Andrew Hull Foote]] made their way toward the Confederate fort along the [[Tennessee River]] in western [[Tennessee]]. Wallace's brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]]'s division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace's troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]], surrendered Fort Henry to Grant.<ref name=Stephens45-47>Stephens, pp. 45\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Donelson Feb15pm.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing Wallace's counterattack at [[Fort Donelson]] (1862)]]\nGrant's superior, Maj.

Many of the men in the division were untested reinforcements.<ref>Stephens, p. 48.</ref> Wallace's three brigades took up position in the center of the Union line, facing Fort Donelson.<ref name=Boom50/>\n\nDuring the fierce Confederate assault on February 15, and in Grant's absence from the battlefield, Wallace acted on his own initiative to send Cruft's brigade to reinforce the beleaguered division of Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], despite orders from Grant to hold his position and prevent the enemy from escaping and without Grant's authority to take the offensive.<ref>Boomhower, p. 51.</ref><ref>Grant later approved of Wallace's actions. See Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace's decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right.<ref>Stephens, p. 62; Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> On March 21, 1862, Wallace, McClernand, and C.

Gen. Grant.\n\nWhat was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace's written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division's movements on the first day of battle, and their late arrival on the field.<ref>Ferraro, p. 129; Stephens, p. 84.</ref> On the second day of battle, Wallace's division joined reinforcements from Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army to play an important role in the Union victory.<ref>Boomhower, p. 7.</ref> Prior to the battle, Wallace's division had been left in reserve and was encamped near Crump's Landing. Their orders were to guard the Union's right flank and cover the road to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the south.<ref>Stephens, pp. 65, 72; Ferraro, p. 128.</ref> To protect the road from Crump's Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col. [[John Milton Thayer|John M. Thayer]]'s 2nd Brigade to Stoney Lonesome, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing, and the 3rd Brigade, commanded by Col. Charles Whittlesey to [[Adamsville, Tennessee|Adamsville]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing. Col. [[Morgan Lewis Smith|Morgan L. Smith]]'s 1st Brigade remained with Wallace at Crump's Landing, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].<ref>Stephens, p. 76.</ref>\n\nBetween 5 and 6 a.m. on April 6, 1862, Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing was surprised and nearly routed by a sudden attack from the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 83; Ferraro, p. 129.</ref> Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30&nbsp;a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered.<ref>Stephens, pp. 83\u201384; Boomhower, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.<ref>Stephens, pp. 71, 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nKnowledge of the area's roads played a critical role in Wallace's journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump's Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace's men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman's camp. Brig. Gen. [[W. H. L. Wallace]]'s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.<ref>Stephens, pp. 72, 74.</ref>\n\nOf the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the [[shunpiking|Shunpike]] road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's division near Shiloh Church.<ref>Stephens, p. 86; Boomhower, p. 60.</ref> The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so.<ref>Stephens, p. 75.</ref> Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, p. 85; Boomhower, pp. 59\u201360.</ref><ref>Grant, v. I, pp. 336\u201337.</ref> Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nAfter a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace's division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield.<ref>Stephens, pp. 82, 87.</ref> Between 2 and 2:30&nbsp;p.m., a third messenger from Grant found Wallace along the Shunpike road, where he informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, pp. 87\u201388; Boomhower, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was to the rear of the advancing Southern troops.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nWallace considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in the lead position to support the Union infantry on the field<ref>Boomhower, p. 61.</ref> After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace's troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant's army on the field. Progress was slow due to the road conditions and countermarch. Wallace's division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30&nbsp;p.m., after having marched about {{convert|14|mi|km}} in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting nearly over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.<ref>Stephens, pp. 80, 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr7.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, April 7, 1862]]\nThe next day, April 7, Wallace's division held the extreme right of the Union line.

Gen. Lew Wallace]]\nAt first, the battle was viewed by the [[Northern United States|North]] as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation.<ref>Stephens, pp. 105\u20136, and Boomhower, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, placed the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up the reserves on April 6 had nearly cost them the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8>Stephens, pp. 107\u201308.</ref>\n\nGrant had placed much of the blame on General Wallace, to whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders\", and first sent Colonel [[William R. Rowley]],<ref>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243</ref> ordering him to \"tell him to come up at once\" and that \"if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once\". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, \"Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.\" Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.<ref>[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305</ref><ref>[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from active duty, placing both of them in reserve.<ref>Stephens, p. 112; Morrow, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWallace's reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.<ref name=Morrow9/> He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8/> On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.<ref>Ferraro, p. 131\u201334, 138, and 145.</ref>\n\nFor many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle.<ref>Ferraro, p. 146.</ref> After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind.<ref name=Stephens232>Stephens, p. 232.</ref><ref name=Ferraro147>Ferraro, p. 147.</ref> Grant wrote a letter to the editors at ''Century'', which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter \"modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh.\"<ref name=Ferraro147 /> While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.<ref name=\"Stephens232\" /><ref name=Grant>Grant, v.

Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.\"{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\n===Other military assignments===\nOn August 17, 1862, Wallace accepted a regiment command in the [[Department of the Ohio]] to help with the successful [[defense of Cincinnati]] during [[Braxton Bragg]]'s incursion into [[Kentucky]]. Next, Wallace took command of [[Camp Chase]], a prisoner-of-war camp at [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he remained until October 30, 1862. A month later Wallace was placed in charge of a five-member commission to investigate Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of [[Kentucky]]. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission's work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command.<ref>Stephens, pp. 127, 137\u201346.</ref> In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at [[North Vernon, Indiana]], from Confederate general [[Morgan's Raid|John Hunt Morgan's raid]] into southern Indiana.<ref>Stephens, pp. 153\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Monocacy===\n{{Main|Battle of Monocacy}}\nWallace's most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the [[Battle of Monocacy]] part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Although Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Boomhower, p. 8.</ref> Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war,<ref>Kennedy, p. 308.</ref> but Union reinforcements had already arrived at [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.<ref>Kennedy, p. 305; Stephens, p. 204.</ref>\n\nWallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]], which was headquartered in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 161\u201362, 164, 175; Boomhower, pp. 8, 69.</ref> On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under [[James B. Ricketts]] from [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 192.</ref> Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived.<ref>Stephens, pp. 185\u201386.</ref> Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.<ref>Boomhower, p. 73; Stephens, pp. 196, 200.</ref><ref>Kennedy, p. 305.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|E. O. C. Ord]] as Wallace's replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace's efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps.<ref>Stephens, pp. 201, 203, 205; Boomhower, p. 74.</ref> In [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's memoirs]], he praised Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy:\n\n<blockquote>If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.&nbsp;... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.<ref>Grant, [http://www.bartleby.com/1011/57.html Chapter LVII, p. 13.]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Later military service===\nOn January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the [[Rio Grande]] in southern [[Texas]] to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government's unofficial efforts to aid in expelling [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's]] French occupation forces from Mexico.<ref>Stephens, pp. 212\u201317.</ref>\n\nFollowing President Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination conspirators]]. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty.<ref>Stephens, pp. 219, 221\u201322; Morrow, p. 11.</ref> In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant in charge of the South's [[Andersonville prison camp]]. The [[court-martial]] which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.<ref name=Eicher551/><ref>Stephens, pp. 223, 226;  Boomhower, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace's service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30,<ref name=Eicher773 /><ref>Stephens, p. 227.</ref> and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez|Ju\u00e1rez]] government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.<ref>Morrow, p. 12.</ref><ref>Wallace received $15,000 from the Mexican government in 1882. See Stephens, pp. 215\u201317, 229.</ref>\n\n==Political and diplomatic career==\nWallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics.<ref>Morrow, p. 11.</ref> Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the 1876 election.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]], where he served from August 1878 to March 1881.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 98, 101; Ferraro, p. 142; Morrow, p. 15.</ref> His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican [[President of the United States|president]] [[James A. Garfield]] appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.<ref>Stephens, pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n===Territorial governor of New Mexico===\nWallace arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 97, 101.</ref> Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], a contentious and violent disagreement among the county's residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 107; Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> In 1880, while living at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for ''Ben Hur''.<ref>Boomhower, p. 108; Morrow, pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings.<ref name=Boom102>Boomhower, p. 102.</ref> One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as [[Billy the Kid]].<ref>Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace's protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be \"scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds.\"<ref>Utley, p. 118.</ref> On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for a \"fake\" arrest and Bonney's detention in a local jail to assure his safety.<ref>Boomhower, p. 103.</ref> Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free.<ref name=Humanities/> After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 106\u201307, 111.</ref>\n\nOn December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney's supporters, citing a \"lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity\" over Wallace's promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Lacey|title=No Pardon for Billy the Kid|work=New York Times|date=2010-12-31|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/us/01billy.html|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Wallace Az indus herceg.png|thumb|200px|''The Prince of India'' (Hungarian edition, 1930s)]]\n\nOn May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the British ambassador. Although Wallace's efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 112, 118, 122.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper ''[[Havatzelet]]'' (xiii. No. 6) titled \"An American and yet a Despot\". The editorial caused the ''Havatzelet'' to be suspended and its editor [[Israel Dov Frumkin]] to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace's request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. ''Havatzelet'' claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.<ref>Sokolow, Sefer Zikkaron, pp. 175\u201380, Warsaw, 1890.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Wallace's diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area, the site for his novel, ''Ben-Hur'', and did research in Constantinople, the locale for ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'', which he began writing in 1887.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 119, 125.</ref>\n\nThe election of [[Grover Cleveland]], the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace's political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885.<ref name=Boom122>Boomhower, p. 122.</ref> The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.<ref name=Boom122/><ref>Stephens, pp. 230\u201331; Morrow, p. 21.</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nWallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), which established his fame as an author.<ref>Morrow, p. 11; Forbes, p. 387.</ref>\n\nIn 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.<ref>Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> The popular historical novel, with Cortez's conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on [[William H. Prescott]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.<ref>Forbes, p. 387; McKee, \"The Early Life of Lew Wallace\", p. 215.</ref> Wallace's book sold seven thousand copies in its first year.

German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale [[plantation]] operations and developing new industries, notably, cocoa bean and rubber, relying on imported labourers from China and [[Melanesia]]. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests.

About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]].

As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work=Samoa.co.uk | access-date=27 November 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117045520/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | archive-date=17 November 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the ''[[fa'ataupati]]'' or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe form and construction of traditional [[architecture of Samoa]] was a specialised skill by ''Tufuga fai fale'' that was also linked to other cultural artforms.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Catholic church in Samoa-2.jpg|Roman Catholic [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary cathedral.\nFile:Siva Afi - Fire spinning.jpg|A Samoan fire dancer.\nFile:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|A [[Architecture of Samoa|fale]] on [[Manono Island]]\nFile:Apia Samoa Temple-new.jpg|LDS [[Apia Samoa Temple]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tattooing===\n\n[[File:Samoan Malu.jpg|thumb|A Samoan woman with a traditional [[malu]].]]\n\nAs with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawaiian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]]) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.

When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]]. [[Pineapple]]s grow well in Samoa, but beyond local consumption have not been a major export.\n\nSixty percent of Samoa's electricity comes from renewable hydro, solar, and wind sources, with the remainder from diesel generators.

As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work=Samoa.co.uk | access-date=27 November 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117045520/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | archive-date=17 November 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the ''[[fa'ataupati]]'' or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe form and construction of traditional [[architecture of Samoa]] was a specialised skill by ''Tufuga fai fale'' that was also linked to other cultural artforms.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Catholic church in Samoa-2.jpg|Roman Catholic [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary cathedral.\nFile:Siva Afi - Fire spinning.jpg|A Samoan fire dancer.\nFile:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|A [[Architecture of Samoa|fale]] on [[Manono Island]]\nFile:Apia Samoa Temple-new.jpg|LDS [[Apia Samoa Temple]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tattooing===\n\n[[File:Samoan Malu.jpg|thumb|A Samoan woman with a traditional [[malu]].]]\n\nAs with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawaiian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]]) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.
