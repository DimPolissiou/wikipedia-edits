This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent. \n\n\"Some 1.8 billion (more than 70%) of the population at risk for dengue worldwide live in member states of the WHO South-East Asia Region and Western Pacific Region, which bear nearly 75% of the current global disease burden due to dengue.

Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.<ref name=berry/> If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.<ref name=berry/> These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainty about future risks.<ref name=\"clayton\"/> They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.<ref name=berry/> This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event affects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.<ref name=berry/>\n[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.<ref name=worldhealth/> Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.<ref name=berry/>\n\nAs extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}</ref> [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.<ref name=bowlby>{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279\u2013294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}</ref> Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase.

Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.<ref name=epstein>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref> The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.<ref name=epstein/> These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.<ref name=epstein/> An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.<ref name=bowlby/>\n\nSome impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].<ref name=clayton/> The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.<ref name=portier/> Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.<ref name=portier/>\n\nThe effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources<ref name=epstein/> Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.<ref name=epstein/> Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.<ref name=portier/>  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.<ref name=portier/>\n\n====Psychological impacts====\nPsychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.<ref name=clayton/> Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.<ref name=berry/><ref name=clayton/> Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.<ref name=clayton/> Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.<ref name=portier/> Agriculture is severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.<ref name=clayton/> During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.<ref name=clayton/> Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of children from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.<ref name=bowlby/> \n\nThe loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.<ref name=clayton/> Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.<ref name=bowlby/><ref>{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}</ref> The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections.

Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the \u201cwet season\u201d in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water.

[[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031172136/http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Impact on livestock==\nClimate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.\n\n===Greenhouse gas effects===\nOur agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=strategies>{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016\u20132025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%.

Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions.

Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.<ref name=\"impact\" /> Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.\n\n==Impact on plant based food==\n[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops\u2014from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels\u2014all of which directly affect [[human health]].

On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/>\n\nDroughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.<ref name=Connor/> The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of \u201cblue water\u201d currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=Beddington/>  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this historical method of weed control will no longer be possible.<ref name=Rod10>{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210\u2013221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}</ref>\n\nWith more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.<ref name=Hertel/> Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.<ref name=Beddington/>\n\n===Financial===\nSome research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.<ref name=Hertel/> However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.<ref name=\"Tubiello & Soussana\"/> In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].<ref name=\"Tubiello & Soussana\"/> The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Sindhu/> This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.\n\n===Pests and pathogens===\nCurrently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species\u2019 defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.<ref name=Chakra/>\n\nCurrently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<ref name=Chakra/> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<ref name=Rod11>{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.

Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]].

Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].\n\n===Coral===\nWith degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<ref name=\"atoll\">{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88\u201389|pages=76\u201384|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}</ref><ref name=\"child\">{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328\u20131332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}</ref> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands.

With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed.

These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Ni\u00f1o cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Epstein/> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<ref name=Epstein/>\n\n===Drought===\nArguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.\nA number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.\nDuring times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110\u2013118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S\u2013181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}</ref>  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.<ref name=alderman>{{cite journal |last=Alderman |first=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37\u201347 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:346602/UQ346602_OA.pdf }}</ref>\n\nMortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].<ref name=alderman/>  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.<ref name=alderman/> Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.<ref>thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water</ref>\n\nInjuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.<ref name=alderman/>  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.<ref name=alderman/>  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=alderman/>\n\nNon-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\nAnother result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,<ref name=\"Storms and Sickness\">{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pp=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161 161\u2013178]|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&pg=PA161|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161}}</ref> and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.<ref name=\"The Mosquito's Bite\" /><ref name=\"Sobering Predictions\" /> [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds.

Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the \u201clungs of the Earth\u201d.<ref name=pinebeetle/> These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]].

This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts.

According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise.

Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves.

Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves.

Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.<ref name=berry/> If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.<ref name=berry/> These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainty about future risks.<ref name=\"clayton\"/> They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.<ref name=berry/> This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event affects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.<ref name=berry/>\n[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.<ref name=worldhealth/> Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.<ref name=berry/>\n\nAs extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}</ref> [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions.

After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.<ref name=epstein/> These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.<ref name=epstein/> An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.<ref name=bowlby/>\n\nSome impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].<ref name=clayton/> The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.<ref name=portier/> Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.<ref name=portier/>\n\nThe effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources<ref name=epstein/> Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.<ref name=epstein/> Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.<ref name=portier/>  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.<ref name=portier/>\n\n====Psychological impacts====\nPsychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.<ref name=clayton/> Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.<ref name=berry/><ref name=clayton/> Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.<ref name=clayton/> Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.<ref name=portier/> Agriculture is severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.<ref name=clayton/> During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.<ref name=clayton/> Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of children from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.<ref name=bowlby/> \n\nThe loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.<ref name=clayton/> Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government.

Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the \u201cwet season\u201d in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water.

This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031172136/http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Impact on livestock==\nClimate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.\n\n===Greenhouse gas effects===\nOur agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name=strategies>{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016\u20132025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.<ref name=\"strategies\" />\n\nThe types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: [[monogastric]] and [[ruminant]]. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.<ref name=\"strategies\" />\n\nAs lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.<ref name=\"strategies\" /><ref name=impact>{{Cite journal |first1=P.K. |last1=Thornton |first2=J. |last2=van de Steeg |first3=A. |last3=Notenbaert |first4=M. |last4=Herrero |title=The impacts of climate change on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries: A review of what we know and what we need to know |journal=Agricultural Systems |year=2009 |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=113\u2013127 |doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2009.05.002}}</ref> This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.<ref name=\"strategies\" />\n\nThere are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.<ref name=\"strategies\" /><ref name=\"impact\" /><ref>{{cite report |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kurukulasuriya |first2=Shane |last2=Rosenthal |title=Climate Change and Agriculture: A Review of Impacts and Adaptions |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~c-ciarn/documents/World_Bank_Paper.pdf}}</ref><ref name=who>{{cite report |first1=A.J. |last1=McMichael |first2=D.H. |last2=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=C.F. |last3=Corval\u00e1n |first4=K.L. |last4=Ebi |first5=A.K. |last5=Githeko |first6=J.D. |last6=Scheraga |first7=A. |last7=Woodward |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2003 |isbn=92 4 156248 X |url=http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climchange.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Heat stress===\n[[Heat stress]] on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.<ref name=\"impact\" /> Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.\n\n==Impact on plant based food==\n[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops\u2014from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels\u2014all of which directly affect [[human health]].

On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/>\n\nDroughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers.

[[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.<ref name=Hertel/> Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.<ref name=Beddington/>\n\n===Financial===\nSome research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.<ref name=Hertel/> However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden.

Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species\u2019 defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.<ref name=Chakra/>\n\nCurrently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<ref name=Chakra/> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<ref name=\"Ferber & Epstein\"/> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<ref name=Rod11>{{cite journal |last=Rodenburg |first=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D.

Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].\n\n===Coral===\nWith degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<ref name=\"atoll\">{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88\u201389|pages=76\u201384|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}</ref><ref name=\"child\">{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328\u20131332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}</ref> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands.

With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].<ref name=pseudo>{{cite journal |last=Tatters |first=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e32116 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}</ref>  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.<ref name=pseudo/>  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.<ref name=pseudo/>\n\n==Extreme weather events==\nInfectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Ni\u00f1o cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation|El Ni\u00f1o]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Epstein/> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<ref name=Epstein/>\n\n===Drought===\nArguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.\nA number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.\nDuring times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110\u2013118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S\u2013181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]].

The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].<ref name=alderman/>  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.<ref name=alderman/> Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.<ref>thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water</ref>\n\nInjuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.<ref name=alderman/>  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.<ref name=alderman/>  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=alderman/>\n\nNon-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.<ref name=alderman/>\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\nAnother result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,<ref name=\"Storms and Sickness\">{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pp=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161 161\u2013178]|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&pg=PA161|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161}}</ref> and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.<ref name=\"The Mosquito's Bite\" /><ref name=\"Sobering Predictions\" /> [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds.

It is operated as part of the [[MBTA Bus]] system, but branded as [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) as part of the [[MBTA subway]] system. Six routes are operated as part of two disconnected corridors. {{As of|2019}}, weekday ridership on the Silver Line was 39,000.\n\nThe four Waterfront routes operate out of an underground terminal at {{bts|South Station Under}} and run through the South Boston Piers Transitway - a dedicated bus tunnel through the [[Seaport District]] with stations at {{bts|Courthouse}} and {{bts|World Trade Center}} . At {{bts|Silver Line Way}}, they fan out on the surface: the SL1 to [[Logan International Airport]], the SL2 to [[Boston Marine Industrial Park|Design Center]], and the SL3 to {{bts|Chelsea}} via [[East Boston]]. (An additional [[short turn]] route, SLW, runs only at peak hours between South Station and Silver Line Way.) The SL1 and SL3 operate in [[mixed traffic]] through the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]]; the SL3 uses a limited-access [[haul road]] in East Boston and a dedicated busway in Chelsea for part of its route. The SL2 operates in mixed traffic in the Seaport. The Waterfront routes use [[articulated buses|articulated]] [[dual-mode bus]]es that operate as electric [[trolleybus]]es in the Transitway and conventional diesel buses on the surface. Battery electric buses and a diesel hybrid bus with extended battery range are being tested; one of the types may ultimately replace the dual-mode buses.\n\nTwo routes operate on [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]] between [[Dudley Square station]] (at [[Nubian Square]] in [[Roxbury (Boston)|Roxbury]]) and [[Downtown Boston]]. The SL5 terminates at {{bts|Downtown Crossing}} and the SL4 on the surface at {{bts|South Station Under}}. The two routes operate mostly in [[bus lane|dedicated lanes]] on Washington Street and Essex Street, though sections in Downtown Boston and Nubian Square operate in mixed traffic. They use articulated diesel hybrid buses, which replaced [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG)-powered buses in 2016\u201317.\n\nThe Washington Street corridor was built to replace the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] [[rapid transit]] line, which was moved from the [[Washington Street Elevated]] to the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] in 1987. Initial plans called for a [[light rail]] line operated as part of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]], but trolleybuses and later CNG buses were substituted. Service improvements to the route 49 bus began in 2001, and the Silver Line brand was introduced on July 20, 2002. The articulated CNG buses began operation in 2003. On October 13, 2009, the SL4 began service and the original route was designated SL5.\n\nPlanning began in 1987 for mass transit to serve the growing Seaport; a new transit tunnel called the South Boston Piers Transitway was chosen in 1989. It was to run from {{bts|Boylston}} to World Trade Center via {{bts|Chinatown}} and South Station, though the Boylston-South Station section was later deferred as a separate phase. After years of delays, service through the $624 million Transitway began on December 17, 2004. SL2 and SL3 service began on December 31, 2004, with the SL1 added on June 1, 2005. The original SL3 route to {{bts|City Point}} was discontinued on March 20, 2009. A separate SL3 route to Chelsea \u2014 originally planned as part of the cancelled [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring Project]] \u2013 began service on April 21, 2018.\n\nIn 1999, the MBTA designated the Washington Street and Transitway projects as the Silver Line, and planned for the Boylston tunnel extension to include a portal to Washington Street for through-running. The connecting tunnel from Washington Street to Boylston was designated as Phase III. After several design changes, by 2005 Phase III was expected to cost around $800 million; projected completion had been delayed from 2006 to 2010, then to 2013. The project was placed on hold in 2005; planning resumed in 2006 after the controversial portal was relocated. However, the project cost rose to $2.1 billion, and it was cancelled in 2010. Several other Silver Line extensions have been proposed, as has a conversion of the Washington Street corridor to light rail, but most have not been pursued.\n\nThe Silver Line has been the target of criticism by riders and transportation planners. The choice of buses rather than light rail on Washington Street was viewed by Roxbury residents as a deliberate slight, leading to the nickname of \"The Silver Lie.\" Much of the Silver Line is missing [[BRT Standard]] features such as enforced dedicated lanes, off-vehicle fare collection, sheltered stations, and [[transit signal priority]]; a 2011 report by the [[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]] (ITDP) called the Silver Line \"Not BRT\". Because the Transitway was not originally designed for service to Logan Airport or Chelsea, it does not have a direct connection to the Ted Williams Tunnel. A normally-unused ramp would shorten the outbound routing by {{convert|0.7|miles}}; after years of controversy, [[MassDOT]] agreed in 2019 to allow limited use of the ramp.\n\n==Routes==\n{{anchor|Waterfront|SL1|SL2|SL3|SLW}}\n\n===Waterfront: SL1, SL2, SL3===\n{{MBTA Silver Line Waterfront}}\nThree Silver Line services operate from {{bts|South Station Under}} in a dedicated tunnel, the South Boston Piers Transitway, serving the underground {{bts|Courthouse}} and {{bts|World Trade Center}} stations in the [[Seaport District]] then splitting at the {{bts|Silver Line Way}} surface station.\n\n* '''SL1''' Logan Airport \u2013 South Station\n* '''SL2''' Design Center \u2013 South Station\n* '''SL3''' Chelsea \u2013 South Station\nDuring rush hours, additional [[short turn]]s (designated '''SLW''') are run between South Station and Silver Line Way to increase frequency in the Transitway.\n\nRoute SL2 runs on Northern Avenue, then on a one-way loop on Drydock Avenue and Black Falcon Avenue with multiple stops serving the Innovation and Design Building and the [[Port of Boston|Flynn Cruiseport Boston]]. Buses run clockwise around the loop, with a layover at Design Center Place in the morning and 23 Dry Dock Avenue in the afternoon. From Silver Line Way, route SL1 and SL3 buses loop backwards on Haul Road, then cross under [[Boston Harbor]] in the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] to [[East Boston]]. Route SL1 loops around the [[Logan International Airport]] terminals, with stops at the arrivals level of each terminal (including two separate stops at lengthy Terminal B). Route SL3 serves {{bts|Airport}} station, follows the Coughlin Bypass Road, and crosses [[Chelsea Creek]] on the [[Chelsea Street Bridge]]. It then follows a dedicated busway to {{bts|Chelsea}}, with intermediate stops at {{bts|Eastern Avenue}}, {{bts|Box District}}, and {{bts|Bellingham Square}}.<ref name=busmap /><ref name=netransit /> The three Transitway stops are full rapid transit stations; the Chelsea busway stations have large concrete shelters, while most other surface stops have small shelters.<ref name=2007report />{{rp|10}}\n\nThe Waterfront routes have regular rapid transit fares.<ref name=tariff />{{rp|13}} Passengers enter through faregates at the three Transitway stations, and pay at the on-board farebox at all other stops.<ref name=2007report />{{rp|12}} Fares are free when boarding at the Logan Airport stops.<ref name=tariff />{{rp|31}} (Inbound SL3 fares in Chelsea are also temporarily free during the Tobin Bridge/Chelsea Curves Rehabilitation Project, which is expected to last until late 2020.)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mass.gov/info-details/about-the-tobin-bridgechelsea-curves-rehabilitation-project |title=About the Tobin Bridge/Chelsea Curves Rehabilitation Project |year=2019 |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation}}</ref> Transfer is possible to the Red Line within fare control at South Station.

It is operated as part of the [[MBTA Bus]] system, but branded as [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) as part of the [[MBTA subway]] system. Six routes are operated as part of two disconnected corridors. {{As of|2019}}, weekday ridership on the Silver Line was 39,000.\n\nThe four Waterfront routes operate out of an underground terminal at {{bts|South Station Under}} and run through the South Boston Piers Transitway - a dedicated bus tunnel through the [[Seaport District]] with stations at {{bts|Courthouse}} and {{bts|World Trade Center}} . At {{bts|Silver Line Way}}, they fan out on the surface: the SL1 to [[Logan International Airport]], the SL2 to [[Boston Marine Industrial Park|Design Center]], and the SL3 to {{bts|Chelsea}} via [[East Boston]]. (An additional [[short turn]] route, SLW, runs only at peak hours between South Station and Silver Line Way.) The SL1 and SL3 operate in [[mixed traffic]] through the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]]; the SL3 uses a limited-access [[haul road]] in East Boston and a dedicated busway in Chelsea for part of its route. The SL2 operates in mixed traffic in the Seaport. The Waterfront routes use [[articulated buses|articulated]] [[dual-mode bus]]es that operate as electric [[trolleybus]]es in the Transitway and conventional diesel buses on the surface. Battery electric buses and a diesel hybrid bus with extended battery range are being tested; one of the types may ultimately replace the dual-mode buses.\n\nTwo routes operate on [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]] between [[Dudley Square station]] (at [[Nubian Square]] in [[Roxbury (Boston)|Roxbury]]) and [[Downtown Boston]]. The SL5 terminates at {{bts|Downtown Crossing}} and the SL4 on the surface at {{bts|South Station Under}}. The two routes operate mostly in [[bus lane|dedicated lanes]] on Washington Street and Essex Street, though sections in Downtown Boston and Nubian Square operate in mixed traffic. They use articulated diesel hybrid buses, which replaced [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG)-powered buses in 2016\u201317.\n\nThe Washington Street corridor was built to replace the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] [[rapid transit]] line, which was moved from the [[Washington Street Elevated]] to the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] in 1987. Initial plans called for a [[light rail]] line operated as part of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]], but trolleybuses and later CNG buses were substituted. Service improvements to the route 49 bus began in 2001, and the Silver Line brand was introduced on July 20, 2002. The articulated CNG buses began operation in 2003. On October 13, 2009, the SL4 began service and the original route was designated SL5.\n\nPlanning began in 1987 for mass transit to serve the growing Seaport; a new transit tunnel called the South Boston Piers Transitway was chosen in 1989. It was to run from {{bts|Boylston}} to World Trade Center via {{bts|Chinatown}} and South Station, though the Boylston-South Station section was later deferred as a separate phase. After years of delays, service through the $624 million Transitway began on December 17, 2004. SL2 and SL3 service began on December 31, 2004, with the SL1 added on June 1, 2005. The original SL3 route to {{bts|City Point}} was discontinued on March 20, 2009. A separate SL3 route to Chelsea \u2014 originally planned as part of the cancelled [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring Project]] \u2013 began service on April 21, 2018.\n\nIn 1999, the MBTA designated the Washington Street and Transitway projects as the Silver Line, and planned for the Boylston tunnel extension to include a portal to Washington Street for through-running. The connecting tunnel from Washington Street to Boylston was designated as Phase III. After several design changes, by 2005 Phase III was expected to cost around $800 million; projected completion had been delayed from 2006 to 2010, then to 2013. The project was placed on hold in 2005; planning resumed in 2006 after the controversial portal was relocated. However, the project cost rose to $2.1 billion, and it was cancelled in 2010. Several other Silver Line extensions have been proposed, as has a conversion of the Washington Street corridor to light rail, but most have not been pursued.\n\nThe Silver Line has been the target of criticism by riders and transportation planners. The choice of buses rather than light rail on Washington Street was viewed by Roxbury residents as a deliberate slight, leading to the nickname of \"The Silver Lie.\" Much of the Silver Line is missing [[BRT Standard]] features such as enforced dedicated lanes, off-vehicle fare collection, sheltered stations, and [[transit signal priority]]; a 2011 report by the [[Institute for Transportation and Development Policy]] (ITDP) called the Silver Line \"Not BRT\". Because the Transitway was not originally designed for service to Logan Airport or Chelsea, it does not have a direct connection to the Ted Williams Tunnel. A normally-unused ramp would shorten the outbound routing by {{convert|0.7|miles}}; after years of controversy, [[MassDOT]] agreed in 2019 to allow limited use of the ramp.\n\n==Routes==\n{{anchor|Waterfront|SL1|SL2|SL3|SLW}}\n\n===Waterfront: SL1, SL2, SL3===\n{{MBTA Silver Line Waterfront}}\nThree Silver Line services operate from {{bts|South Station Under}} in a dedicated tunnel, the South Boston Piers Transitway, serving the underground {{bts|Courthouse}} and {{bts|World Trade Center}} stations in the [[Seaport District]] then splitting at the {{bts|Silver Line Way}} surface station.\n\n* '''SL1''' Logan Airport \u2013 South Station\n* '''SL2''' Design Center \u2013 South Station\n* '''SL3''' Chelsea \u2013 South Station\nDuring rush hours, additional [[short turn]]s (designated '''SLW''') are run between South Station and Silver Line Way to increase frequency in the Transitway.\n\nRoute SL2 runs on Northern Avenue, then on a one-way loop on Drydock Avenue and Black Falcon Avenue with multiple stops serving the Innovation and Design Building and the [[Port of Boston|Flynn Cruiseport Boston]]. Buses run clockwise around the loop, with a layover at Design Center Place in the morning and 23 Dry Dock Avenue in the afternoon. From Silver Line Way, route SL1 and SL3 buses loop backwards on Haul Road, then cross under [[Boston Harbor]] in the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] to [[East Boston]]. Route SL1 loops around the [[Logan International Airport]] terminals, with stops at the arrivals level of each terminal (including two separate stops at lengthy Terminal B). Route SL3 serves {{bts|Airport}} station, follows the Coughlin Bypass Road, and crosses [[Chelsea Creek]] on the [[Chelsea Street Bridge]].

In May of that year he joined the ''Wizard of Oz'' show-case in Los Angeles where he performed alongside Tina Arena and other Australian artists. In July, Price released his debut album, ''Heaven Knows'', entered the ARIA Albums Chart at No.&nbsp;3 and stayed in the Top&nbsp;40 chart for nine&nbsp;weeks \u2013 it returned to the Top&nbsp;40 in May of the following year.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/>\n\nAustralian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], described the album as \"a well-crafted blend of radio-friendly Adult Oriented Rock (AOR), pop and soul material\" where Price had used \"hot US session players who had collectively worked with everyone from [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] to [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It had also been produced by Lord-Alge.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Price explained to Nicole Leedham of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', \"I could have made the album earlier but I didn't want to go ahead and sign the wrong deal, that can really destroy an artist's career.

He then made a 36-hour stopover in [[Metro Manila|Manila]] where he made six TV appearances, two radio interviews and a handful of press.\n\n\"Heaven Knows\" held the top spot in Malaysia for four consecutive weeks while \"Not a Day Goes By\" sat just behind it in the Top 5. In the Philippines, \"Heaven Knows\" sat at number 1 for all of November and December. During this time the album sold over 250,000 units alone in Southeast Asia. Price went on to say, \"It was an exhausting experience, but it was stimulating at the same time. It was all new to me, going to places I'd never been and doing stuff I'd never done, so I certainly didn't get tired of it.\"\n\n===1993\u20131994: Touring and recognition===\nIn January and February 1993, Price once again toured Australia to sold-out venues. In April, he was nominated for 3 [[ARIA Awards]] and on the night performed a tribute to [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] with \"[[Tenterfield Saddler]]\". Later in May, he was asked to perform the song on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' who were in Australia for 2 weeks. The performance was aired to 5 million people. Later that month ''Heaven Knows'' was re-released and included the bonus CD ''Rarities''. Rick spent 2 weeks travelling the country and promoting the re-release performing in acoustic mode.\n\nIn July 1993, ''Heaven Knows'' was released in America and Canada. Back home, Price continued his touring, this time in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland area which he had not previously performed in. The tour was extremely successful, with all shows being theatres and all sold out.\n\nDuring October 1993, Rick performed more concerts in Southeast Asia which incorporated 7 shows in 9 days. They were all sell outs. The [[Sentosa]] Music Festival in [[Singapore]] saw Rick perform in front of 15,000 people. Before returning to Australia, Rick visited Korea for a short promotional and concert tour.\n\nPrice once again joined the ''Wizard of Oz'' show cases in Japan where the album was launched. Whilst in Japan Rick won Song of the Year for \"[[Walk Away Renee]]\" and Album of the Year for ''Heaven Knows'' at the Australian Music Awards. On his return from Japan, Rick was awarded with the 1993 Australian Export Award for recognition of his international success. During the month a new single \"[[Where Is the Love (Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song)# Rick Price and Margaret Urlich version|Where Is the Love]]\", a duet with New Zealand musician [[Margaret Urlich]], was released.\n\nIn December 1993, Price was invited to the Singapore Music Awards as a special guest. He picked up Song of the Year for \"Heaven Knows\", then came back home to Australia for more touring before being invited to perform on the numerous [[Carols by Candlelight]] shows around the country and performing \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\". The year was topped off when Price was presented with an Advance Australia Foundation award (in recognition of making an outstanding contribution to the growth and enhancement of Australia and its people)\n\nDuring 1994, Price spent the majority of time writing material for his anticipated follow-up album. From September to December, Price recorded his second album in Melbourne with a host of Australia's leading musicians.\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''Tamborine Mountain''===\n{{Main|Tamborine Mountain (album)}}\nIn April 1995, the long-awaited single \"[[River of Love (Rick Price song)|River of Love]]\" was released, the first from Price's album ''Tamborine Mountain'', which was later released in July. \"It was quite difficult\", Price reveals, \"because I knew it was going to be a different album to ''Heaven Knows''. I made that album as pop as I could make it, I wanted to be certain of airplay and all those kind of things. After the first album was released, I went out and played a lot of acoustic gigs. My audience tripled and people really liked it, which surprised me because I thought it would be a bit too internal, a bit too self conscious. But it worked, which gave me a lot of encouragement and the confidence to write more like that, just simple little stories. And that's the kind of music I've always been drawn to - people like [[James Taylor]] and [[Carole King]], great songwriters who have the ability to say something really simple\".\n\nThe album was produced by Price and American Ben Wisch, who Price was drawn to as a result of his production of [[Marc Cohn]]'s \"[[Walking in Memphis]]\". Special guests on the album include Tommy Emmanuel on guitar and Tina Arena on backing vocals and the duet \"Trust Me This Is Love\".\n\nAfter the success of the first single \"River of Love\", a second single \"Bridge Building Man\" was released. The song is a standout track for Price, written for his father and grandfather. The album title itself is a reference to a small town near [[Beaudesert, Queensland|Beaudesert]] where Price grew up.\n\nIn November and December 1995, following the release of the album, Price then toured with Australia's legendary guitarist Tommy Emmanuel. The tour, Rick Price & Tommy Emmanuel - Together & Alone, was a sell-out. It received rave reviews from critics and the public alike.\n\nIn conjunction with the tour, a third single \"To Be with You\" was released in Australia. Price performed at several Carols by Candlelight shows around the country and continued to tour during early 1996. \"You're Never Alone\", a song Price wrote for his son, was released in Australia while he travelled the country on further promotional tours throughout the remainder of the year.\n\n===1997\u20132003: ''Another Place'' and ''A Million Miles''===\n{{Main|Another Place (Rick Price album)}}\nIn January and February 1997, Price played several shows alongside another accomplished Australian singer/songwriter, Jack Jones. The shows were a huge success with the pair performing their best hits together and alone, proving yet again their abilities as live performers.\n\nFor the majority of the year, Price spent his time in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] writing material for his next album.\n\nSome of the collaborators Price has worked with included Steve Werfel and Pam Reswick on \"Not a Day Goes By\" (who has written songs such as \"[[Chains (Tina Arena song)|Chains]]\" by Tina Arena), [[Jon Lind]] (who has written songs such as \"[[Simple Life (John Farnham song)|Simple Life]]\" by [[John Farnham]], and \"[[Crazy for You (Madonna song)|Crazy for You]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]), and [[Randy Goodrum]], a well-respected writer from Nashville. He has also written with Australia's Heather Field who co-wrote \"Heaven Knows\" and \"River of Love\", and once again has worked with Phil Buckle who co-wrote \"What's Wrong With That Girl\" from Rick's ''Heaven Knows'' album.\n\nIn November and December 1997, Price played a couple of showcases to the public with some of the new material he had been working on. During the later months of 1997 and early 1998, Price recorded his new album in Los Angeles. The album ''Another Place'' was released in Australia in July 1999, spanning singles including \"Where in the World\" and \"Good As Gone\". In 2003, parting with Sony, Price released another solo album, ''A Million Miles'', on his own label Clarice. Described as a garage album and going back to his musical roots, he plays every instrument heard on the album.\n\n===2004\u20132011: ''2UP'' and ''Revisited'' and \"John Denver\" tour===\nPrice has spent much of his time writing with, and recording and producing for other artists such as [[Melinda Schneider]], Tamara Stewart, [[Lisa Chappell]] and [[David Franj]]. In 2004, a \"best of\" CD and DVD was released, containing all of Price's bigger hits. In 2007 Price recorded an album with [[Mitch Grainger]] called ''2UP'', featuring acoustic-style covers of such artists as [[Chris Isaac]], and was featured in the soundtrack to the film ''[[December Boys]]''. In 2008, ''Revisited'', an album of his greatest hits recorded in an \"intimate acoustic style\", was released. He toured Tasmania with band Invisible Boy at the year's conclusion.  In 2009, after having relocated to Nashville, Price toured the US with Australian guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel, before returning to Australia and touring in a legacy show to singer-songwriter [[John Denver]], with \"The John Denver Story\".\n\n===2011\u20132016: ''The Waters Edge'' and ''Tennessee Sky''===\n{{Main|The Water's Edge|Tennessee Sky}}\nPrice, having relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 2009 toured the US with  guitarist Tommy Emmanuel \nAn album titled ''The Water's Edge'' was released in 2011, featuring the single \"Shape of My Heart\". and \"I'm Coming Home\" as the second single release in 2012.

He then made a 36-hour stopover in [[Metro Manila|Manila]] where he made six TV appearances, two radio interviews and a handful of press.\n\n\"Heaven Knows\" held the top spot in Malaysia for four consecutive weeks while \"Not a Day Goes By\" sat just behind it in the Top 5. In the Philippines, \"Heaven Knows\" sat at number 1 for all of November and December. During this time the album sold over 250,000 units alone in Southeast Asia. Price went on to say, \"It was an exhausting experience, but it was stimulating at the same time. It was all new to me, going to places I'd never been and doing stuff I'd never done, so I certainly didn't get tired of it.\"\n\n===1993\u20131994: Touring and recognition===\nIn January and February 1993, Price once again toured Australia to sold-out venues. In April, he was nominated for 3 [[ARIA Awards]] and on the night performed a tribute to [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] with \"[[Tenterfield Saddler]]\". Later in May, he was asked to perform the song on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' who were in Australia for 2 weeks. The performance was aired to 5 million people. Later that month ''Heaven Knows'' was re-released and included the bonus CD ''Rarities''. Rick spent 2 weeks travelling the country and promoting the re-release performing in acoustic mode.\n\nIn July 1993, ''Heaven Knows'' was released in America and Canada. Back home, Price continued his touring, this time in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland area which he had not previously performed in. The tour was extremely successful, with all shows being theatres and all sold out.\n\nDuring October 1993, Rick performed more concerts in Southeast Asia which incorporated 7 shows in 9 days. They were all sell outs. The [[Sentosa]] Music Festival in [[Singapore]] saw Rick perform in front of 15,000 people. Before returning to Australia, Rick visited Korea for a short promotional and concert tour.\n\nPrice once again joined the ''Wizard of Oz'' show cases in Japan where the album was launched. Whilst in Japan Rick won Song of the Year for \"[[Walk Away Renee]]\" and Album of the Year for ''Heaven Knows'' at the Australian Music Awards. On his return from Japan, Rick was awarded with the 1993 Australian Export Award for recognition of his international success.During the month a new single \"[[Where Is the Love (Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song)# Rick Price and Margaret Urlich version|Where Is the Love]]\", a duet with New Zealand musician [[Margaret Urlich]], was released.\n\nIn December 1993, Price was invited to the Singapore Music Awards as a special guest. He picked up Song of the Year for \"Heaven Knows\", then came back home to Australia for more touring before being invited to perform on the numerous [[Carols by Candlelight]] shows around the country and performing \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\". The year was topped off when Price was presented with an Advance Australia Foundation award (in recognition of making an outstanding contribution to the growth and enhancement of Australia and its people)\n\nDuring 1994, Price spent the majority of time writing material for his anticipated follow-up album. From September to December, Price recorded his second album in Melbourne with a host of Australia's leading musicians.\n\n===1995\u20131996: ''Tamborine Mountain''===\n{{Main|Tamborine Mountain (album)}}\nIn April 1995, the long-awaited single \"[[River of Love (Rick Price song)|River of Love]]\" was released, the first from Price's album ''Tamborine Mountain'', which was later released in July. \"It was quite difficult\", Price reveals, \"because I knew it was going to be a different album to ''Heaven Knows''. I made that album as pop as I could make it, I wanted to be certain of airplay and all those kind of things. After the first album was released, I went out and played a lot of acoustic gigs. My audience tripled and people really liked it, which surprised me because I thought it would be a bit too internal, a bit too self conscious. But it worked, which gave me a lot of encouragement and the confidence to write more like that, just simple little stories. And that's the kind of music I've always been drawn to - people like [[James Taylor]] and [[Carole King]], great songwriters who have the ability to say something really simple\".\n\nThe album was produced by Price and American Ben Wisch, who Price was drawn to as a result of his production of [[Marc Cohn]]'s \"[[Walking in Memphis]]\". Special guests on the album include Tommy Emmanuel on guitar and Tina Arena on backing vocals and the duet \"Trust Me This Is Love\".\n\nAfter the success of the first single \"River of Love\", a second single \"Bridge Building Man\" was released. The song is a standout track for Price, written for his father and grandfather. The album title itself is a reference to a small town near [[Beaudesert, Queensland|Beaudesert]] where Price grew up.\n\nIn November and December 1995, following the release of the album, Price then toured with Australia's legendary guitarist Tommy Emmanuel. The tour, Rick Price & Tommy Emmanuel - Together & Alone, was a sell-out. It received rave reviews from critics and the public alike.\n\nIn conjunction with the tour, a third single \"To Be with You\" was released in Australia. Price performed at several Carols by Candlelight shows around the country and continued to tour during early 1996. \"You're Never Alone\", a song Price wrote for his son, was released in Australia while he travelled the country on further promotional tours throughout the remainder of the year.\n\n===1997\u20132003: ''Another Place'' and ''A Million Miles''===\n{{Main|Another Place (Rick Price album)}}\nIn January and February 1997, Price played several shows alongside another accomplished Australian singer/songwriter, Jack Jones. The shows were a huge success with the pair performing their best hits together and alone, proving yet again their abilities as live performers.\n\nFor the majority of the year, Price spent his time in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] writing material for his next album.\n\nSome of the collaborators Price has worked with included Steve Werfel and Pam Reswick on \"Not a Day Goes By\" (who has written songs such as \"[[Chains (Tina Arena song)|Chains]]\" by Tina Arena), [[Jon Lind]] (who has written songs such as \"[[Simple Life (John Farnham song)|Simple Life]]\" by [[John Farnham]], and \"[[Crazy for You (Madonna song)|Crazy for You]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]), and [[Randy Goodrum]], a well-respected writer from Nashville. He has also written with Australia's Heather Field who co-wrote \"Heaven Knows\" and \"River of Love\", and once again has worked with Phil Buckle who co-wrote \"What's Wrong With That Girl\" from Rick's ''Heaven Knows'' album.\n\nIn November and December 1997, Price played a couple of showcases to the public with some of the new material he had been working on. During the later months of 1997 and early 1998, Price recorded his new album in Los Angeles. The album ''Another Place'' was released in Australia in July 1999, spanning singles including \"Where in the World\" and \"Good As Gone\". In 2003, parting with Sony, Price released another solo album, ''A Million Miles'', on his own label Clarice. Described as a garage album and going back to his musical roots, he plays every instrument heard on the album.\n\n===2004\u20132011: ''2UP'' and ''Revisited'' and \"John Denver\" tour===\nPrice has spent much of his time writing with, and recording and producing for other artists such as [[Melinda Schneider]], Tamara Stewart, [[Lisa Chappell]] and [[David Franj]]. In 2004, a \"best of\" CD and DVD was released, containing all of Price's bigger hits. In 2007 Price recorded an album with [[Mitch Grainger]] called ''2UP'', featuring acoustic-style covers of such artists as [[Chris Isaac]], and was featured in the soundtrack to the film ''[[December Boys]]''. In 2008, ''Revisited'', an album of his greatest hits recorded in an \"intimate acoustic style\", was released. He toured Tasmania with band Invisible Boy at the year's conclusion.  In 2009, after having relocated to Nashville, Price toured the US with Australian guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel, before returning to Australia and touring in a legacy show to singer-songwriter [[John Denver]], with \"The John Denver Story\".\n\n===2011\u20132016: ''The Waters Edge'' and ''Tennessee Sky''===\n{{Main|The Water's Edge|Tennessee Sky}}\nPrice, having relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 2009 toured the US with  guitarist Tommy Emmanuel \nAn album titled ''The Water's Edge'' was released in 2011, featuring the single \"Shape of My Heart\". and \"I'm Coming Home\" as the second single release in 2012.
