The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars [[Danielle Savre]], [[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]], [[Tobin Bell]] and [[Renee O'Connor]]. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]], and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one.\n\nDue to the previous film's financial success, ''Boogeyman 2'' was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December of the same year with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] at the former hospital, [[Linda Vista Community Hospital]], over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural being, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.\n\nAfter screening at the [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] on October 20, 2007, ''Boogeyman 2'' was released [[direct-to-video]] in the United States on January 8, 2008; it was later released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered it to be a general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary [[Creature Features|creature features]], including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, ''[[Boogeyman 3]]'', the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nAs young children Laura Porter and her brother Henry witness their parents' brutal murder by a hooded man, whom they believe to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]. As an adult, Henry has attended group therapy, improving such that he is instead currently looking for work. Laura joins this group as he leaves, meeting the other members: [[Nyctophobia|nyctophobic]] Mark, [[Germaphobia|germaphobic]] Paul, [[Self-harm|masochistic]] Alison, [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and commitment-averse Darren, and Nicky, a [[bulimic]] girl who fears extreme weight gain.\n\nUpon her joining, however, the members of the group are targeted and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.\n\nDr. Ryan goes to the basement to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother and those of other patients with bogyphobia ([[phobia]] of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is [[Hallucination|hallucinating]]. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.\n\nLaura finds Nicky on a basement table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; along the way she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet in an attempt to treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is framed for the murders and arrested.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the Boogeyman looks at a picture of Laura and Henry as adults before disappearing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Danielle Savre]] as Laura Porter\n* [[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]] as Henry Porter\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as Dr. Mitchell Allen\n* [[Renee O'Connor]] as Dr. Jessica Ryan\n* Chrissy Griffith as Nicky\n* [[Michael Graziadei]] as Darren\n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Alison\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Paul\n* [[David Gallagher]] as Mark\n* [[Lesli Margherita]] as Gloria\n* [[Tom Lenk]] as Perry\n* [[Sammi Hanratty]] as Young Laura Porter\n* Jarrod Bailey as Young Henry Porter\n* Lucas Fleischer as Mr. Porter\n* Suzanne Jamieson as Mrs. Porter\n* Christopher John Fields as Detective\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and filming===\n[[File:Boogeyman 2 - Boogie Mask.jpg<!-- Don't resize non-free images per WP:NFCCP -->|thumb|right|Evolution of the killer's mask, dubbed \"Boogie Mask\", throughout various stages of development.

The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars [[Danielle Savre]], [[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]], [[Tobin Bell]] and [[Renee O'Connor]]. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]], and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one.\n\nDue to the previous film's financial success, ''Boogeyman 2'' was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December of the same year with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] at the former hospital, [[Linda Vista Community Hospital]], over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural being, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.\n\nAfter screening at the [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] on October 20, 2007, ''Boogeyman 2'' was released [[direct-to-video]] in the United States on January 8, 2008; it was later released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered it to be a general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary [[Creature Features|creature features]], including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, ''[[Boogeyman 3]]'', the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nAs young children Laura Porter and her brother Henry witness their parents' brutal murder by a hooded man, whom they believe to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]. As an adult, Henry has attended group therapy, improving such that he is instead currently looking for work. Laura joins this group as he leaves, meeting the other members: [[Nyctophobia|nyctophobic]] Mark, [[Germaphobia|germaphobic]] Paul, [[Self-harm|masochistic]] Alison, [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and commitment-averse Darren, and Nicky, a [[bulimic]] girl who fears extreme weight gain.\n\nUpon her joining, however, the members of the group are targeted and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.\n\nDr. Ryan goes to the basement to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother and those of other patients with bogyphobia ([[phobia]] of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is [[Hallucination|hallucinating]]. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.\n\nLaura finds Nicky on a basement table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; along the way she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet in an attempt to treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is framed for the murders and arrested.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the Boogeyman looks at a picture of Laura and Henry as adults before disappearing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Danielle Savre]] as Laura Porter\n* [[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]] as Henry Porter\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as Dr. Mitchell Allen\n* [[Renee O'Connor]] as Dr. Jessica Ryan\n* Chrissy Griffith as Nicky\n* [[Michael Graziadei]] as Darren\n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Alison\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Paul\n* [[David Gallagher]] as Mark\n* [[Lesli Margherita]] as Gloria\n* [[Tom Lenk]] as Perry\n* [[Sammi Hanratty]] as Young Laura Porter\n* Jarrod Bailey as Young Henry Porter\n* Lucas Fleischer as Mr. Porter\n* Suzanne Jamieson as Mrs. Porter\n* Christopher John Fields as Detective\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and filming===\n[[File:Boogeyman 2 - Boogie Mask.jpg<!-- Don't resize non-free images per WP:NFCCP -->|thumb|right|Evolution of the killer's mask, dubbed \"Boogie Mask\", throughout various stages of development.

Under the supervision of The Director, Jardani was trained as an assassin; he learned multiple skills including [[martial arts]], firearms, edged weapons, improvised weapons, tactical driving, infiltration, [[escapology]] and more. At some point Jardani took the name \"John Wick\" and left the Ruska Roma. He became a feared and ruthless [[contract killing|hitman]] his targets would call \"[[Baba Yaga]]\". Wick was noted for his great focus and determination; his fighting prowess was such that he once single-handedly killed three men with a pencil. Eventually John met a woman named Helen and [[Falling in love|fell in love]]. Hoping to leave his past as a contract killer behind him and pursue a normal life, John met with crime boss Viggo Tarasov, who agreed to grant him his wish if he could accomplish a task described as \"impossible\" by others. In order to accomplish this task John required assistance from [[Camorra]] member Santino D'Antonio and subsequently ended up owing a blood debt to him. Viggo Tarasov said the killings Wick performed laid the foundations for what his criminal organization became, implying Wick eliminated all his major rivals for him. After completing his \"impossible task,\" John Wick retired as an assassin and settled down with his wife Helen.\n\n===''John Wick''===\n{{Main page|John Wick (film)}}\nFollowing his wife's terminal illness, John prefers to remain isolated from society. He spends his days driving his prized car \u2014 a 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]] \u2014 and caring for his new dog, Daisy, the last gift from his dearly departed wife. This changes when Iosef Tarasov assaults John, steals his car and kills Daisy. This sets John on a rampage of slaughter and vengeance. Attempting to protect his son from John's rampage, Viggo sends assassins to stop John, but all are killed. Eventually John takes his revenge, killing both Iosef and Viggo. After he does this, John rescues a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized from an [[animal shelter]].\n\n===''John Wick: Chapter 2''===\n{{Main page|John Wick: Chapter 2}}\nAfter exacting his vengeance on the Tarasovs, John retrieves his prized car from Abram Tarasov and forms a truce with him allowing him to live. John hopes to return to retirement but this is interrupted by Santino D'Antonio, who asks for him to complete his blood oath and assassinate his sister, Gianna, allowing Santino to have a seat at The High Table. Wick reluctantly travels to Rome to fulfill the task, only to realize that he will be Santino's next target for eliminating a member of The High Table. Santino sends his bodyguard Ares and Gianna's former bodyguard Cassian after Wick but both ultimately fail. Santino places a $7 million bounty on Wick's head, after which Wick enlists assistance from The Bowery King, who supplies him with a gun that carries only 7 bullets and information of Santino's location. John eventually finds Santino in the safe grounds of The Continental. Santino taunts John as The Continental Owner, Winston, advises John to walk away before he breaks the laws of The Continental. Despite this, John still assassinates Santino, leaving John to be declared \"excommunicado\" for conducting business on Continental Grounds. Winston allows John one hour to escape before the contract is doubled and his status is rescinded from all services.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/05/20/john-wick-chapter-4-keanu-reeves-fourth-movie-coming/3748121002/ |title='John Wick 4' underway, but don't expect a happy ending for Keanu Reeves |first=Bryan |last=Alexander |date=May 24, 2019 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |language=en |accessdate=September 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum''===\n{{Main page|John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum}}\nExcommunicated, exhausted, and injured, John spends his one-hour head start preparing to flee from New York, as assassins gather and hear word of the bounty on John for killing a member of the High Table. John escapes to Morocco, meets with former ally Sofia, and calls in a favor to be brought to the Elder, a man above the High Table, who can clear the bounty. John travels the desert to the point of collapse in order for The Elder to find him. The Elder agrees to grant him forgiveness from the bounty in return for killing Winston and serving the High Table for the rest of his life; John severs his ring finger and offers his wedding ring to The Elder to show his commitment. John returns to New York and is pursued by assassins until he reaches the safe haven of the Continental. John reunites with Winston but decides not to kill him. Instead John and the hotel's concierge Charon make a stand against the High Table and their enforcers. Successfully defeating waves of attackers, Winston and High Table representative The Adjudicator parley on the hotel roof. Ultimately, Winston shoots John to restore his standing with the High Table and John tumbles from the roof into the street.

He is portrayed by [[Keanu Reeves]]. The character of John Wick, originally named '''Jardani Jovonovich''', is an assassin who has long retired, until a gang invades his house, steals his car and kills his dog, setting him on a near unstoppable path of revenge, after which a former colleague (William Legg) calls in a \"marker\" to have him fulfill an assassination leading to him being pursued by the entirety of the High Table of Assassins.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insider.com/how-keanu-reeves-learned-to-shoot-guns-2019-7 |title=How Keanu Reeves learned to shoot guns for 'John Wick' |first1=Joe |last1=Avella |first2=Conner |last2=Blake |date=August 13, 2019 |website=Insider |language=en |accessdate=September 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nJohn Wick was once named Jardani Jovonovich, born in former Soviet Russia to parents who were of Romani, Russian, Ukrainian and [[Koryo saram]] descent. He was orphaned at a young age for unknown reasons before taken in by his father's old friend, who would eventually become his mentor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2019/05/john-wick-3-review/ |title=John Wick 3 Isn't Just About Fighting, It's About Fame and Fandom |first=Will |last=Gottsegen |date=May 20, 2019 |website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> He was adopted by the [[Ruska Roma]] organization from [[Belarus]] and raised by their leader ''The Director'' in their New York headquarters. Under the supervision of The Director, Jardani was trained as an assassin; he learned multiple skills including [[martial arts]], firearms, edged weapons, improvised weapons, tactical driving, infiltration, [[escapology]] and more. At some point Jardani took the name \"John Wick\" and left the Ruska Roma. He became a feared and ruthless [[contract killing|hitman]] his targets would call \"[[Baba Yaga]]\". Wick was noted for his great focus and determination; his fighting prowess was such that he once single-handedly killed three men with a pencil. Eventually John met a woman named Helen and [[Falling in love|fell in love]]. Hoping to leave his past as a contract killer behind him and pursue a normal life, John met with crime boss Viggo Tarasov, who agreed to grant him his wish if he could accomplish a task described as \"impossible\" by others. In order to accomplish this task John required assistance from [[Camorra]] member Santino D'Antonio and subsequently ended up owing a blood debt to him. Viggo Tarasov said the killings Wick performed laid the foundations for what his criminal organization became, implying Wick eliminated all his major rivals for him. After completing his \"impossible task,\" John Wick retired as an assassin and settled down with his wife Helen.\n\n===''John Wick''===\n{{Main page|John Wick (film)}}\nFollowing his wife's terminal illness, John prefers to remain isolated from society. He spends his days driving his prized car \u2014 a 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]] \u2014 and caring for his new dog, Daisy, the last gift from his dearly departed wife. This changes when Iosef Tarasov assaults John, steals his car and kills Daisy. This sets John on a rampage of slaughter and vengeance. Attempting to protect his son from John's rampage, Viggo sends assassins to stop John, but all are killed. Eventually John takes his revenge, killing both Iosef and Viggo. After he does this, John rescues a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized from an [[animal shelter]].\n\n===''John Wick: Chapter 2''===\n{{Main page|John Wick: Chapter 2}}\nAfter exacting his vengeance on the Tarasovs, John retrieves his prized car from Abram Tarasov and forms a truce with him allowing him to live. John hopes to return to retirement but this is interrupted by Santino D'Antonio, who asks for him to complete his blood oath and assassinate his sister, Gianna, allowing Santino to have a seat at The High Table. Wick reluctantly travels to Rome to fulfill the task, only to realize that he will be Santino's next target for eliminating a member of The High Table. Santino sends his bodyguard Ares and Gianna's former bodyguard Cassian after Wick but both ultimately fail. Santino places a $7 million bounty on Wick's head, after which Wick enlists assistance from The Bowery King, who supplies him with a gun that carries only 7 bullets and information of Santino's location. John eventually finds Santino in the safe grounds of The Continental. Santino taunts John as The Continental Owner, Winston, advises John to walk away before he breaks the laws of The Continental. Despite this, John still assassinates Santino, leaving John to be declared \"excommunicado\" for conducting business on Continental Grounds. Winston allows John one hour to escape before the contract is doubled and his status is rescinded from all services.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/05/20/john-wick-chapter-4-keanu-reeves-fourth-movie-coming/3748121002/ |title='John Wick 4' underway, but don't expect a happy ending for Keanu Reeves |first=Bryan |last=Alexander |date=May 24, 2019 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |language=en |accessdate=September 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum''===\n{{Main page|John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum}}\nExcommunicated, exhausted, and injured, John spends his one-hour head start preparing to flee from New York, as assassins gather and hear word of the bounty on John for killing a member of the High Table. John escapes to Morocco, meets with former ally Sofia, and calls in a favor to be brought to the Elder, a man above the High Table, who can clear the bounty. John travels the desert to the point of collapse in order for The Elder to find him. The Elder agrees to grant him forgiveness from the bounty in return for killing Winston and serving the High Table for the rest of his life; John severs his ring finger and offers his wedding ring to The Elder to show his commitment. John returns to New York and is pursued by assassins until he reaches the safe haven of the Continental. John reunites with Winston but decides not to kill him. Instead John and the hotel's concierge Charon make a stand against the High Table and their enforcers. Successfully defeating waves of attackers, Winston and High Table representative The Adjudicator parley on the hotel roof. Ultimately, Winston shoots John to restore his standing with the High Table and John tumbles from the roof into the street.
