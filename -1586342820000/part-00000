A [[fossil]] of the single and [[type species]], ''B. taimyrensis'', has been discovered in [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] of the Early [[Devonian]] [[Period (geology)|period]] ([[Lochkovian]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]) in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]]. The name of the genus honors [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], an Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] who participated in many expeditions to [[Antarctica]]. ''Borchgrevinkium'' represents a poorly known genus whose affinities are uncertain.\n\nIt had several unique characteristics that differentiated it from many other arthropods, such as its long parabolic (nearly U-shaped) [[prosoma]] (head), its elongated first and second [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]] and the presence of paired \"ridges\" in the surface of its third to tenth [[tergite]]s ([[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] halves of the segments). Furthermore, the [[opisthosoma]] ([[Abdomen#Other animals|abdomen]]) of ''Borchgrevinkium'' was triangular, and its [[telson]] (\"tail\"), short and wedge-shaped. It was a small [[animal]], approximately {{convert|3|cm|abbr=off}} long.\n\nThe only known specimen of the genus was collected in 1956 and described in 1959 by the Russian paleontologist [[Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov]]. He determined that it was a [[eurypterid]] and classified it in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. However, its classification changed repeatedly over the years, being transferred from Eurypterida to [[Xiphosura]] and back to Eurypterida some time later. Nowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is tentatively considered as a [[prosomapod]], with more fossil material needed to ensure its current classification.\n\n== Description ==\nThe size of the only known specimen of ''Borchgrevinkium'', PIN 1271/1, is estimated more or less at {{convert|3|cm|abbr=off}}, making it a small [[arthropod]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|url=https://iris.univ-lille.fr/handle/1908/2214|title=M\u00e9rostomates du D\u00e9vonien inf\u00e9rieur et moyen de Sib\u00e9rie|first=Nestor I.|last=Novojilov|author-link=Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov|journal=Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9ologique du Nord|volume=78|language=fr|year=1959|pp=243\u2013258}}</ref>\n\nThe [[prosoma]] was longer than wider (covering one third of the length of the [[animal]]), parabolic (nearly U-shaped) and with a length of {{convert|1.35|cm|abbr=on}}. The [[Compound eye|eyes]] are not preserved and therefore, their position or shape is unknown. The prosomal [[Arthropod leg|appendages]] (limbs) are only known by the tip of poorly preserved left pairs. They were short, undifferentiated and [[Spine (zoology)|spiniferous]]. The [[opisthosoma]] ([[Abdomen#Other animals|abdomen]]) was triangular and {{convert|1.23|cm|abbr=on}} long. It was composed of 12 [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]], with the first one being exceptionally long and forming with the second segment an \"extension\" of the prosoma. The genital appendage (a [[ventral]] \"rod\" part of the [[reproductive system]]) of ''Borchgrevinkium'' was long, spanning from its first to its second segment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe third to tenth [[tergite]]s ([[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] halves of the segments) had [[distal]] (outwards-pointing) lobes on their sides that delimitated the dorsal and ventral parts of the opisthosoma. Furthermore, these tergites had on their surfaces converging paired \"folds\" or \"ridges\" that progressively narrowed to the center of the tenth tergite. These ridges were almost parallel to the [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] lobes. On the eleventh tergite, the edges were slightly curved. The pretelson (the segment that preceded the tail) had a bifid (divided into two lobes) dorsal projection. The [[telson]] (the \"tail\") was cuneiform (wedge-like), short and narrow, and measured {{convert|0.45|cm|abbr=on}}. The [[Biological ornament|ornamentation]] of the body was composed by short [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]] with broadly rounded edges.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History of research ==\n{{Location map|Russia Krasnoyarsk Krai\n|relief = yes\n|caption = Location of [[Norilsk]], city near of which the only known specimen of ''B. taimyrensis'' has been found (the exact location is unknown)\n|label = Norilsk\n|coordinates = {{coord|69|20|N|88|13|E|display=inline}}\n}}\nIn 1956, the Russian [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]] Vladimir Vasilyevich Menner discovered a series of [[fossil]]s in [[Devonian]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] near the [[Imangda River]] at the southwest of the [[Taymyr Peninsula]], near [[Norilsk]], in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] ([[Russia]], then the [[Soviet Union]]).

It was deposited in the [[Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], in [[Moscow]]. Novojilov considered it unique enough to be erected as a new [[genus]], ''Borchgrevinkium'', named after the Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] for his expeditions to [[Antarctica]]. He compared it with the then [[xiphosura]]n genus ''[[Weinbergina]]'', assuming that ''Borchgrevinkium'' was also a xiphosuran. However, the Norwegian paleontologist [[Leif St\u00f8rmer]], who assisted him during his study, noticed that what Novojilov had considered to be an accidental fissure was actually part of the \"macrosegment\" (the first segment), finding as well the tip of the appendages after closer examination. The presence of this macrosegment convinced Novojilov that ''Borchgrevinkium'' represented a new [[eurypterid]], more specifically one part of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. Afterwards, he compared it to the [[species]] ''[[Mycterops|Mycterops matthieui]]'' and ''[[Woodwardopterus|Woodwardopterus scabrosus]]'' (members of the family), without finding many similarities but still classifying ''Borchgrevinkium'' in the eurypterid group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was remitted to the family Woodwardopteridae together with ''Woodwardopterus'' in 1966 by the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering.

''Borchgrevinkium'' might belong to this clade as well.]]\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was originally described as a mycteroptid eurypterid by Novojilov, although he also noted a certain resemblance to ''Weinbergina'', especially for the paired \"ridges\" that both have on their tergites.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nowadays, his descriptions are considered inaccurate, inexhaustive and based only on the best preserved material.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the genus continued being considered by other authors as a eurypterid. In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified ''Borchgrevinkium'' with ''Woodwardopterus'' in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1972, St\u00f8rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the [[Order (biology)|order]] Xiphosura.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arthropods from the Lower Devonian (Lower Emsian) of Alken an der Mosel, Germany.

The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments.<ref name=\":5\" /> This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with [[Stylonurina]] and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda. It encomapasses all [[chelicerate]]s with prosomal uniramous appendages (appendages composed of a single series of [[Podomere|segments]] attached end-to-end) in the adult stage (excluding the sixth and last appendage). However, the appendages of ''Borchgrevinkium'' are poorly known.

The name of the genus honors [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], an Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] who participated in many expeditions to [[Antarctica]]. ''Borchgrevinkium'' represents a poorly known genus whose affinities are uncertain.\n\nIt had several unique characteristics that differentiated it from many other arthropods, such as its long parabolic (nearly U-shaped) [[prosoma]] (head), its elongated first and second [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]] and the presence of paired \"ridges\" in the surface of its third to tenth [[tergite]]s ([[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] halves of the segments).

He determined that it was a [[eurypterid]] and classified it in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. However, its classification changed repeatedly over the years, being transferred from Eurypterida to [[Xiphosura]] and back to Eurypterida some time later.

The prosomal [[Arthropod leg|appendages]] (limbs) are only known by the tip of poorly preserved left pairs. They were short, undifferentiated and [[Spine (zoology)|spiniferous]]. The [[opisthosoma]] ([[Abdomen#Other animals|abdomen]]) was triangular and {{convert|1.23|cm|abbr=on}} long.

These ridges were almost parallel to the [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] lobes. On the eleventh tergite, the edges were slightly curved. The pretelson (the segment that preceded the tail) had a bifid (divided into two lobes) dorsal projection. The [[telson]] (the \"tail\") was cuneiform (wedge-like), short and narrow, and measured {{convert|0.45|cm|abbr=on}}.

He compared it with the then [[xiphosura]]n genus ''[[Weinbergina]]'', assuming that ''Borchgrevinkium'' was also a xiphosuran. However, the Norwegian paleontologist [[Leif St\u00f8rmer]], who assisted him during his study, noticed that what Novojilov had considered to be an accidental fissure was actually part of the \"macrosegment\" (the first segment), finding as well the tip of the appendages after closer examination. The presence of this macrosegment convinced Novojilov that ''Borchgrevinkium'' represented a new [[eurypterid]], more specifically one part of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. Afterwards, he compared it to the [[species]] ''[[Mycterops|Mycterops matthieui]]'' and ''[[Woodwardopterus|Woodwardopterus scabrosus]]'' (members of the family), without finding many similarities but still classifying ''Borchgrevinkium'' in the eurypterid group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was remitted to the family Woodwardopteridae together with ''Woodwardopterus'' in 1966 by the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering.

In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified ''Borchgrevinkium'' with ''Woodwardopterus'' in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1972, St\u00f8rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the [[Order (biology)|order]] Xiphosura.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arthropods from the Lower Devonian (Lower Emsian) of Alken an der Mosel, Germany.

The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments.<ref name=\":5\" /> This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with [[Stylonurina]] and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda.

Since he has begun training as a paramedic, Jeevan tries to resuscitate Arthur but is unsuccessful. Instead, he comforts one of the child actors in the production, Kirsten. After leaving the play Jeevan goes for a walk in the snow and receives a call from one of his doctor friends. This friend warns him to get out of the city as a mysterious Georgian Flu is spreading rapidly and will soon become a full-blown pandemic. Jeevan loads up on supplies and goes to stay with his brother. Many of the actors, actresses, and others that had gathered to mourn Arthur's death die within three weeks of the beginning epidemic.\n\nTwenty years later, Kirsten Raymonde is part of a nomadic group of actors and musicians known as the Travelling Symphony. Kirsten, who was eight at the time of outbreak, can remember little of her life before Year Zero, but clings to a two-volume set of graphic novels given to her by Arthur before his death, called ''Dr. Eleven''. The troupe operates on a two-year cycle traveling around the [[Great Lakes region]], and during this time, Kirsten scavenges abandoned homes looking for old tabloid magazines for traces of Arthur. After returning to a small town where they left their pregnant friend, Charlie, and her husband, Jeremy, the troupe is disturbed to find that not only are their friends missing but the town is under the control of the mysterious prophet, who rapes young girls whom he claims as his \"wives\". The troupe quickly leaves and is determined to go off route to the Museum of Civilization, which is actually a former airport, where they believe they might find their missing friends. However, en route, they discover a young stowaway who left the town as she was promised to the prophet as his bride. Shortly after, members of the troupe begin to disappear until finally the entire troupe is gone, leaving only Kirsten and her friend August. Frightened, they continue on to the Museum hoping to be reunited with others.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kirsten, the graphic novel ''Dr. Eleven'' was written by Arthur's first wife, Miranda. Fourteen years before the collapse of civilization, Miranda left an abusive relationship with an artist and married Arthur. However, as Arthur's fame hit its peak Miranda realized he was having an affair with a blonde woman who would become his second wife, Elizabeth. The night that Miranda discovers the affair she walks out of her home and asks the paparazzo outside if he has a cigarette. The paparazzo turns out to be Jeevan. Years later, when Jeevan is trying to reinvent himself as an entertainment journalist, Arthur gives him the exclusive that he is leaving Elizabeth and his young child to be with Lydia Marks, the co-star of his new movie. Jeevan reflects on this while he and his brother Frank are locked in Frank's apartment waiting for the epidemic to run its course. After a while, they realize that no one is coming to save them. Frank, a paraplegic, commits suicide so Jeevan doesn't feel responsible for him. Jeevan embarks on a journey south and eventually finds a new settlement where he marries and becomes the town doctor.\n\nIn Year Zero, Clark, one of Arthur's friends, is the one who informs Elizabeth that Arthur is dead. Clark, Elizabeth and Elizabeth's son, Tyler, happen to be on the same flight from [[New York City]] to [[Toronto]] to attend Arthur's funeral when it is redirected to the fictional Severn City Airport due to the epidemic. Clark ends up resettling in the airport post-pandemic and becomes the \"curator\" of the Museum of Civilization, where he gathers artifacts such as [[IPhone|iPhones]] and laptop computers. While most of the airport survivors adapt to their new life, Elizabeth and Tyler embrace religious zealotry, believing that the epidemic happened for a reason and spared those who were good. They finally leave in Year Two with a religious cult.\n\nIn the present, Kirsten and August meet a group of the prophet's men along with Sayid, one of the members of their troupe. They manage to kill the men and free Sayid, who informs them that one of their friends, Dieter, was killed and that the hostage that the prophet's men took to replace Dieter managed to escape and warn the troupe, explaining how Kirsten and August were unable to find them. Frightened, Kirsten, August, and Sayid leave for Severn City Airport. Kirsten, however, is discovered by the prophet himself. Just before the prophet is about to kill her, he refers to the \"Undersea,\" a place from the ''Dr. Eleven'' comics. Kirsten quotes lines from ''Dr. Eleven'', distracting the prophet long enough that one of his younger sentries shoots and kills him before taking his own life. Kirsten and the rest continue on to the Museum of Civilization where they are reunited with Charlie, Jeremy and the rest of the troupe. Clark, who has stayed at the museum for twenty years, realizes who Kirsten is, her attachment to Arthur, and that the Prophet is the adult Tyler. Clark shows Kirsten from the watch tower of the airport that there is a town to the south that uses electricity, showing that civilization is beginning to take root again.\n\nFive weeks later, Kirsten leaves with the theatre troupe for the south. She leaves one volume of ''Dr. Eleven'' with Clark, who begins to read it and recognizes a scene in the graphic novel that is borrowed from a dinner party which he, Arthur and Miranda once attended.\n\n==Characters==\n*Kirsten Raymonde \u2013 A former child actor from [[Toronto]] who is eight when the Georgian flu destroys her world.

It is also called yarn storming, guerrilla knitting, kniffiti, urban knitting, or graffiti knitting.\n\n==Motivation==\nWhile yarn installations \u2013 called ''yarn bombs'' or ''yarnstorms'' \u2013 may last for years, they are considered non-permanent, and, unlike other forms of [[graffiti]], can be easily removed if necessary.

The company's Adaptive Automation<sup>TM</sup> product uses energy data gathered from the hardware combined with historical usage trends and weather data to predict future usage, and an algorithm enacts controls in the building to adjust usage in a way that reduces energy consumption and costs. The company cites one customer, [[Grand Hyatt San Francisco]], that was able to save 20% of the controlled load and earn a 40% [[Return on investment|ROI]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://verdigris.co/pdf/Grand-Hyatt-Adaptive-Automation.pdf|title=Grand Hyatt Automates Savings With Verdigris|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===== Forecasting & Alerts =====\nIn 2019, Verdigris announced a partnership with the multinational electrification company [[ABB Group|ABB]] to offer its machine learning algorithms to ABB customers. \"The Energy Forecasting app will enable users to reduce their electricity bills by reducing peak demand charges. The Intelligent Alerts<sup>TM</sup> app uses machine learning algorithms to help customers better manage their assets, identifying underlying issues before they become problems.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://new.abb.com/news/detail/41194/abb-uses-ai-to-revolutionize-energy-management|title=ABB uses AI to revolutionize energy management|website=new.abb.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===== API =====\nVerdigris offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] that enables customers to integrate energy data into enterprise databases or other building energy management systems or data analysis tools.\n\n== Services ==\n\n\u201cWe provide analytics and workflow automation to 24/7 facilities teams to improve operational efficiency, reduce equipment downtimes, and save on energy, delivered as a SaaS,\u201d said co-founder Thomas Chung to TechCrunch in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Verdigris takes $9M to power its AI energy consumption analytics b2b startup|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/verdigris-takes-9m-to-power-its-ai-energy-consumption-analytics-b2b-startup/|website=TechCrunch}}</ref>\n\nVerdigris smart sensors clamp onto electrical circuits to track a building's energy consumption and sends the data securely over Wi-Fi or Verizon 4G/LTE to the cloud. Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information than any other solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than utility smart meters every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to \u201clearn\u201d a building's equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data.\n\nVerdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model. It reads a building's energy usage in real time, and, combined with weather or building occupancy, produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption (kW).\n\nThe Verdigris system is certified for use in 38 countries including the United States, the European Union (32 countries), China, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Canada.\n\n==Company history==\nVerdigris co-founder and CEO Mark Chung came up with the idea for Verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill. The local utility could not provide Chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity. Chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters, hacked them to be wi-fi enabled, and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house. He found the problem, a broken pool pump, and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-23/silicon-valley-engineer-quest-green-world-making-buildings-smarter|title=A Silicon Valley engineer is on a quest to green the world by making buildings smarter|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nVerdigris participated in the Stanford accelerator, [[StartX]], and as one of the StartX Notable Companies was invested in by [[Stanford University]]. Verdigris was also one of the 10 inaugural winners of the [[Founder.org]] competition and invested in by Founder.org Capital.

Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information than any other solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than utility smart meters every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to \u201clearn\u201d a building's equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data.\n\nVerdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model. It reads a building's energy usage in real time, and, combined with weather or building occupancy, produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption (kW).\n\nThe Verdigris system is certified for use in 38 countries including the United States, the European Union (32 countries), China, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Canada.\n\n==Company history==\nVerdigris co-founder and CEO Mark Chung came up with the idea for Verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill. The local utility could not provide Chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity. Chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters, hacked them to be wi-fi enabled, and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house. He found the problem, a broken pool pump, and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-23/silicon-valley-engineer-quest-green-world-making-buildings-smarter|title=A Silicon Valley engineer is on a quest to green the world by making buildings smarter|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nVerdigris participated in the Stanford accelerator, [[StartX]], and as one of the StartX Notable Companies was invested in by [[Stanford University]].

In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]].

FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2.

The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization.

The club had a couple of successful seasons in the [[Gauliga]] era, winning the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]] in [[1939 German football championship|1939]] and [[1942 German football championship|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. In the German football championship 1939 competition, Schweinfurt barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the first round of the 1942 German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

FC Kaiserslautern]] in 1954.<ref name=\"Stadioncheck\">{{cite web|title=Willy-Sachs-Stadion, 1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry. Wavebreakers have been installed on the standing rooms in 2014 to safeguard the stadium's full capacity.<ref name=\"In und um SW\">{{cite web|title=Im Schweinfurter Willy-Sachs-Stadion werden gerade die Wellenbrecher errichtet|trans-title=Wavebreakers for the Willy-Sachs-Stadion|periodical=|publisher=in-und-um-schweinfurt.de|url=https://in-und-um-schweinfurt.de/lokales/2014/09/25/im-schweinfurter-willy-sachs-stadion-werden-gerade-die-wellenbrecher-errichtet/|work=|language=German|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|29 January 2020}}|<ref name=\"Staff\">{{cite web|title=Mannschaftskader 1.
