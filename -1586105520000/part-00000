The protagonist is Julia Martin, Rhys's fictional counterpart.

Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after exiting Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved in to Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quay des Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time.

It is terrible, but it is superb.\"<ref>West, Rebecca, ''The Pursuit of Misery in Some New Novels'', Books of the Day, The Daily Telegraph, 30 January 1931, 7</ref>\n\n[[Gerald Gould]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' called the novel: \"A hard, clean, dry, desperate book, so rigid in its economy that its impressiveness seems almost contemptuous.\" Deeming it not a \"pleasant\" novel, Gould wrote \"it has more important merits.\" He concluded: \"Of its kind, and within its limits, this book is a flawless work of art.\"<ref>Gould, Gerald, ''All Sorts of Societies'', New Novels, The Observer 7289, 8 February 1931</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The mirror image: The representation of social roles for women in novels by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton and Jean Rhys|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/nl/publications/the-mirror-image(843bf106-13d1-4fb0-b3e0-146f6b1fd32d).html|publisher=University of Groningen|date=2011|language=English|first=G.

It is no defect in the work\". Impressed by the economy of Rhys's style, he added: \"Julia\u2019s existence and the existence of those with whom she came in contact are somehow made meaningful by these very meaningless odds and ends of observation.\"<ref>Stone, Geoffrey, ''Bookman'', 74, New York, September 1931, 84</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Carole Angier|Angier, Carole]], ''Jean Rhys: Life and Work'', London, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1990\n* Pizzichini, Lilian, ''The Blue Hour: A Life of Jean Rhys'', New York, W.
