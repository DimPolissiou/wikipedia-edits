He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London grime scene, including [[Roll Deep]] and [[Boy Better Know]]. Skepta released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007. It was released on the Boy Better Know label. Skepta self-released the first single \"[[Rolex Sweep]]\" in September 2008, which reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. The single \"Too Many Man\", with JME, Wiley, Frisco and Shorty, charted at number 79.\n\nSkepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label): \"[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]\", \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\", \"[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]\" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], \"[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]\" and \"[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]\", as well as a video for \"[[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]]\" (Grime Remix). Three singles reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\" being the most successful at number 14. \"Cross My Heart\" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' it Again'' spent three weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his forthcoming fourth album.\n\nSkepta's second major label album, ''The Honeymoon'', was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. This was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release. In March 2014, Skepta provided a verse for the remix of \"[[German Whip]]\" by [[Meridian Dan]]. In the same month, he debuted his new single, \"[[That's Not Me (Skepta song)|That's Not Me]]\", featuring his brother, [[JME (rapper)|JME]]. Released on 8 June 2014, the song peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the UK:\n* For all except noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5188/skepta/|title=Skepta|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* For \"Too Many Man\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: DJ S - The System Of Life|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Lush\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/091031cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 31.10.2009 (wk43)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For ''Microphone Champion'': {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/090613cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 13.06.2009 (wk23)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Amnesia\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110212cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 12.02.2011 (wk5)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"It Ain't Safe\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/160514cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 14.05.2016 (wk19)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br/><ref name=\"AUS\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Skepta|title=Discography Skepta|publisher=Australian Charts Portal.

He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London grime scene, including [[Roll Deep]] and [[Boy Better Know]]. Skepta released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007. It was released on the Boy Better Know label. Skepta self-released the first single \"[[Rolex Sweep]]\" in September 2008, which reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. The single \"Too Many Man\", with JME, Wiley, Frisco and Shorty, charted at number 79.\n\nSkepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label): \"[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]\", \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\", \"[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]\" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], \"[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]\" and \"[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]\", as well as a video for \"[[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]]\" (Grime Remix). Three singles reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\" being the most successful at number 14. \"Cross My Heart\" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' it Again'' spent three weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his forthcoming fourth album.\n\nSkepta's second major label album, ''The Honeymoon'', was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. This was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release. In March 2014, Skepta provided a verse for the remix of \"[[German Whip]]\" by [[Meridian Dan]]. In the same month, he debuted his new single, \"[[That's Not Me (Skepta song)|That's Not Me]]\", featuring his brother, [[JME (rapper)|JME]]. Released on 8 June 2014, the song peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the UK:\n* For all except noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5188/skepta/|title=Skepta|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* For \"Too Many Man\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: DJ S - The System Of Life|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Lush\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/091031cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 31.10.2009 (wk43)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For ''Microphone Champion'': {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/090613cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 13.06.2009 (wk23)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Amnesia\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110212cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 12.02.2011 (wk5)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"It Ain't Safe\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/160514cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 14.05.2016 (wk19)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br/><ref name=\"AUS\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Skepta|title=Discography Skepta|publisher=Australian Charts Portal.

The story continues the adventures of four best friends who own a magical pair of jeans that fit all of them, even though they are different sizes. During the summer, the girls share the pants. The book is the second installment in a series of five books:  ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'' (2001), ''[[Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood|Girls in Pants]]'' (2004), ''[[Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood|Forever in Blue]]'' (2007), and ''[[Sisterhood Everlasting]]'' (2011).\n\nThe book was one of three adapted into a film ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2]]'' (2008).\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Sisterhood===\n*'''[[Lena Kaligaris]]''', sometimes called Lenny,  is a beautiful, quiet, and shy artist of Greek heritage. She has a sister, Effie, who is fourteen years old. Lena spent last summer with their paternal grandparents in [[Santorini]], Greece, where Lena met and fell in love with Kostos. They sent letters back and forth until January, when Lena ended their correspondence because she couldn't stand missing him all year. She is shocked, then elated, when Kostos visits America during this summer. They reunite and profess their love for each other, and spend many happy hours kissing. Then, suddenly, something comes up and Kostos has to leave, leaving her behind to wonder what was wrong. Lena and her family soon travel to Greece when they learn that her Bapi has had a stroke; when they arrive there, they learn that he has died. Lena is devastated and becomes even more so when she finds out that Kostos is now married. He tells her that, after she broke up with him, he was depressed and slept with a woman, who is now pregnant. Kostos tells her that he doesn't love his wife, but must be a \"gentleman\" and marry her. He makes it clear, though, that he loves Lena and always will. At the end of the summer, Lena meets Carmen's stepbrother, Paul. They are attracted to each other and Carmen exchanged the 'Love Pants' with her so that Lena could wear them while she talked to Paul.\n* '''[[Tabitha Anastasia \"Tibby\" Tomko-Rollins|Tibby Rollins]]''' is the rebellious daughter of former radicals. Her interest in filmmaking leads her to spend the summer taking a course at Williamston College. When she is here she meets a boy named Alex. In her efforts to impress two jaded classmates, she makes a hurtful movie about her mother and ignores her close friend Brian McBrian, who visits her at college to be with her. But after seeing how upset her mother is about her film, Tibby begins to reevaluate her actions, realizing that her friend Bailey, who died last summer of leukemia, would disapprove of her. She eventually ditches her new friends in favor of Brian and makes a heartfelt movie about Bailey instead.\n* '''[[Bridget \"Bee\" Vreeland]]''' used to be a spunky and full of life soccer star who was described as \"single-minded to the point of recklessness.\" But after rushing into a relationship with her coach, Eric, last summer, Bridget has withdrawn into herself, becoming quiet and sedentary, and she quit playing soccer.  She discovers letters written to her and her brother by her maternal grandmother, Greta Randolph, following her mother's death, and journeys to Alabama to visit Greta. She hides her identity for most of the summer, pretending to be \"Gilda,\" a girl who offers to help Greta around the house in order to earn money for college. She learns a great deal about her grandparents and her mother, and in doing so, she starts to rediscover the old Bridget, including her love of soccer. At the summer's end, she reveals her true identity to her grandmother, who confesses that she knew all along, and they form a strong bond.\n* '''[[Carmen Lowell|Carmen Lucille Lowell]]''' is the sensitive, and caring, half-[[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] \"with the bad temper.\" Carmen's parents are divorced, and she lives with her mother, Christina. This summer, she is angered and frightened when her mother's relationship with David, a coworker, seems to be getting serious. Carmen worries that her mother is moving ahead with her life and leaving her behind. Carmen's attempts to foster her own romance with Porter, a classmate, are hindered by the distraction of her mother's new relationship. She criticizes her mother's actions, leading to Christina and David's break-up, and her mother's resulting depression causes her to realize that her mother deserves happiness, even if Carmen feels threatened by it. She helps to reunite David and Christina.\n\n===From Santorini, Greece===\n*'''Valia''' and '''Bapi''' Kaligaris are Lena and Effie's grandparents. Valia is talkative and spirited, like Effie, while Bapi is quiet and introspective like Lena. Bapi dies of a stroke at the end of the summer.\n*'''Kostos Dounas''' lives with his paternal grandparents in Santorini. He and Lena fell in love at the end of last summer, but she broke off their correspondence because she wanted to feel like her life \"belonged to just her again,\" not wanting to live her life missing Kostas and yearning to spend time with him. They reunite briefly this summer, which ultimately ends in more heartbreak because she finds out that when she broke up with Kostas, he got a woman pregnant, and now feels like he has to marry her because of what he did.\n\n===In Bethesda, Maryland===\n*'''Brian McBrian''' is a video game aficionado who spent hours every day playing ''Dragon Master'' at Seven Eleven, until he met Tibby last summer (through Bailey) and began spending most of his time with her. He has an unhappy home life with his mother and abusive stepfather, whom his mother married after his father died. He goes to visit Tibby at her summer college and is hurt when she dumps him for her new friends, although he ultimately forgives her. Tibby's friends believe that he has romantic feelings for her, although he does not reveal them in the 2nd book.\n*'''Porter''' is Carmen's classmate with whom she goes on a few dates over the summer. Although he genuinely likes her, Carmen is too distracted by her mother's romance and her aspirations for an accessory-like \"Boyfriend\" to start much of a relationship with him.\n\n===At Williamston College===\n*'''Alex''' is a fellow summer film student. Tibby finds him intriguing, talented, and attractive, and she tries to impress him. She even shuns Brian when it becomes clear that Alex dislikes him.

He married Lydia Rodman last summer.\n*'''Lydia Rodman-Lowell''' is Al's second wife and the mother of Carmen's step-siblings, Paul and Krista.\n*'''Paul Rodman''' is two years older than Carmen and has an alcoholic father.

At the end of the summer, he meets Lena at a restaurant, and seems fascinated by her. They seem to have their own quiet chemistry.\n*'''Krista Rodman''' is Carmen's age. She and Carmen did not get along when they met last summer, but this summer Krista runs away to Bethesda in an effort to convince her mother that she wants to have her own identity.\n\n===In Alabama===\n*'''Greta Randolph''' is Bridget's grandmother who, like Bridget's mother, suffers from diabetes. Greta was cut off from Bridget because of her bad relationship with Bridget's father. Over the summer, Bridget takes the name Gilda Tomko (combining the names of the gym where the Septembers first met and Tibby's mother's maiden name) to meet and work for Greta and obtain information about her mother. Greta, who was never fooled by the alias, helps Bridget discover her mother's past.\n*'''Billy Kline''' is Bridget's childhood friend, was in the same soccer team when they were kids, and became her holiday fling in Alabama. He is also known to be her little childhood boyfriend who still has feelings for her.\n\n===Family members of the Sisterhood===\n*'''Georgos \"George\" Kaligaris''' is Lena's strict Greek father.

Effie loves having boys be around her.\n*'''Franz Vreeland''' is Bridget's father, a former history professor and a teacher at a private high school. When Bridget was little, his favorite part of the day was when she would put his socks on for him because he doesn't have good things in his life since his wife died. He hasn't been very close to Bridget in her teenage years.\n*'''Marlene \"Marly\" Randolph Vreeland''' is Bridget's late mother, who committed suicide six and a half years ago after attending mental institutes and suffering from diabetes.\n*'''Perry Vreeland''' is Bridget's twin brother who shared a childhood with the Sisterhood but grew up to be a reclusive teenager. He was named for Marly's brother, Pervis Randolph.\n*'''Christina \"Tina\" Lowell''' is Carmen's 38-year-old mother. She is Puerto Rican and works as a treasurer for a law firm. She has never seriously dated since her divorce almost ten years ago, until this summer.\n*'''Mr. Rollins''' is Tibby's father. He is a lawyer who used to work as a public defender.

The ''Historia Augusta'' refers to the deity Elagabalus as \"also called Jupiter and Sol\" (''fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis'').<ref>Historia Augusta, 1, 5: English translation (Loeb) from Thayer [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#note14] & Latin text [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html]</ref> While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome,<ref>See in particular Halsberghe 1972.</ref> the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome since the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]].<ref>Hijmans 1996, Matern 2001, Wallraff 2002, Berrens 2004, {{harvtxt|Hijmans|2009}}).</ref>\n\n== Aurelian ==\n[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|thumb|Roman Imperial [[repouss\u00e9]] [[silver]] disc of Sol Invictus (3rd century), found at [[Pessinus]] ([[British Museum]])]]\n\nThe Roman [[Aurelia (gens)|''gens Aurelia'']] was associated with the cult of Sol.<ref>J.C.

Where previously priests of Sol had been simply ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society,<ref>{{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=504\u20135}}</ref> they were now ''pontifices'' and members of the new [[College of Pontiffs|college of pontifices]] instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.<ref>For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J.&nbsp;Rupke (ed.), ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' (2005), p. 606. [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] lists his priesthoods as pontifex of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], one of the [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]], and pontifex of Sol, in that order (''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' vol.&nbsp;6, 1739\u20131742). In a list of eight priesthoods, [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] puts ''Pontifex Solis'' in third place ({{CIL|6|1779}}).</ref> Aurelian also built a new [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|temple for Sol]], which was dedicated on December 25, 274,<ref name=\"auto\" /> and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four.<ref>The other three were in the Circus Maximus, on the Quirinal, and in Trastevere.{{harv|Hijmans|2009|loc=chapter 5}}</ref> He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards.\n\nThe identity of Aurelian's Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the ''[[Augustan History]]'', some scholars have argued that it was based on [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Elagablus]] (or Elagabla) of [[Emesa]]. Others, basing their argument on [[Zosimus]], suggest that it was based on the [[Shamash|\u0160ams]], the solar god of [[Palmyra]] on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|last=Dirven|first=Lucinda|title=The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004115897|page=169|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208141034/https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|archivedate=2015-12-08}}</ref> Professor Gary Forsythe discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one based on the work of Steven Hijmans.

To Hijmans this implies the radiate crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as \"saviour of the Republic\" through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios.

Once installed as emperor, he neglected Rome's traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome's most powerful deity. This ended with his murder in 222. The ''Historia Augusta'' refers to the deity Elagabalus as \"also called Jupiter and Sol\" (''fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis'').<ref>Historia Augusta, 1, 5: English translation (Loeb) from Thayer [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#note14] & Latin text [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html]</ref> While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome,<ref>See in particular Halsberghe 1972.</ref> the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome since the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]].<ref>Hijmans 1996, Matern 2001, Wallraff 2002, Berrens 2004, {{harvtxt|Hijmans|2009}}).</ref>\n\n== Aurelian ==\n[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|thumb|Roman Imperial [[repouss\u00e9]] [[silver]] disc of Sol Invictus (3rd century), found at [[Pessinus]] ([[British Museum]])]]\n\nThe Roman [[Aurelia (gens)|''gens Aurelia'']] was associated with the cult of Sol.<ref>J.C. Richard, \"Le culte de Sol et les Aurelii: \u00c0 propos de Paul Fest. p. 22 L.\", in ''M\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 [[Jacques Heurgon]]: L'Italie pr\u00e9romaine et la Rome r\u00e9publicaine'' (Rome, 1976), 915\u2013925.</ref> After his victories in the East, the Emperor [[Aurelian]] thoroughly reformed the Roman cult of Sol, elevating the sun-god to one of the premier divinities of the Empire. Where previously priests of Sol had been simply ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society,<ref>{{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=504\u20135}}</ref> they were now ''pontifices'' and members of the new [[College of Pontiffs|college of pontifices]] instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.<ref>For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J.&nbsp;Rupke (ed.), ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' (2005), p. 606. [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] lists his priesthoods as pontifex of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], one of the [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]], and pontifex of Sol, in that order (''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' vol.&nbsp;6, 1739\u20131742). In a list of eight priesthoods, [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] puts ''Pontifex Solis'' in third place ({{CIL|6|1779}}).</ref> Aurelian also built a new [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|temple for Sol]], which was dedicated on December 25, 274,<ref name=\"auto\" /> and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four.<ref>The other three were in the Circus Maximus, on the Quirinal, and in Trastevere.{{harv|Hijmans|2009|loc=chapter 5}}</ref> He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards.\n\nThe identity of Aurelian's Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the ''[[Augustan History]]'', some scholars have argued that it was based on [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Elagablus]] (or Elagabla) of [[Emesa]]. Others, basing their argument on [[Zosimus]], suggest that it was based on the [[Shamash|\u0160ams]], the solar god of [[Palmyra]] on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|last=Dirven|first=Lucinda|title=The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004115897|page=169|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208141034/https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|archivedate=2015-12-08}}</ref> Professor Gary Forsythe discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one based on the work of Steven Hijmans.

Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6.

Sol is depicted sporadically on imperial coins in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, then more frequently from [[Septimius Severus]] onwards until AD 325/6. ''Sol invictus'' appears on coin legends from AD 261, well before the reign of Aurelian.<ref>Berrens 2004, precise p. number to follow.

[[Augustus]] was posthumously depicted with radiate crown, as were living emperors from [[Nero]] (after AD 65) to [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial radiate crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations that would otherwise be politically controversial<ref>Bergmann 1998, 121\u2013123</ref><ref>S.

To Hijmans this implies the radiate crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as \"saviour of the Republic\" through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios. Wreaths awarded to victors at the [[Actia|Actian Games]] were radiate.<ref>Hijmans 2009, 509\u2013548.

For the 2002\u201303 season, the Lakers joined the [[College Hockey America]] conference.\n\n==Season by season results==\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties''\n{|

Association'''\n\nThe Mercyhurst women's hockey program predates NCAA governance in the sport. The Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association was formed by Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, when the Title IX law protecting equity in sports was making major changes to women's athletics.\n\nA Mercyhurst Men's Assistant Coach since 1993, Michael Sisti, was named the inaugural head coach. As of the end of the 2019\u201320 season, he remains the only head coach in the program's history. Sisti had been a star forward for Canisius College, where he graduated in 1990.\n\nMercyhurst was immediately successful in the GLWHA. They were 23-6-0 in 1999\u201300. Most of their games were shutout wins, and scored 10 or more goals on six occasions.\n\nIn 2000-01 they were far less successful, going 14-16-3, playing more established programs.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, they saw great success again, with a 24-8-1 record, and the final GLWHA Championship.\n\n'''College Hockey America through 2005-06'''\n\nAs the NCAA became the primary governing body of women's hockey, the conferences began to merge with existing men's conferences. The Mercyhurst men were part of the Metro Atlantic Conference, while Findlay and Wayne States' mens programs were in [[College Hockey America]], which began organizing as a women's conference as well. The new CHA women's conference included Mercyhust, Findlay and Wayne State from the GLWHA, and Niagara University.\n\nIn the first four years of the conference, Mercyhurst dominated the competition. Within the conference, they were 38-1-3, winning every regular season, and every tournament. Their overall record was 102-29-13 for the same period. In the first two years of the conference, the CHA a smaller conference against much more storied conferences, like the ECAC and the WCHA. As a result, Mercyhurst did not receive a bid to appear in the NCAA Tournament. In 2005, the Lakers received their first bid, traveling to powerful Harvard University on March 19. The ensuing game was one of the most bitterly fought in tournament history, with Harvard prevailing 5\u20134 in the third overtime period. During that game, Mercyhurst goaltender Desi Clark set a single game save record of 78 stops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_icehockey_rb/2020/D1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Division I Women\u2019s Records|website=Fs.ncaa.org|accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> That record still stands at the Division I level as of the end of the 2019\u201320 season. In the following year, the Lakers had similar bad luck, this time losing to Wisconsin in 2 overtimes.\n\nThe CHA Conference saw some changes, as Findlay dropped their program in 2004, and the Robert Morris Colonials joining for 2005\u201306, after Quinnipiac joined for a single year (2004\u201305).\n\n'''The Meghan Agosta years'''\n\nBy the mid-2000s Mercyhurst College (it would become Mercyhurst University in 2012), had several advantages in recruiting: The college itself, a small Catholic institustion with very good academics; The success and graduation rate of its athletes; and, the overwhelming success of the team. The campus location near Lake Ontario was attractive to young women from Ontario, New York and Pennsylvania, a large pool of talent.\n\nIn 2006, the Lakers attracted [[Megan Agosta]], perhaps the most sought-after talent in the NCAA. Even before attending college, she had won an Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Turin games with Team Canada. She became one of the best players of the decade in NCAA play.\n\nAgosta would be the first ever freshman to be a top three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cdn2.sportngin.com/attachments/document/f304-2130731/ALL_TIME_PATTYKAZ.pdf#_ga=2.55151595.1161681440.1585364091-252096202.1583618013 |title=All time Patty kaz statistics |publisher=The Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award.com  |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Mercyhurst successfully recruited [[Vicki Bendus]], who would win the 2010 [[Patty Kazmaier Award]] as the nation's top player, and was a top-10 finalist in the following year.\n\nIn addition, the Lakers recruited Katariina Soikkanen of the Finnish National team, as well as Angelica Lorsell and Johanna Malmstrom who played for the Swedish National Team. The Lakers also had four players on the roster who played on the Canadian Under-22 Team. Mercyhurst had two CHA First Team selections in 2006\u201307, one second team choice, the Player and Rookie of the Year, and four members of the All-Rookie Team.\n\nWith the addition of these players, in addition to a potent roster in totalit, Mercyhurst achieved even more success.\n\nDuring her college career, Agosta would score 157 goals and 303 points, both NCAA records. Her international play meant substantial time off from the Mercyhirst team, making these records all the more impressive.\n\nThe best year in Mercyhurst history came in 2009\u201310. In that season, the Lakers started the season with a record of 19 wins, 1 loss and 3 ties (Conference Record, 6\u20130\u20131). They were the top ranked team in the USA TODAY/USA Hockey Magazine poll for 14 consecutive weeks and were the unanimous choice with all 19 first-place votes eight times. Their only loss came in an October home split with Minnesota-Duluth<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/hockey/2010-01-27-mercyhurst-lakers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Being No. 1 doesn't faze Lakers; WCHA teams dominate top 15 | first=Eddie | last=Timanus | date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> until the Nation Championship game against Wisconsin on March 22, 2009, which they lost 5\u20130. It was the Laker's only NCAA Championship Game. During that season, Meghan Agosto took time away to participate in her second Olympic games, this time in Vancouver, Canada. She won her second gold medal and was named the Most Valuable Player in women's hockey in the Olympic Games.\n\n'''Continued Success in the 2010s'''\n\nTo date, the Mercyhurst program continues to be successful, if no longer dominant in the CHA conference. In 2013 and 2014, the Lakers appeared in back-to-back Frozen Four contests. These teams were led by forward [[Christine Bestland]], a captain for two years, national recognition by USCHO. com, and two time MVP of the CHA conference.\n\nUpon Bestland's graduation, Mercyhurst's successes were more modest, despite the leadership of Forward [[Emily Janiga]] and Defender [[Molly Byrne]]. The Lakers earned their record-setting 10th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Mercyhurst failed to earn a berth in the national tournament, while still posting a 23-9-3 record and a regular season conference title. In the folowing year, the team returned to the tournament after a one-year hiatus.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the Lakers enjoyed success, but contended with rival CHA program Robert Morris for conference leadership. The 2016-17 team posted a 15-18-4 record, their first and only losing record since NCAA competition began in 2001-02, as of the end of 2020. Their 3rd place CHA finish was the lowest ranking in Mercyhurst history, but still good enough for the team to stay in the top tier of the conference.\n\nIn the 2017-18 season, Mercyhurst began to establish a resurgence of top-tier success, with the recruiting of three international medalists from the Finnish National Team: Forward [[Vilma Tanskanen]] (2018-19), Forward [[Emma Nuutinen]](2018- ), and Goaltender [[Jenna Silvonen]] (2019- ).  Tanskanen and Nuutinen were Transfers from the University of North Dakota, following the abrupt cancellation of that school's program. Nuutinen had the additional accomplishment of earning an Olympic Bronze Medal in 2018.\n\nMercyhurst appeared in another NCAA tournament in 2018, and received a berth in 2020. The 2020 Tournament, however, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 emergency.\n\n==2019\u201320 Lakers Roster==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n<ref>{{cite

Association'''\n\nThe Mercyhurst women's hockey program predates NCAA governance in the sport. The Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association was formed by Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, when the Title IX law protecting equity in sports was making major changes to women's athletics.\n\nA Mercyhurst Men's Assistant Coach since 1993, Michael Sisti, was named the inaugural head coach. As of the end of the 2019\u201320 season, he remains the only head coach in the program's history. Sisti had been a star forward for Canisius College, where he graduated in 1990.\n\nMercyhurst was immediately successful in the GLWHA. They were 23-6-0 in 1999\u201300. Most of their games were shutout wins, and scored 10 or more goals on six occasions.\n\nIn 2000-01 they were far less successful, going 14-16-3, playing more established programs.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, they saw great success again, with a 24-8-1 record, and the final GLWHA Championship.\n\n'''College Hockey America through 2005-06'''\n\nAs the NCAA became the primary governing body of women's hockey, the conferences began to merge with existing men's conferences. The Mercyhurst men were part of the Metro Atlantic Conference, while Findlay and Wayne States' mens programs were in [[College Hockey America]], which began organizing as a women's conference as well. The new CHA women's conference included Mercyhust, Findlay and Wayne State from the GLWHA, and Niagara University.\n\nIn the first four years of the conference, Mercyhurst dominated the competition. Within the conference, they were 38-1-3, winning every regular season, and every tournament. Their overall record was 102-29-13 for the same period. In the first two years of the conference, the CHA a smaller conference against much more storied conferences, like the ECAC and the WCHA. As a result, Mercyhurst did not receive a bid to appear in the NCAA Tournament. In 2005, the Lakers received their first bid, traveling to powerful Harvard University on March 19. The ensuing game was one of the most bitterly fought in tournament history, with Harvard prevailing 5\u20134 in the third overtime period. During that game, Mercyhurst goaltender Desi Clark set a single game save record of 78 stops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_icehockey_rb/2020/D1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Division I Women\u2019s Records|website=Fs.ncaa.org|accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> That record still stands at the Division I level as of the end of the 2019\u201320 season. In the following year, the Lakers had similar bad luck, this time losing to Wisconsin in 2 overtimes.\n\nThe CHA Conference saw some changes, as Findlay dropped their program in 2004, and the Robert Morris Colonials joining for 2005\u201306, after Quinnipiac joined for a single year (2004\u201305).\n\n'''The Meghan Agosta years'''\n\nBy the mid-2000s Mercyhurst College (it would become Mercyhurst University in 2012), had several advantages in recruiting: The college itself, a small Catholic institustion with very good academics; The success and graduation rate of its athletes; and, the overwhelming success of the team. The campus location near Lake Ontario was attractive to young women from Ontario, New York and Pennsylvania, a large pool of talent.\n\nIn 2006, the Lakers attracted [[Megan Agosta]], perhaps the most sought-after talent in the NCAA. Even before attending college, she had won an Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Turin games with Team Canada. She became one of the best players of the decade in NCAA play.\n\nAgosta would be the first ever freshman to be a top three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cdn2.sportngin.com/attachments/document/f304-2130731/ALL_TIME_PATTYKAZ.pdf#_ga=2.55151595.1161681440.1585364091-252096202.1583618013 |title=All time Patty kaz statistics |publisher=The Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award.com  |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Mercyhurst successfully recruited [[Vicki Bendus]], who would win the 2010 [[Patty Kazmaier Award]] as the nation's top player, and was a top-10 finalist in the following year.\n\nIn addition, the Lakers recruited Katariina Soikkanen of the Finnish National team, as well as Angelica Lorsell and Johanna Malmstrom who played for the Swedish National Team. The Lakers also had four players on the roster who played on the Canadian Under-22 Team. Mercyhurst had two CHA First Team selections in 2006\u201307, one second team choice, the Player and Rookie of the Year, and four members of the All-Rookie Team.\n\nWith the addition of these players, in addition to a potent roster in totalit, Mercyhurst achieved even more success.\n\nDuring her college career, Agosta would score 157 goals and 303 points, both NCAA records. Her international play meant substantial time off from the Mercyhirst team, making these records all the more impressive.\n\nThe best year in Mercyhurst history came in 2009\u201310. In that season, the Lakers started the season with a record of 19 wins, 1 loss and 3 ties (Conference Record, 6\u20130\u20131). They were the top ranked team in the USA TODAY/USA Hockey Magazine poll for 14 consecutive weeks and were the unanimous choice with all 19 first-place votes eight times. Their only loss came in an October home split with Minnesota-Duluth<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/hockey/2010-01-27-mercyhurst-lakers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Being No. 1 doesn't faze Lakers; WCHA teams dominate top 15 | first=Eddie | last=Timanus | date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> until the Nation Championship game against Wisconsin on March 22, 2009, which they lost 5\u20130. It was the Laker's only NCAA Championship Game. During that season, Meghan Agosto took time away to participate in her second Olympic games, this time in Vancouver, Canada. She won her second gold medal and was named the Most Valuable Player in women's hockey in the Olympic Games.\n\n'''Continued Success in the 2010's'''\n\nTo date, the Mercyhurst program continues to be successful, if no longer dominant in the CHA conference. In 2013 and 2014, the Lakers appeared in back-to-back Frozen Four contests. These teams were led by forward [[Christine Bestland]], a captain for two years, national recognition by USCHO. com, and two time MVP of the CHA conference.\n\nUpon Bestland's graduation, Mercyhurst's successes were more modest, despite the leadership of Forward [[Emily Janiga]] and Defender [[Molly Byrne]]. The Lakers earned their record-setting 10th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Mercyhurst failed to earn a berth in the national tournament, while still posting a 23-9-3 record and a regular season conference title. In the folowing year, the team returned to the tournament after a one-year hiatus.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the Lakers enjoyed success, but contended with rival CHA program Robert Morris for conference leadership. The 2016-17 team posted a 15-18-4 record, their first and only losing record since NCAA competition began in 2001-02, as of the end of 2020. Their 3rd place CHA finish was the lowest ranking in Mercyhurst history, but still good enough for the team to stay in the top tier of the conference.\n\nIn the 2017-18 season, Mercyhurst began to establish a resurgence of top-tier success, with the recruiting of three international medalists from the Finnish National Team: Forward [[Vilma Tanskanen]] (2018-19), Forward [[Emma Nuutinen]](2018- ), and Goaltender [[Jenna Silvonen]] (2019- ).  Tanskanen and Nuutinen were Transfers from the University of North Dakota, following the abrupt cancellation of that school's program. Nuutinen had the additional accomplishment of earning an Olympic Bronze Medal in 2018.\n\nMercyhurst appeared in another NCAA tournament in 2018, and received a berth in 2020. The 2020 Tournament, however, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 emergency.\n\n==2019\u201320 Lakers Roster==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n<ref>{{cite
